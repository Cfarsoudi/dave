     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back
     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We
     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF
     SCREEN.

     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

                               MICKEY
                    What kind of pies do you have?

                               MABEL
                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

                               MICKEY
                    Which do you recommend?

                               MABEL
                    The key lime is great, but it's
                    an acquired taste.

                               MICKEY
                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten
                    years.

                               MABEL
                    When ya had it, did ya like it?

                               MICKEY
                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a
                    completely different person ten years
                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in
                    court. And a large glass of milk.

     Mabel turns to her right.
 
                               MABEL
                         (to someone O.S.)
                    Should I make that two pieces?

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back
     is to the camera as well.

                               MALLORY
                    Nada, Rosey.

                               MABEL
                         (annoyed)
                    My name's not Rosey.
                         (points at name tag)
                    It's Mabel.

     Mabel exits FRAME.

                               MALLORY
                    Whatever.

     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next
     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,
     she selects a quarter.

                               MABEL
                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're
                    doin'?

     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes
     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
     shop.

     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

                               MABEL
                         (to Mickey)
                    She ought not be doing that. That's
                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time
     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

                               MICKEY
                    I can't take her anywhere.

     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
     hell these people are.

     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his
     pie and milk.

     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls
     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three
     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the
     pickup's hood.

                               EARL
                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.
                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er
                    out.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of
     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

                               SONNY
                    Good God almighty. What the hell is
                    that?

                               OTIS
                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.

     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

                               SONNY
                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next
     to Mickey.

                               SONNY
                    Miller, Mabel.

                               MABEL
                    Comin' up.

     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
     him.

     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a
     swig, enjoying the floor show.

                               SONNY
                         (to Mickey)
                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't
                    it?

     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression
     betrays nothing.

                               MICKEY
                    Her name's Mallory.

     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

                               OTIS
                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.
                    I'm just getting warmed up.

     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
     Sonny.

     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

                               SONNY
                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
     spinning him around.

     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the
     table, cracking the linoleum.

     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches
     hold of his shoulder.

     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points
     his finger at him, threateningly.

     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.
     Blood flows from the wound.

                               MICKEY
                    Just because my woman's mopping up the
                    floor with your buddy is no reason for
                    you to join in.

     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck
     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be
     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices
     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,
     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
     his jacket and FIRES.

     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It
     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
     the ground, screaming.

     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass
     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the
     ground dead.

     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING
     his head repeatedly on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Honey.

     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to
     Mickey's side.

     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
     pot, crying.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Pick one.

     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

                               MALLORY
                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a
                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let
                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My
                    mom told me to pick the best one and
                    you are it.

     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

                               MABEL
                    NO!

     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She
     hits the floor dead.

     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

                               MALLORY
                    When you tell people what went on here,
                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did
                    this. Understand?

     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.
     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

     END CREDIT SEQUENCE

     Over black screen, we hear:

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI
                    Send Scagnetti in here.

     INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY

     CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in
     the middle of the frame.

     JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's
     office. Squeri's never seen.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room
                    C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the
                    prison board, is waiting to meet you.
                    You're gonna deliver two prisoners from
                    the county jail to Nystrom Insane
                    Asylum in Bakersfield.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    This is bullshit. I'm a detective.
                    You want an errand boy, call Jerry
                    Lewis.

     Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door
     shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Jack!

     INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

     Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,
     wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

     PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already
     tied tie over his head.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY

     DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,
     stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.
     In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

     McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,
                    Scagnetti. You put an end to a
                    nightmare. The ladies of this city can
                    get to sleep again, and they have you
                    to thank.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thank you, sir.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Dewight McClusky of the California
                    Prison Board. Take a seat please.

     Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation
     table.

                               MCCLUSKY
                         (referring to book)
                    This is damn good reading. I'm
                    surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.
                    This would make a better movie than
                    that 'Serpico' shit.

     McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The
     Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.
     McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He
     lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    I think you'll find that good reading
                    as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.
                    You familiar with them?

     Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs
     of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who isn't?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You been followin' the news coverage?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've been separated since their
                    incarceration in a couple of
                    penitentiaries---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Susanville, Soledade.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've killed a shitload of inmates
                    and guards---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Five inmates, eight guards and one
                    psychiatrist all in one year's time...
                    Very good. You do keep up with the
                    headlines.

     Scagnetti nods.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Look, our situation in a nutshell is,
                    no prison wants 'em, no prison will
                    take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,
                    where the warden's as hard as a bar of
                    iron. No one wants those fuckin'
                    assholes behind their walls, dealin'
                    with 'em day in, day out.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I can appreciate that.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    So can we. So the solution to our
                    little problem is we had them deemed
                    crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to
                    Nystrom Asylum for the criminally
                    insane.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Lobotomy Bay?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You've heard of it?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, how do I fit into this scheme?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The public loves you Jack...You don't
                    mind if I call you Jack, do you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    By all means.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six
                    years on the force, a best-seller out on
                    paperback...

     McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent
                    lawman with a deadly axe to grind with
                    maniacs.

     McClusky lowers the book.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a breathing icon of justice and
                    that's why you were chosen to deliver
                    Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison
                    board we, knows that once you get them
                    on the road if anything should happen,
                    an escape attempt, an accident, fire,
                    anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti
                    would be there to look out for his
                    public's best interests.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I see.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You write the script Jack, call it,
                    'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination
                    of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...
                    Have we found our man?

     Hold on Scagnetti.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY

     SCAGNETTI'S POV: McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He
     BANGS on it with is fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through
     this scene.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through
                    with a visitor!

     A BUZZER SOUNDS

     McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As
     soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the
     song 'Long Time Woman'.

     McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my
                    years with the penal institution, and
                    I'll tell ya that's no small number,
                    Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a
                    doubt the most twisted, depraved group
                    of fucks it's ever been my displeasure
                    to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two
                    rat shits are a walkin' reminder of
                    just how fucked up our system really
                    is.

     The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Who's the song bird?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Mickey's better half herself. Mallory
                    Knox. This little lady drowned her
                    father in a fish tank.

     INSERT: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CU of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly
     Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

                               MCCLUSKY
                    While the two together burned her
                    mother alive in her bed.

     INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MEDIUM CU of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open.
     What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME,
     pouring gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags.
     CAMERA PANS up and we see Mickey holding a gas can.

     CU of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in
     front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV:

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Why?

     McClusky's still walking ahead of us.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Because they wouldn't give them their
                    blessing for marriage.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Ain't love grand.

     McClusky laughs.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's
     file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color
     of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that
     is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

     As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

                               FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)
                    When pressed about the reason for the
                    murders...patient became hostile...

     INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine
     dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly
     at the CAMERA.

                               MALLORY
                    I don't owe you an explanation! I don't
                    owe you shit! I'm not here for your
                    entertainment. If I don't tell you
                    what you wanna hear, what are you gonna
                    do? Throw me in jail? I'm already
                    there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna
                    give me some more time? I've already
                    got life. What else you got to
                    threaten me with? Death? I'd like to
                    see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one
                    motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

     BACK TO DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:

     Still on SCAGNETTI'S POV:

     We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a
     cell door.

     We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell.

     We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures
     toward the cell.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Here she is...you know her, you
                    love her, you can't live without
                    her...Mallory Knox.

     We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see
     Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing.

     INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY

     CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    99 years is a long, long time. Look at
                    me, I will never be free, I'm a long time
                    woman...

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to
                    meet you.

     Mallory just keeps on truckin'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Been workin' on the road now.
                    Been workin' by the sea.
                    Been workin' in the cane fields.
                    and I wanna be free...

     MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second.
     Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory
     screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV
     flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

     MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

     CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jesus Christ!

     CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Don't worry about it. She does that
                    all the time.

     BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood
     trickling down her scalp.

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Follow me.

     INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY

     CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti
     approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.

     PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                    You duckin' me Dewight?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    This son of a bitch is chairman of the
                    prison board, but it's like pullin'
                    teeth to get him down to a prison.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The only reason I'm here now is to set
                    him straight, and I'm on the next
                    flight out.
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    Jack, this is the superintendent of the
                    jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man
                    who's got the power of the pen here.

     Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

                               WURLITZER
                    Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your
                    book. I'm impressed. Good work on
                    Curtis Fox.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thanks.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    From now on, you'll be dealin' with
                    Phil. He can answer all the questions
                    you got about the arrangements. I'm
                    gonna be bidding you good luck and
                    adieu in about twenty minutes. My
                    flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in
                    a hour.

                               WURLITZER
                    And I want you to know, we'll all cry a
                    river when you're gone.

     They all laugh.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What's the travelling arrangements?

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be
                    together. So, we'll put you on one of
                    our prison busses and you'll take
                    Mallory first, then you'll come back
                    for Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    And where do you keep Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,
                    darkest cell in the whole place. But
                    it just so happens that right now he's
                    got a special visitor.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who?

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne Gayle.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (surprised)
                    Wayne Gayle!

     INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la
     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.
     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a
     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

                               WAYNE
                         (into recorder)
                    Testing one...two...three...
                    testing...one...three...over,
                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It
     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the
     recorder in his sport coat jacket.

     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
     and feet are double cuffed.

     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
     intimidating, and fascinating figure.

     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                         (to himself)
                    Showtime.

     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of
     the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by
     the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello Mickey. We've never been
                    introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I
                    don't know if you've ever heard of me
                    or remember me. I was one of the
                    reporters outside the courthouse during
                    your trial---

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody knows who you are. You're
                    famous.

     Wayne pauses and retorts.

                               WAYNE
                    I could say the same thing about you.
                         (smiles)
                    I want to thank you very much for
                    seeing me...

     Mickey is silent.

                               WAYNE
                    I have a television show. It's very
                    popular. Every week we do a profile on
                    a different serial killer. You don't
                    mind if I call you a serial killer, do
                    you?

     Mickey shakes his head no.

                               WAYNE
                    The episode we did on Mickey and
                    Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               MICKEY
                    Whose ratings were higher?

                               WAYNE
                    Yours.

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on
                    him?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

                               MICKEY
                    Good...yuppie piece of shit.

                               WAYNE
                    What I'd like to do---

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Manson?

                               WAYNE
                    Manson beat you.

                               MICKEY
                    Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the
                    king.

                               WAYNE
                    We've been waiting to do a follow up
                    episode on you for a long time. And
                    that time has definitely come.
                         (pause)
                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
                    hip to what's going on that the prison
                    board has thrown the constitution
                    straight out the fuckin' window.
                    You and Mallory may be killers, but
                    you're not insane. You belong in a
                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison
                    board is blatantly railroading you into
                    a hospital for the sole purpose of
                    turning you into vegetables. Now some
                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
                    one of those people. If we avert our
                    eyes while they do this to you, we give
                    them permission to do it again whenever
                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean
                    your mind because they feel your
                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
                    wipe clean my mind because they feel
                    what I say is dangerous. Where does
                    it all stop?

     No response from Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't
                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
                    on this. I need your help. I want
                    what the prison board is doing to be
                    the focus of our follow up episode.
                    Now I have interviews with chairman of
                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about
                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two
                    psychologists they used for their
                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
                    to us, which always looks bad. I have
                    an interview with both the judge of
                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
                    psychologist and author, Emil
                    Reinghold, both of which discount the
                    notion that you're insane. You put
                    that all together, and what the state
                    is doing becomes obvious. But the
                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the
                    show needs another element. It needs
                    you. In order to put the show on the
                    air, I need to get an interview with
                    you. You haven't talked to the press
                    since your trial. Now, a few days
                    before you get transferred to an
                    asylum, you grant an interview on
                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're
                    talkin' a media event here. Every son
                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's
                    gonna tune in to see that.
                    We'll make their motives so blatant,
                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
                    thing. At least for a little while,
                    the publicity would keep them from just
                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
                    Well, whatta ya say?

                               MICKEY
                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?

                               WAYNE
                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now
                    you're not supposed to know anything
                    about what's going on with her, but I'm
                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you
                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't
                    spoken one word.

                               MICKEY
                    She doesn't talk?

                               WAYNE
                    Not to anybody. She sings.

                               MICKEY
                    She sings? What does she sing?

                               WAYNE
                    Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The
                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty
                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be
                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.
                    Her behaviour was the main thing the
                    doctors' report used against you. So
                    even if she would see me, which she
                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera
                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are
                    you insane?' And she starts singing
                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',
                    that blows our whole case.

     Mickey cracks a smile.

     The guards come over to take him away.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Time, motherfucker!

     They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an
                    answer.

     Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

                               WAYNE
                         (yells after him)
                    Just think about it. But don't think
                    too long.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a
     letter.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.
                    At night I get the chills. I pretend
                    you're lying next to me, holding me
                    from behind with your leg draped over
                    mine and your arms wrapped tightly
                    around me. I lie in my cell...

     DISSOLVE TO:

     WIDE SHOT in cell behind Mickey. We slowly DOLLY back.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    ...and imagine kissing you. Not
                    making love, just kissing for hours and
                    hours on end. I remember everything
                    about our time. I remember every joke
                    you ever told.

     CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    I remember every secret you ever
                    shared. Shared or revealed? I think
                    shared is proper. I remember every
                    single time you laughed.

     ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear
     Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember every meal we ever ate. I
                    remember your cooking. I especially
                    remember your casseroles. I remember
                    watching David Letterman.

     We hear the echo of television laughter.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember driving fast...faster,
                    man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe
                    de Ville.

     The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory,
     driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through
     their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around
     Mickey and kisses.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet
                    up on the dash, singing along with the
                    radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A
                    Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of
                    Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary
                    Goes', 'Groove Me'...

     Coupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the
     drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on
     the hood of the car.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    And your dancing, my God, your dancing.
                    I lie on my bed and go over every day,
                    every minute of our happiness. Every
                    day take a day of our time and go
                    through it hour by hour. I don't jump
                    ahead either. I take it as it comes,
                    and I live that day again. That way
                    when I get to our first kiss...

     INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear
     in the flame kissing passionately.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    The killing of your parents, our
                    wedding...They're not just memories.
                    I feel that joy again...

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face
     and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over
     Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

                               WAYNE
                         (reading out loud)
                    'After taking a few days to reflect on
                    your offer, I've come to the conclusion
                    that you are one hundred percent
                    correct. A national TV interview would
                    be very advantageous to both Mallory
                    and I. The only obstacle is they're
                    shipping me out to the funny farm in
                    four days. However, that is your
                    problem and not mine. I feel confident
                    you'll manage. Here's to us making
                    television history. Sincerely, Mickey
                    Knox.'

     Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

                               WAYNE
                    Am I a God or what?

     We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's
     decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
     remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they
     all pretend they are praying to him.

     The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild
     t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On
     Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears
     wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,
     Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a
     baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
     weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his
     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie
     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are
     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's
     stylish yuppie demeanour.

     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold
     out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks
     straight from the bottle.

     NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl
     Friday' pace.

                               WAYNE
                    Drink up! This is a celebration. This
                    is the day we received word we were
                    gonna make television history. We're
                    gonna have the first sit down, in depth
                    interview with the most charismatic
                    serial killer ever, one day before he's
                    being shipped to a mental hospital for
                    the rest of his life. This is one of
                    those golden moments that happens maybe
                    only four times in a lucky journalist's
                    career. This is Wallace with Noriega,
                    this is Elton John confessing his
                    bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this
                    is the tearful reporting of the
                    Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut
                    setting the record straight on
                    Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,
                    this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting
                    Deep Throat in an underground parking
                    lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The
                    Ten Days That Shook The World', this is
                    the hippies' bloody palms at Kent
                    State, the Maysles brothers at
                    Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost
                    interviews...

                               ROGER
                    This is Raymond Burr witnessing the
                    destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

     Everybody laughs.

                               SCOTT
                    What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

     As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.
     She never speaks, just writes.

                               WAYNE
                    We got tonight and tomorrow to get our
                    shit together. The day after that
                    they're shippin' Mallory. That's when
                    we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause
                    the next day he goes.

                               SCOTT
                    Would the network really not run it
                    without the interview?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The last thing they
                    expected was Mickey Knox to get up
                    close and personal. They wanted a
                    follow up episode and would've taken
                    anything I had given them. I'm not
                    gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna
                    make him think his grey matter depends
                    on it. When I told Woody and the brass
                    about this coup, they practically shit
                    a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.
                    They want to expand the show to a hour,
                    and they want it on immediately.

                               ROGER
                    How immediate is immediately?

                               WAYNE
                    Next week's episode.

     Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.

                               ROGER
                    We don't got enough footage for a hour
                    follow up.

                               SCOTT
                         (pointing at Roger)
                    What he said.

                               WAYNE
                    Rape and pillage the first episode,
                    just change the order a bit. Those
                    sons of bitches out there ain't gonna
                    know the difference. All that shit is
                    just filler for the interview anyway.
                    We film a new intro. Show some old
                    footage from the first episode so the
                    get a brief history of Mickey and
                    Mallory. We introduce a new angle...
                    what the prison board is up to. We
                    see some of that new shit, then the
                    rest of the show is the interview. Now
                    what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,
                    Julie make a note: I need Woody to get
                    me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'
                    broadcast to promote next weeks show.
                    We'll do a feed right from the jail
                    while we're wrapping up with Mickey.

     Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    You too Scott, Betacam and a remote,
                    keep it simple.

     Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.

                    footage, put it together, and see what
                    we got. Get it into shape so when we

                    At that point I'll ask him if he
                    believes in God. If he says yes, I'll
                    ask him what he thinks God would make
                    of his actions. And is he worried
                    about burning in hell? If he says no,
                    I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you
                    believe in?' And hopefully he'll say
                    something like a live round of ammo,

                    just split up the middle, Mallory's

     Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and

     looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before,

                    landscape. But to Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox, it was a candy land of murder and
                    mayhem.

     Mallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

     Mickey points his shotgun at Bishop the store clerk and screams:

                    Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast!

     Bishop stuffs money in a bag as Mallory guards the door, shotgun
     ready.

     STEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room
     carrying boxes and wearing a walkman.

     Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him.

     As all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes, Wayne's
     narration happens over it.

                    The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder
                    trial was so event filled it made the
                    crime spree that took place before pale
                    by comparison. The first point was the
                    decision of Mickey's to act as his own
                    council. Now this in itself is not
                    unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy
                    acted as his own council as well. What
                    was unexpected was how well Mickey's

                    Mickey was surprisingly effective.
                    When I was told I was to be the judge
                    of this trial and then I was told
                    Mickey Knox would be handling his own
                    defence, I got a headache that lasted
                    five days. But at first I breathed a
                    sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very
                    prepared, and proved to be an excellent
                    amateur lawyer.

     INT. WANDA BISBING'S OFFICE - DAY

     Interview with state prosecutor WANDA BISBING, an attractive
     woman in her forties.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    However, this opinion isn't shared by
                    the state's prosecutor on this case,
                    Wanda Bisbing.

     Wayne's with Bisbing.

                               WAYNE
                    Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed
                    up very prepared and proved to be an
                    excellent amateur attorney.

                               BISBING
                    Oh, that's rich. Well, considering
                    that Mickey Knox turn his court into
                    a mockery and personally made him look
                    like a fool, I'd say that's very
                    benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far
                    as Mickey being an excellent amateur
                    lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but
                    when I went to law school, we were
                    taught the object was to win the case,
                    which I did.

                    The nation caught fire to Mickey and
                    Mallory fever, Mickey and Mallory
                    mania, if you will, as the merits to
                    Mickey's talent as a defence attorney
                    became apparent.
                    Law students from all ends of the
                    country converged on Los Angeles as
                    legal history took a new course. But
                    that was only the lemon next to the
                    pie. And that pie is you, the American
                    people. That pie is the way the
                    strangely charismatic, and make no
                    mistake, they are charismatic, Mickey
                    and Mallory have captured the public's
                    interest, fear, and in some cases,
                    admiration.

                    two shit asses (BLEEP) the stiffest
                    sentence the law allows. I want to see
                    their faces when the state says 'they
                    are the worst scum sucking, degenerate,
                    douche bag, filthy, I don't know what's

                    is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP)

                    Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya
                    why. Because he was killed in the line
                    of duty. Do you want to know how he
                    died?

                               WAYNE

                               INTENSE COP

                    conquers that of master Melvin Belli.

                               WAYNE
                    What do you think of Mickey and
                    Mallory?

     ECU on SIMON and NORMAN HUN, two brothers/bodybuilders, in a

                               SIMON
                    I admire them.

                               NORMAN
                    I do, too.

                               WAYNE
                         (confused)
                    But how can you say that?

                               SIMON
                    They're mesmerising.

                               NORMAN
                    Hypnotizing.

                               SIMON
                    Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               NORMAN
                    Then you've seen the scene where Arnold
                    Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou
                    Ferigno.

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               SIMON
                    Through the power of the simple word---

                               NORMAN
                    And a snake-eye glare.

                               SIMON
                    ---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was
                    able to totally psyche out any
                    confidence Ferigno had.

                               NORMAN
                    He squashed him mentally before
                    physically defeating him.

                               SIMON
                    He had the edge. The mind's edge.

                               NORMAN
                    Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

                               SIMON
                    Only on a much grander scale.

                               NORMAN
                    They've hypnotized the nation.

                               SIMON
                    Schwartzenegger was the king of the
                    edge before they came along.

     The CU of the brothers ZOOMS back.

                    You say this and yet...you two are
                    both victims of Mickey and Mallory.

     SHOT has zoomed back to reveal that both Simon and Norman are in

                               SIMON
                    Yes.

                               NORMAN
                    Yes.

                               WAYNE
                    How can you say that you 'admire' them?

                               NORMAN
                    It's like this, Wayne. Two people are
                    standing in a dark room waiting for the
                    other to attack. These two people
                    can't see each other, yet they know
                    they're there. Now, they can either
                    stand in the dark room forever waiting
                    until they die of boredom, or one of
                    them can make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    Why can't they just shake hands and be
                    friends?

                               NORMAN
                    They can't because neither knows if the
                    other is a deranged senseless killer
                    like the Knoxs. So, you may as well
                    make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    And they made the first move?

                               NORMAN
                    Unfortunately, yes.

                               SIMON
                    But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    Why?

                               SIMON
                    They passed the 'edge' along to us.

                               WAYNE
                    How so?

                               SIMON
                    By taking away our legs. Now we have
                    to fight harder to get ahead than
                    anyone else you'll find in this gym.
                    Probably the whole city. They gave us
                    the fighting spirit. Before this
                    happened I was content. Now I'm pissed
                    off. Now I'm half a man and I've got
                    to work like the devil to get whole
                    again.

                               WAYNE
                    But you'll never be whole again.

                               SIMON
                    Never is a very long time, Wayne. A
                    word only the weak use. I'm not a sore
                    loser. Even if I don't have a leg to
                    stand on, I'm going to get up and fight
                    this world until I'm on top again.

                               NORMAN
                    That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

                               SIMON
                    That's the way of the world.

                               NORMAN
                    They're shocking the world into
                    remembering the primal law.

                               SIMON
                    Survival of the fittest.

                               WAYNE
                    One last question. Usually Mickey and
                    Mallory kill all of their victims. Why
                    did they let you two survive?

     The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

                               NORMAN
                    They had us tied down during one of
                    their house raids, you've seen the
                    headlines, and they were taking a
                    chainsaw to our legs before they were
                    gonna kill us.

                    And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,
                    'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

                               SIMON
                    Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,
                    'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

                               NORMAN

                    So, Mallory calls 911 and they took
                    off.

                               SIMON

                    The couple proved so popular that a
                    motion picture glamorizing their
                    exploits was made...

     CUT TO: A POSTER for the Mickey and Mallory movie called 'Thrill
     Killers' is shown. It has a drawing of the Movie Mickey and
     Movie Mallory in a romantic pose a'la 'Gone With The Wind,' both
     with guns in their hands. Around them are smaller drawings of
     cars, people shooting, people fighting, explosions, etc.

     The adlines are: 'RIPPED FROM TODAY'S HEADLINES --THE TRUE STORY
     OF MICKEY AND MALLORY.' 'THE COUPLE THAT LIVED FOR LOVE AND
     LOVED TO KILL.'

     The poster lists the credits: 'Starring Jessie Alexander

                    We talked with Neil Pope, writer and
                    director of 'Thrill Killers' for his
                    take on the Mickey and Mallory
                    phenomena.

     Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets
     Wayne M.O.S.

     CUT INTO INTERVIEW:

                               NEIL POPE
                    It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox are a cultural phenomena that
                    could only exist in our sexually
                    repressed society. A flower that could
                    only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
                    culture. A what I tried to do with
                    'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of
                    the problem all the way down the vine
                    to the original bad seed. Yet amidst
                    the violence and murder and carnage,
                    you've got the structure of a Wagnerian
                    love story.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.
     The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,
     shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,
     where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up
     against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the
     subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, honey, listen to me.

     Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,
                    but--

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't run with you, Mickey! I really
                    want to. If I could, I would, but I
                    can't. I gotta stay here. But you can
                    still get out of here.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    If they stay, they'll catch you, and
                    they don't have to catch you---

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, you're wasting time!

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I don't give a damn if a million United
                    States marines, all whistling the halls
                    of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'
                    down this alley any second. There
                    ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm
                    leaving you. And that's that!

     Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

     The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, my love, if you leave me,
                    they'll catch me and take me to the
                    hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em
                    kill you. Then it'd be like I killed
                    you. I could bear anything, but I
                    couldn't bear that. So please, please,
                    for me, my handsome
                    husband, run for your life.

     The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I can't do it. You're my wife, you're
                    my partner. A fella doesn't run when
                    his partner can't run with him.
                    Mallory, my angel, if I could of left
                    ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

     They kiss.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me
                    a gun so I can go out shooting.

     Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little
                    tougher for 'em.

     Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the
     corner at the arriving COPS.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                         (to himself)
                    Time to get naked and boogie.

     Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,
     then places the barrel under her chin.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey!

     Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Yeah baby.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    You made every day like kindergarten.

     Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

     DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

     Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless
     body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

     Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Mallory!

     BACK TO: THE POPE INTERVIEW

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Why did you kill Mallory? Both of
                    them are still alive.

                               NEIL POPE
                    It was dramatic license, no doubt. But
                    I felt an operatic love story needed an
                    operatic ending. The two of them kill
                    for each other. They offer the death
                    of their victims to each other like
                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.
                    So what more natural, what more
                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory
                    offering her death to Mickey? It's
                    where it's been leading since day one.
                    We worked it in the movie by using a
                    what if they escaped situation. I
                    think it works beautifully. You'd be
                    surprised. People come up to me at the
                    end of the movie in tears.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks
     to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna
     is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.
     His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               JESSIE
                    One thing about Mickey for sure, he's
                    definitely a man who has his moments.
                    It was wild playin' him. It was one of
                    those get-it-out-of-your-system
                    performances.

     INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY

     This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.
     BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her
     lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name
     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               BUFFY
                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I
                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played
                    her as a woman in love, who also
                    happens to murder people. I didn't
                    want her to be at arm's length from the
                    audience or myself. If you play her as
                    this wild maniac, the audience never
                    has to deal with her. If you see a
                    decapitation in a movie, you just say
                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'
                    Because you can't relate to a
                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything
                    to anybody because it's not personal.
                    Decapitations don't fall into most
                    people's realm of life experiences.
                    But if you show somebody in a movie
                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience
                    squirms. Because everybody can relate
                    to a paper cut.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

                               BUFFY
                    I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.
                    But I read some letters she wrote to
                    Mickey before the murder spree. They
                    helped me out a lot.

                    Yeah, I visited him when he was up in
                    Susanville. He's a little cerebral for

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.
     REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    To get a psychiatric view on the
                    strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
                    seems to have, we talked with Doctor
                    Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and
                    author.

     Wayne begins his interview.

                               WAYNE
                    Can you shed some light, Doctor
                    Reinghold, on why the public has taken
                    a pair of sociopaths so close to their
                    bosom?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Well, for one, the media has done a
                    tremendous job of turning the husband
                    and wife mass murderers into
                    celebrities. But it's the country's
                    youth who have turned the couple into
                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
                    the very thing that makes them most
                    lethal is the exact same thing that
                    captures the public's hearts and
                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
                    devotion to each other. In a world
                    where people can't seem to make the
                    simplest relationships work and the
                    slightest emotional commitment is
                    considered devastating, Mick and
                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the
                    country's youth, 75 percent of which
                    are coming from broken homes, that's
                    appealing. They have an 'us against
                    the world' posture which always appeals
                    to youth. And they've taken that
                    posture seventeen steps beyond.
                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's
                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
                    exciting. I read their file and I find
                    myself turning the page like it was a
                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
                    disillusioned housewives read romance
                    novels? Why are you filming this
                    special? Because you know as well as I
                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to
                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey
                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb
                    with violence. They've created a world
                    where only two exist and anybody who
                    inadvertently enters that world is
                    murdered.

                    Of the six teens murdered that night,
                    seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was
                    the lucky one left to tell the tale.
                    And this haunted young lady summoned up
                    the courage to take the stand, tell
                    what she saw that horrible night, and
                    then allow herself to be cross-examined
                    by the man who killed her brother and
                    girlfriends.

     EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

     All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media
     event.

     Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators
     and reporters surround the car.

     Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start
     walking up the courthouse steps.

     Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask
     questions.

     Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the
     direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

     She remains silent and scared.

     Grace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the
     crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we
     hear the cry of:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mickey and Mallory!

     CAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying
     Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps
     they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit.

     Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by
     SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them
     and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their
     faces.

                    Well, he's my older brother. When we
                    were growing up, there were times we
                    could of very well done without each
                    other. But when it counted, we were
                    close.

                               MICKEY
                    I'd like to talk about Tim's martial
                    arts abilities. How long had he been
                    studying?

     PAN CONTINUES back into the shadows, then 180 degrees to find Grace.

                               GRACE
                    He started when he was in the seventh
                    grade, so that would make it nine
                    years.

                               MICKEY
                    When you study the martial arts, they
                    give out belts that come in different
                    colors to signify what level you're at
                    in your training. Am I correct on that
                    point?

                               GRACE
                    Yes you are.

                               MICKEY
                    What was the color of Tim's belt?

                               GRACE
                    The style of fighting that Tim studied
                    didn't believe in belts.

                               MICKEY
                    Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,
                    could you tell us what form of martial
                    arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

                               GRACE
                    Tim studied several styles, but his
                    favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

                               MICKEY
                    Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research
                    on that form of fighting, and I found
                    out that Jeet Kune Do was a style
                    developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know
                    that?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.
                    Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting
                    style.

     CU of COURT CLERK'S HANDS typing in SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, while I freely admit total
                    ignorance on the subject, I have heard
                    of Bruce Lee. And I was under the
                    impression that Bruce Lee was one of
                    the, if not the greatest fighter in the
                    history of martial arts.

                               GRACE
                    That's what Tim said.

                               MICKEY
                    So, I think it would be safe to say
                    that anybody who studied the fighting
                    style that Bruce Lee, arguably the
                    greatest martial artist of all times,
                    developed for nine years, that would be
                    a fella who could defend himself.
                    Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I would.

     Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand.

                               MICKEY
                    Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands
                    registered as lethal weapons?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, they were.

     CU of Mickey's hand holding the pencil.

                               MICKEY
                    That means his hands are considered a
                    weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I
                    correct on that point?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, you are.

                               MICKEY
                    Yet, in your testimony just now, you
                    described that Tim...

                    think you have a definite opinion on
                    how I was able to do those things you
                    described. Now, I'm going to ask you
                    again. And I want you to remember you
                    are under oath.

                    I able to murder you brother Tim

                    After the deadly brewhaha in the
                    courtroom, the judge, honorable Burt
                    Steinsma, passed down a sentence that
                    was to make legal history.

     INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

     Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home.

     M.O.S. SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at
                    his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

     The interview:

                               WAYNE
                    Was there any vengeance on your part
                    with your unique sentence?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Yes, unquestionably. After they did
                    what they did in my court, and judge
                    worth his robe will tell you the same
                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my
                    decision. That's why they have judges.
                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
                    but when it's showtime, we have to make
                    a decision. That's why we don't just
                    input all the facts into a computer for
                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
                    give them the death penalty. See,
                    California hops back and forth on that
                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
                    court when it was out of favor, which
                    is actually good because it leaves more
                    room for imagination. Anybody can give
                    somebody the chair. When you have
                    someone who deserves to die and you
                    can't kill them, you have to be
                    creative. And if the bastards had let
                    it stand, it would of been the perfect
                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they
                    lived. Far more punishing than the
                    death sentence.

                               WAYNE
                    Would you please describe for our
                    viewers what your sentence was?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,
                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day
                    and they're a very cold lot. They have
                    no more feelings about taking a
                    person's life than squashing a tiny
                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
                    to watch their expression change'
                    attitude personified. Except with each
                    other. And, since they lived only for
                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at
                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
                    sentence was double life for each
                    without any possibility for parole.
                    That would be fairly standard in their
                    case. The twist I added was that the
                    husband and wife would have no contact
                    or correspondence with each other for
                    the rest of their lives. And they
                    would never receive any word or
                    information about the other.
                    So, basically once the cell door slams
                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will
                    completely disappear from each other's
                    life. They'll never know when the
                    other dies. But alas, the best laid
                    plans of mice and men...

     The bus pulls out onto the street.

                    The sentence was never to reach that
                    point. Because after only a year,
                    Mickey and Mallory created so much
                    mayhem that it was decided...

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We talked with Dewight McClusky,
                    chairman of the California State Prison
                    Board, about this curious turn of
                    events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

     INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne's interviewing McClusky.

                               WAYNE
                    Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
                    to an asylum? And who made the
                    decision?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board made the decision. A
                    board of which I belong. We're the
                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and
                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully
                    they'll receive the help they need.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed
                    competent in a mental examination
                    before their trial. I'm confused.
                    What's changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, since that time, they've killed
                    one person during their trail. And
                    since their incarceration, they've
                    killed one psychologist along with
                    several guards and inmates.

                               WAYNE
                    When they were found competent before,
                    they had already killed fifty people.
                    Other than the fact they're a
                    disciplinary problem, which frankly
                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still
                    don't see where this situation is any
                    different then it was before. So, I
                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's
                    changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our
                    minds. We felt they were competent a
                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a
                    year where they were under close
                    observation, day in and day out, and
                    their behaviour has led us to believe we
                    were wrong.

                               WAYNE
                    Who is we?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board and the doctors who
                    examined them.

                               WAYNE
                    Were any of the doctors who made the
                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
                    state asked to re-examine them?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Using the same doctors is not common
                    practice.

                               WAYNE
                    I take it by your answer it was a whole
                    new team?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They
                    were different men. I hadn't really
                    thought that much about it. Since many
                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,
                    sought out for this kind of situation.
                    What do you think normally happens?
                    The Knoxs are assigned a family
                    psychologist that takes care of them
                    throughout the rest of their lives?
                    The state doesn't work like that.

                    good doctors, for whatever reason,

     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    It's a funny situation actually. If
                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
                    a damn, what the prison board is doing
                    would be considered an outrage. The
                    prison board is basically saying, 'We
                    can't handle these guys.' They've
                    moved 'em around twice since their
                    sentence started.
                    They were a handful everywhere they
                    went. Now the prisons they're at now
                    want them outta there. But no other
                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
                    'em. So the prison board is left
                    scratching their heads wondering what
                    they're gonna do. Well, what they
                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
                    medical court that found them crazy.
                    Then they get them transferred to
                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric
                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and
                    Mallory cease to be a problem to
                    anybody except the orderlies who clean
                    out the bedpans, which if you want to
                    see them get theirs, that's all well
                    and good. But there's something being
                    said here. Forget the immorality for a
                    second. Forget the corruption and the
                    skulduggery involved. What the board
                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and
                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.
                    They were put in an alternative society
                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the
                    powers that be, can't deal with these
                    two kids. And whatever can't be
                    assimilated has to be terminated.

                               WAYNE
                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
                    are not insane?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace
                    to living creatures, yes. But to
                    suggest that they're insane gives the
                    impression that they don't know right
                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know
                    the difference between right and wrong.
                    They just don't give a damn.

     Scott and Roger's shoulders.

                    Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'-
                    tastic! I think that interview stuff's
                    too long, we can lose some of that.
                    Keep the girls, keep the long hairs,
                    keep the Hun brothers, keep the black
                    guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the
                    cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest.
                    And cut the interview with the prison
                    board fellow before that. Cut it after
                    I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was
                    a whole new team.' Don't even let him
                    answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me
                    talking about the two chicken shit
                    psychiatrists and straight in Dr.
                    Reinghold laughing.

     INT. NEWS VAN - MOVING - DAY

     Through Scott's CAMERA, we're filming this in BLACK AND WHITE -
     16mm.

     NOTE: Everytime we're viewing through Scott's CAMERA, we are
     filming handheld in 16mm BLACK AND WHITE. Until otherwise
     specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

     Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the
     back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front
     driving.

                               WAYNE
                         (with mouthful of donut)
                    How's it working, Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Perfecto!

     Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to
     him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

                               ROGER
                    Where the fuck's the chocolate cream
                    filled? Did anyone get my chocolate
                    cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

     CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

                               ROGER
                    I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.
                    You saw me do it, didn't you?

     Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    You were there. Did you see him put it
                    in a box?

     We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

                               ROGER
                    At the time, I was too busy explaining
                    to Scott the finer points of film.

     We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Yeah, right. You know what he said?
                    He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple
                    Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

     Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

                               WAYNE
                         (to Roger)
                    You can't be serious?

                               ROGER
                         (preoccupied)
                    I'm as serious about that as I am about
                    going back to the donut store, and
                    dipping that stupid Mexican's head into
                    the batter for forgetting my chocolate
                    cream filled. Gimme that other box.

                               WAYNE
                    Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

                               ROGER
                    That dumbass probably put my chocolate
                    cream filled in there by mistake.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, no.

                               ROGER
                    What's the big deal? Take out my
                    chocolate cream filled, put one of
                    these roasted coconut---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, do you understand what the word
                    'no' means? It's important we
                    establish a rapport. Something as
                    simple as a dozen donuts can mean the
                    world to somebody who hasn't had a
                    donut in a year.

                               ROGER
                    So you're giving a man who butchers
                    whole families, little babies included,
                    my chocolate cream filled?

     Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the
     windshield.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County
                    Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

                               ROGER
                    Wayne---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.
                    Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and
                    gather your gear.

     The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent
     Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

                               WAYNE
                         (aside to Scott)
                    Here's the welcome wagon.

     Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

                               WURLITZER
                    Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.
                    We talked on the phone. It's a
                    pleasure to meet you.

                               WAYNE
                    Same here. Let me introduce my crew.
                    Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie
                    ...this is...I'm sorry. What's
                    your title again?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm the superintendent here at L.A.
                    County Jail. Me and my deputies are
                    who you'll be working with while you're
                    here.

                               WAYNE
                    That sounds great. Look, I don't want
                    any of this to intimidate you. This is
                    not going to be a big deal. This is
                    going to be very easy.
                         (to his crew)
                    I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You
                    guys get your equipment ready, power up
                    the van and confirm a transmission code
                    for the remote. Julie come with me.

     Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks
     confidentially to Wurlitzer.

                               WAYNE
                    The main thing I need is a big room,
                    shut off from the population, so we can
                    get some privacy...with a few
                    electrical outlets.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from
     the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect
     for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS
     around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his
     sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

     Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA
     moves from person to person without cutting.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to two Deputies)
                    This is just for an interview, I was
                    on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.
                    It was a much bigger deal than this.
                    They had a crew of maybe seventy-five
                    people.

     CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    We're gonna be talking over here. But
                    I want enough freedom so if I wanna get
                    up and move around, we can.

     Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

                               WAYNE
                    Take him and walk him over this way.
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,
                    what the hell was that all about?
                         (pauses--to Scott)
                    Then maybe take him to the window.

     He walks Scott to the window.

                               WAYNE
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail
                    today, what's the first thing you'd do?
                         (pause--to Scott)
                    Little shit like that. I don't wanna
                    have to feel I gotta stay in the
                    chairs. We're after a cinema verite,
                    anything can happen, truth twenty-four
                    times a second kindda feel.

     End of single SHOT.

     Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    And when it's lunch time, they don't
                    just go to McDonalds. They got cooks
                    there servin' great food. Swedish
                    meatballs...

     Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

                               WAYNE
                    Everything's coming along just fine.
                    Phil, I wanted to know if I could have
                    a small word with you.

                               WURLITZER
                    By all means.

     Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around
     the room.

                               WAYNE
                    You met the kids I have working for me?
                    Great bunch, aren't they?

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

                               WAYNE
                    Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,
                    magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I
                    could sooner do without my arm than
                    Unruly Julie.

                               WURLITZER
                    Is that her real name?

                               WAYNE
                    Just a little nickname. Yep, they're
                    my kids and they're all I need. After
                    working together these past coupla
                    years, we're like well-oiled machinery.
                    No, more like a Formula race car. No,
                    scratch that one, too. What we're
                    really like is a Swiss watch. Small,
                    intricate, compact...it shouldn't
                    work as well as it does, but it does.
                    Because of the craftsmanship, the
                    expertise, and the artist's loving
                    hand.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

                               WURLITZER
                    I see.

                               WAYNE
                    Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever
                    been on a set before---

                               WURLITZER
                         (proudly)
                    Ya know, I was.

                               WAYNE
                         (acting surprised)
                    Really?

                               WURLITZER
                    I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set
                    about eight years ago.

                               WAYNE
                         (still acting surprised)
                    Well...small world. Well, then, you
                    know firsthand how Hollywood does
                    things. Lights all over the place,
                    generators, a hundred and fifty crew
                    members---

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there
                    was probably ninety-five people there,
                    maybe more.

                               WAYNE
                    See what I mean? It's a funny
                    business, isn't it?

                               WURLITZER
                    It sure is.

                               WAYNE
                    They got a asshole over here.
                         (pointing to his left)
                    A asshole sitting down reading a
                    magazine over there.
                         (points to his right)
                    A asshole perched up there.
                         (points straight up)
                    Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we
                    were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang
                    stuff we'd need all those assholes,
                    too. What we're about is intimacy.
                    We're about two people having a
                    conversation. Say I was interviewing
                    you. All I want you to worry about is
                    what I ask you. I want a trust to
                    develop. If you're thinking about all
                    this...
                         (indicates the hustle and
                         bustle of a set)
                    ...you're not going to relax, a trust
                    won't develop, we'll be talking a each
                    other instead of to each other, there
                    will be no chance for intimacy.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

                               WAYNE
                    That's why my crew is only three...an
                    invisible three.
                         (switching gears)
                    Which brings me to what I wanted to
                    talk to you about. I have to get
                    Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to
                    share what he's never shared before...
                    Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till
                    today have been closed. Well, how can
                    we expect him to do that when we got
                    Los Angeles County Sheriffs up
                    the walls.

     Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                         (snorts)
                    Well, just what the hell do you expect
                    me to do?

                               WAYNE
                    Lose 'em.

                               WURLITZER
                    Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest
                    idea how dangerous Knox is?

                               WAYNE
                    Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very
                    familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

     They're out and out angry.

                               WURLITZER
                    Since he and his wife have been in
                    custody, they've killed---

                               WAYNE
                    Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure
                    I know 'em better than you do.

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, let me let you in on one more fact you
                    obviously don't know. If I were to
                    take my men away, Mickey Knox would
                    snap your neck like a twig.

                               WAYNE
                    One...I can take care of myself. I
                    grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and
                    I've handled some pretty rough
                    customers in my day. Mickey Knox
                    doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a
                    journalist, and I'm prepared to take
                    that risk. Three...it ain't gonna
                    happen. Believe me when I tell you, it
                    is in Mickey Knox's own best interest
                    to play this game according to Hoyle.
                         (pause)
                    Wait a minute. We've gotten into a
                    advisory relationship here, which is
                    not what I want.
                         (pause)
                    But seriously, Phil, look at this.

     Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.

                               WAYNE
                         (counting)
                    We got one...two...three...four
                    ...five...six...seven...eight.
                    I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too
                    much. Let's lose some of these guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne, if it was anybody else---

                               WAYNE
                    Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam
                    up on me with all these sheriffs all
                    over the place. They hate him. He
                    hates them. What kinda intimacy am I
                    gonna create with all this hate in the
                    air. Even you and I feel it.

                               WURLITZER
                    What are we talking about?

                               WAYNE
                    Two guys?

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay. I'll take two guys off.

                               WAYNE
                    No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two
                    guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    I can't do that. Five guys.

                               WAYNE
                    Three.

                               WURLITZER
                    I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but
                    that's it.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head.

     CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in
     the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open.
     The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and
     shackles.

                               DEPUTY #1
                    On your feet! Turn your face to the
                    wall.

     Mickey gets up.

                               MICKEY
                    Now what you're supposed to say is:
                    'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

     OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

     CU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell
     door makes her up with a jolt.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Rise and shine, Mallory!

     Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two
     deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and
     WASHINGTON.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and
     Washington's shiny black shoes.

     The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,
     along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,
     reverberates throughout the scene.

     Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding
     deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a
     cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long
                    and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

     Mallory looks straight ahead.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    See, I've been there twice. And I'm
                    not lookin' forward to goin' back. But
                    I'm in and out. You, on the other
                    hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the
                    rest of your life there. Now that's
                    what I call cruel and inhuman
                    punishment.

     Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Course you're not gonna give a shit.
                    'Cause when the good doctor's get
                    through givin' you the zap...
                         (he puts his finger next
                         to his temple, pantomimes
                         being electrocuted)
                    ...You won't know where the hell you
                    are. They'll just put you on a window
                    sill, and water you every other day.
                       
     Mallory lets out a big yawn.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly
     Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his
     entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally
     bursting into laughter.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    And when he gets here, its no dick'n
                    around time. Make him up, clip a mike
                    on him, then leave him alone. I don't
                    want you talking to him. I don't want
                    you getting in his face. I want you
                    hiding behind your gear. You are
                    invisible.

     CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the
     supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how
     he can still walk.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    Okay, break.

     Wayne's team disburses.

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

     Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others
     start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.

     Wayne approaches Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Wayne)
                    Okay now, before we get started here,
                    there's a few things we have to get
                    clear about.

                               WAYNE
                    All right, Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove
     the chains.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The
     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring
     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to
     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's
     wrists.

     Mallory's silent.

     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

                               BINGHAM
                    Turn around and face the wall!

     Mallory does.

     Bingham and Washington move to the door.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Wait outside for a second, fellas.

                               BINGHAM
                    We're not supposed---

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Don't worry about it.

     Bingham and Washington move outside.

     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before
     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back
     to him.

     Scagnetti walks up behind her.

     Mallory doesn't move.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Want a smoke?

     Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    C'mon, I already lit one for you. I
                    know you smoke.

     Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
     mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of
     Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I was reading the file on you. You
                    know what it said during your
                    trial, whenever they put you on the
                    stand, no matter what they asked, your
                    answer was always the same...'I love
                    Mickey.' It also says that when they
                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'
                    was the only thing you said that
                    registered as the truth.

     Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky
                    Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your
                    Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is
                    that the attraction? Or does he just
                    got a big dick?

     Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a
                    big donkey dick.

     Scagnetti presses closer.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is
                    close your eyes and remember...
                    remember the last time ol' Mickey gave
                    you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'
                    about it? Good. Remember it. Don't
                    ever forget it cause it ain't never
                    gonna happen again. Cause when they
                    get through with all that electroshock
                    shit they got lined up for you two,
                    Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

     Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.
     Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Look. You're gonna sit here for a
                    couple hours while I finish up the
                    arrangements. The reason they picked
                    me to be your chaperone is they know I
                    won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.
                     
     Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, during our journey, if any wild
                    hairs spring up on your ass, you'd
                    better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with
                    me, bitch, even a little bit, you're
                    gonna get accidentally shot!
                    Comprehende?

     Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD
     BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a
     horrible scream.

     EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell
     door.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti
     face down on the ground.

     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break
     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's
     screaming.

     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their
     shotguns.

     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,
     screaming.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    She broke my fucking nose! That bitch
                    broke my nose!

     Washington comes over to him and helps him up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (blood down his face)
                    She broke my nose.

                               WASHINGTON
                    I'll fix it.

     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.
     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down
     from the pain.

     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down
     from his face, looking over at Mallory.

     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun
     barrel placed in her mouth.

     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold her, boys.

     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun
     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on
     either side of her, holding her in place.

     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings
     it up to Mallory's face.

     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
     eyes, and all over her body.

     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on
     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They
     can't look at this anymore.

     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her
     all over her body.

     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the
     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can
     back to Washington.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I want this filled before we leave.

     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking
     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of
     excruciating pain.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a
     microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to
     Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    How come you never talk?

                               ROGER
                    She was born without a tongue.

                               MICKEY
                         (repulsed)
                    Oh my God!
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Sorry.

     Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and
     continues applying make-up.

     Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.

                               WAYNE
                    So we got a deal. Four deputies---

                               WURLITZER
                    And me.

                               WAYNE
                    Why don't we make it three deputies and
                    you?

                               WURLITZER
                    Why don't I have Mickey thrown back
                    into his cell and we can forget the
                    whole thing?

                               WAYNE
                    Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and
                    you, I can live with that. We're about
                    ready to go here, so let's get rid of
                    these other assholes.

                               WURLITZER
                    Don't call my men assholes.

                               WAYNE
                    I didn't mean they were assholes. I
                    mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta
                    here.

     Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up
     a light stand.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of
                    these assholes. Now I want to create
                    the illusion that this is just Mickey
                    and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.
                    So make sure you don't film these
                    assholes. I don't want to see 'em on
                    film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'
                    slated our spot as human interest which
                    means we'll go live at just after
                    five-thirty.

     Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G.

     Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    This asshole's tryin' to tell me what
                    I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!
                    This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's
                    dealin' with here, but we do. And if
                    shit happens, he ain't gonna be
                    responsible, we are. So keep your
                    shotguns out, your fingers on the
                    triggers, and be ready to fire at a
                    moment's notice.

     BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a
     donut. He takes a big bite.

                               ROGER
                    Say something.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    What?

                               ROGER
                    Anything.

     Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.

                               MICKEY
                         (talking in rhyme)
                    I stand amid the roar
                    Of a surf tormented shore,
                    As I hold within my hand
                    Grains of the golden sand--
                    How few! yet how they creep
                    Through my fingers to the deep,
                    While I weep--while I weep!
                    O God! can I not save
                    One from the pitiless wave?
                    Is all that we see or seem
                    But a dream within a dream?

     Mickey bites into the donut.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    How was that?

     Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.

                               ROGER
                    Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment
                    here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n
                    roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the
                    donut place put a chocolate cream
                    filled I asked for in your box.

                               MICKEY
                    There's a chocolate cream filled in
                    there?

                               ROGER
                    Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

                               MICKEY
                    Tough titty, it's mine now.

                               ROGER
                    Look, I'll trade you.

     Wayne enters frame.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!
                    What did I tell you. Stop bothering
                    Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

                               ROGER
                         (to himself)
                    Fine. Roger, what the hell are you
                    doing? You're bothering the serial
                    killer.

     Roger exits FRAME.

     Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Sorry about that.

                               MICKEY
                    Don't worry about it.

                               WAYNE
                    We're about ready to go here. Are you
                    ready?

                               MICKEY
                    Let's do it.

     Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay people! Let's start to settle
                    down here.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16mm - BLACK & WHITE

     SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of
     Mickey's eye.

     CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Are you comfortable?

     Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Roger?

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Rockin'!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Rollin'...and speed!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Slate it.

     CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into
     view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the
     FRAME.

                               WAYNE
                    So, Mickey, tell us what you do for
                    fun.

                               MICKEY
                    Aside from the obvious?

     Mickey breaks out laughing.

                               WAYNE
                         (not amused)
                    Yes. Aside from the obvious.

    Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, let me see now. What do I do for
                    fun?
                         (to people O.S.)
                    Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are
                    drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.
                         (to camera)
                    Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just
                    sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies
                    smokin' up a storm, and it's really
                    doin' it to me.

     A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights
     it. Deputy exits FRAME.

                               MICKEY
                    Much obliged. What do I do for fun?
                    Do you want to know what I do for fun
                    or what I did for fun?

                               WAYNE
                    What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun
                    for starters.

                               MICKEY
                    What I did for fun for starters.
                         (thinking)
                    Well, something I used to do...always
                    was a lot of fun...
                         (pause)
                    No, scratch that. Let me think of
                    something else. In fact, why don't we
                    come back to that question. Ask me
                    something else.

                               WAYNE
                    Do you miss Mallory?

                               MICKEY
                    Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my
                    wife. I haven't seen her in a long
                    time. What a stupid question.

                               WAYNE
                    Then was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was what worth it?

                               WAYNE
                    Was massacring all those people worth
                    being separated from your wife for the
                    rest of your life?

     Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you think up these questions or the
                    girl with no tongue?

                               WAYNE
                    No, Mickey, I can't let you get away
                    with that shit. Answer the question.
                    Was it worth it? You haven't seen,
                    heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.
                    Was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was an instant of purity worth a
                    lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

                               WAYNE
                    Excuse me, did you say an instant of
                    purity? What was the instant of
                    purity? The bodies you left behind on
                    your bloody trail?

                               MICKEY
                    That's only part of it. I mean, it's a
                    big, big, big part. But it's only the
                    chorus, it's not the whole song.

                               WAYNE
                         (passionately)
                    Please explain to me, Mickey, where's
                    the purity that you couldn't live
                    without in five year old Danny
                    Millhouse's blown off head? Where's
                    the purity in forty-eight people who
                    are no longer on this planet because
                    they met you and Mallory? What's so
                    fucking pure about that?

     CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes
     a slow drag off his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Where the purity comes into play---

     The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams.

     WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that
                    thought. Reload, quick!

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     We're back to COLOR 35mm.

     WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell.
     CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her
     face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to
     subside.

     All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Love is a hurtin' thang,
                    and it leaves a fiery sting.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Okay. Okay, we're up again.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Roll it. Save the slate.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16MM - BLACK & WHITE

     We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of
     film.

                               WAYNE
                    You just said an instant of purity was
                    preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't
                    understand. What's so pure about
                    forty-eight dead bodies?

                               MICKEY
                    You'll never understand. Me and you,
                    Wayne, we're not even the same species.
                    I used to be you...then I evolved.
                    From where you're standing, you're a
                    man. From where I'm standing, you're a
                    ape. I'm here...I'm right here...
                    and you...you're somewhere else, man.
                    You say why? I say why not?

                               WAYNE
                    Tell me about the purity.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughing)
                    It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and
                    a smoke only get you so far. You're
                    gonna have to do your job.

                               WAYNE
                         (laughs)
                    Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll
                    move on and come back later.

                               MICKEY
                    I'm sure we will.

                               WAYNE
                    Describe Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                    Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,
                    she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two
                    feet, two hands, ten fingers...

                               WAYNE
                    Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You
                    know what I mean. Describe Mallory.
                         (points at his head)
                    What's up here?
                         (points at his heart)
                    What's in here?

                               MICKEY
                    That's indescribable.

                               WAYNE
                    Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do
                    you feel about the fact that you're
                    never gonna see Mallory again?

                               MICKEY
                         (smiles)
                    Says who?

                               WAYNE
                    Says the United States of America.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughs)
                    When have they ever been right?

     The crew laughs (O.S.)

                               MICKEY
                    Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.
     His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.
     Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to
     Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't
     believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

                               MICKEY
                    ...one night I was asleep, and a noise
                    wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,
                    somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a
                    gun, so I go into the living room with
                    a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned
                    out to be nothing. God made the noise.
                    Who knows?

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (whispers)
                    How's it goin'?

                               WURLITZER
                         (whispers)
                    Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

     Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.

                               WURLITZER
                    What the hell happened to you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You should see the other bitch. What
                    time you got?

                               WURLITZER
                    Two-thirty. Shhh...

     CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of
     the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to
     Mickey's story.

                               MICKEY
                    But I came to the direction I need a
                    gun. Do, the next day I started off
                    early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a
                    gun shop and pick up a little home
                    protection. I walked into the place
                    and had never seen so many guns in all
                    my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the
                    this really nice sales guy comes up to
                    me. His name was Warren. I'll never
                    forget his name. He was really nice.
                    Anyway, Warren showed me all these
                    different models of guns. Magnums,
                    automatics, pistols, Walters. And I
                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a
                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon
                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew
                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.
                    It felt like it was a part of me. They
                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at
                    myself holding it, and looked so
                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.
                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
                    Turned my car around, drove to
                    Mallory's house, we took care of
                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,
                    and we were off.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     MEDIUM CU on Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The
                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,
                    they all missed the point of the story.
                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding
                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I
                    realized for the first time my one true
                    calling in life. I'm a natural born
                    killer.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, let's cut it.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

                               WAYNE
                         (to Scott)
                    Did ya get that?

     Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.

                               SCOTT
                    It's gonna be beautiful.

                               WAYNE
                    Super cool.
                         (to Mickey)
                    This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

                               MICKEY
                    I could go for a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm not running out and getting that
                    piece of shit a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                    Fine.
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Julie, why don't you make a food run?
                         (to the room)
                    What's around here?

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    There's an In and Out Burgers about a
                    block away on Olive. It's walking
                    distance.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.
                    I'll have a double double with cheese,
                    french fries, and a large Coke.

     Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then
     goes from person to person collecting their orders.

     Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

                               WURLITZER
                    Are you all set?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready
                    to roll.

                               WURLITZER
                    I assigned you Bingham and Washington
                    to go along.

     In B.G., Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah, we met. They're good men.

                               WURLITZER
                    They're real Goddamn good. They'll be
                    there for when ya need 'em. Where
                    are they?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Waitin' in the lounge.

                               WURLITZER
                    How 'bout Mallory?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

     Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In
     the B.G., we hear the wall phone BUZZ.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

                               WURLITZER
                    Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

     Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    Capt'n!

                               WURLITZER
                    Yeah?

     The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    They need you. Emergency!

     Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into phone)
                    Talk to me.
                         (pause)
                    Where?
                         (pause)
                    For the love of Pete...okay...okay
                    ...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on
                    my way.

     CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious
     eavesdroppers.

     CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,
     Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's
     conversation.

     OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a
                    riot going on in the laundry room.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Is it serious?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    It sure as hell is. They got guns,
                    hostages, and explosives.

     The room reacts.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Jack, could you stay up here for a
                    while?

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Yeah, sure.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'm taking one of these men. Yates,
                    come with me.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Could we go with you and film it?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Stay up here and finish your interview,
                    I've got to see what the hell's going
                    on down there before I can take
                    responsibility for you to film there.

     We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.

     Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her
     notebook.

                               MICKEY
                    I'll have a four by four. That's four
                    patty burgers. Now they don't have
                    that on the menu, but if you order a
                    four by four, they'll know what you're
                    talking about. A large Coke and two
                    orders of fries.

     When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off
     silently.

     CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

     As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the
     CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the
     DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall
     masques with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds
     of a riot swell until...

     A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a
     MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

     The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before
     moving on.

     CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling
     across the floor.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Sure.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty
                    funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now
                    in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.
                    And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks
                    her mother if she can go out on a date.

     As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's
     CAMERA follows.

                               MICKEY
                    The mother asks, 'Where's he taking
                    you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in
                    movie.' The mother tells her she can
                    only go if she takes Little Johnny with
                    her. She says okay. They go to the
                    drive-in, they come back. The mother
                    gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,
                    what happened? Where did ya go?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
     like he's driving.

                               MICKEY
                    Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What
                    did they do?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

                               MICKEY
                    'They kissed. What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.

                               MICKEY
                    'He felt her up? What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

                               MICKEY
                         (dumbfounded)
                    'They took off their clothes? What
                    else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.

                               MICKEY
                    'They did it? What were you doing?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking
     off.

     Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,
     even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

     As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4
     during the punchline.

     While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy
     #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from
     Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with
     the butt.

     Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

     Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     The other deputies react.

     Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in
     the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with
     a THUD.

     Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching
     position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

     Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

     The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him
     out of FRAME.

     Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --
     SLOW MOTION.

     CU of ceiling being BLASTED.

     Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.

     Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to
     fire -- SLOW MOTION.

     Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti --
     SLOW MOTION.

     Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.

     Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

     They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of
     the room.

     Nobody fires.

     We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on
     the ground, scared to death.

     CU on Scagnetti's face.

     CU on Mickey's face.

     CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then
     CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

     OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into
     a CU on his face.

                               MICKEY
                    Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Slide the shotgun over here, put your
                    hands behind your head, put your
                    forehead on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow
                    you in half and you know it.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I've never wounded anything in my life.
                    I got you locked right between the eyes.

     Mickey rises.

                               MICKEY
                    If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'
                    you in half on three. So, if you got
                    me locked, take the shot. One...

     DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in F.G., past the gun, to his face.

     CU of barrel of shotgun.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Two...

     DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.

     Wayne watches, wide eyed.

     ECU on Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                    Three!

     MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold it! Don't shoot!

     He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up.

                               MICKEY
                    Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

     Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.

     The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet -- SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Toss it.

     Scagnetti does.

                               MICKEY
                    Now put your hands behind your head.

     Scagnetti does.

     Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand,
     facing each other.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What?

     Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti
     hits the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.

     Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys stay on your bellies.

                               ROGER
                    Yes, sir.

     Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.

                               MICKEY
                    I am the most dangerous man in the
                    world.

     Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.

     Scagnetti screams.

     Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY
                         (points at Scagnetti)
                    You're the law.
                         (points at himself)
                    I'm the law breaker.

     Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.

     Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.

                               MICKEY
                    Donut, get your camera. See if it's
                    broke.

                               WAYNE
                    Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

                               MICKEY
                    Scott's dead. And unless you wanna
                    play follow the leader, shut up and do
                    as you're told.


     Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds
     like a lawn mower.

                               MICKEY
                    How is it?

                               ROGER
                    Not good.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you have a back up.

                               ROGER
                    It's video.

                               MICKEY
                    Even better. Wayne call your station,
                    tell 'em we're going live a little
                    early today. Make it happen!

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a
     TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only
     see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the
     FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us.

                               WURLITZER
                    I want two men stationed in that tier,
                    and I want men with rifles all along
                    the walkway.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Capt'n!

     Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the layout of the laundry room.

                               WURLITZER
                    Where do the air ducts lead?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Problem is they'll hear somebody
                    approaching that way.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    We turned off the power when they took
                    over the room.

                               WURLITZER
                    We turn it back on. The machines go
                    back on supplying us with the cover
                    noise we need. Smithy, do it.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Right away, Capt'n.

     CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    Yes.

                               WURLITZER
                    You sure?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    I think--

                               WURLITZER
                    Never say you think when you know, or
                    you know when you think.

     Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Bergman, you in place?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Pass this to your team...the second
                    they get a lock on a blue, they're to
                    take the shot. Do you understand?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks to his right.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you think, Pitney? How much
                    Explosives do you think that they
                    really have in there?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    It's hard to say Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Take a wild stab!

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

                               WURLITZER
                    The entire wing?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    That's my opinion.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jesus...

     Title Card recedes in FRAME to expose an active news room in the

     while adjusting his earphone.

                               CHAVEZ
                    Good afternoon, I'm Tony Chavez and
                    this is a KKTV Special Report. At this

                    This is Wayne Gayle reporting live from

                    can tell from the bloody carnage behind
                    me that the final chapter in the book
                    called Mickey and Mallory has not yet
                    been written.

     Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.

                               MICKEY
                    Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie
                    just underwent a title change. It's
                    now called 'The Escape of Mickey and

                    Okay, Donut, move in for a close up. I
                    want this for prosperity.

     CAMERA ZOOMS into a CU of Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin'
                    Mallory? I know she's still here, and
                    I know you know where. So, start
                    talking or my first work as a director

                    Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have
                    just tuned in, it appears that a
                    hostage situation involving Mickey Knox
                    is developing presently at the Los
                    Angeles County Jail. We have seen that
                    he is armed and apparently there has
                    been some loss of life. We will try to
                    re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle
                    and bring you more on this late

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

     WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and
     grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go
     of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it
     loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off
     the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

     Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and
     slips it into his pants.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.
                    Stand behind me, put your back against
                    mine and extend your arms behind you.

     Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against
     Mickey's.

                               MICKEY
                    Now if I feel your back move away from
                    mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
                    Got it?

     Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Wayne, step forward.

     Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus
                    against the barrel.

     Wayne does.

                               MICKEY
                    Grab his arms.

     Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with
     gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

                               MICKEY
                    Either one of you two move, it's gonna
                    be shotgun city. You understand?

                               WAYNE & SCAGNETTI
                    Yes.

     Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

                               MICKEY
                    You ready, Donut?

                               ROGER
                    Ready.

                               MICKEY
                    Wagons, hooaaa!

     The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with
     the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's
     walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to
     his neck.

     Roger follows with the camera.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to
     herself, and doing the hand motions.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha

                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha
                    dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing
                    there isn't much to it.
                    All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I
                    like the rest,
                    but the best part I like is
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo,
                    dodaleedo, do
                    quack, quack.

     The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey,
     Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up
     along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped
     with tape.

     CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Honey, I'm home.

     Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This
     kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something
     everybody told them they would never do again.

     For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're
     enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.

                               MALLORY
                         (in between kisses)
                    It's taken you so long to come to me.

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     A sheet of paper flashes through FRAME.

                               BAILEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the list of the rioters.

     CAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the
                    list of the hostages?

                               BAILEY (O.S.)
                    I'm working on it Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Keep on it, son.

     Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces.

                               WURLITZER
                         (reading the names)
                    Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez,
                    Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos,
                    Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard...

     Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with
     his hands.

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down.

                               WURLITZER
                    What is it Napalatoni?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    Mickey Knox is loose.

     Wurlitzer looks up.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you mean he's loose?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    He's armed, he's killed three deputies
                    and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the
                    moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox
                    in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,
                    another TV guy, that cop fella, and two
                    other deputies as hostages. And
                    Capt'n, they have one of them news
                    cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't
                    stop playin' it. What do you want us
                    to do?

     Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his
     mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing
     would come out. He just sits.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against
     the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly
     as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken
     fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is
     standing, alert and ready for action.

     As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,
     tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is
     panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man.

     Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, we're going out that door, and
                    we're gonna march down the hall and
                    right out of the building.
                         (to Wayne)
                    Donut said something about a news van.

                               WAYNE
                    Yeah, we have a van.

                               MICKEY
                    Where's it parked?

                               WAYNE
                    Out front.

                               MICKEY
                    Let me have the keys.

     Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses
     the keys to Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

                               MICKEY
                    No.

                               WAYNE
                    This is crazy. You can't escape like
                    this.

                               MICKEY
                    Probably not, but we're gonna give it
                    the old college try.

                               WAYNE
                    We'll all be killed.

                               MALLORY
                    Exciting, isn't it?

     Duncan begins to cry.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, when we get out there, you do what
                    we say or it's curtains. If we say
                    move, you move. If we say left, you
                    move left. If we say right, you move
                    right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.
                    Got it?

                               MALLORY
                    Are we in a big hurry?

                               MICKEY
                    You got something you want to do?

                               MALLORY
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    By all means, knock yourself out.

                               MALLORY
                    Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

     Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

     VIDEO FOOTAGE:

     Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she
     points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

                               MALLORY
                    You! Stand up!

     Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the
     wrong woman.

     Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

                               MALLORY
                    You probably thought it was pretty
                    funny, didn't ya?

     She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.
     Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

                               MALLORY
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked with me? Close your eyes and
                    remember...Are ya thinking about it?
                    Good.

     Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

     Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger
     HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

                               DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

                               MICKEY
                    We're sending out a hostage. Don't
                    touch him!

     OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

     Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory
     jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using
     the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell
     and...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

     There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

     CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the
     caravan.

     The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,
     real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

     The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,
     and gunfire.

     HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

     The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

     Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees
     this and screams.

                               MALLORY
                    Mickey!

                               MICKEY
                    Don't stop!

     Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Man, oh, man...this is better than
                    Vietnam!

     More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

     Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using
     DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.
     Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

                               DUNCAN
                    Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.
     The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

     Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
     control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

     CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls
     into FRAME screaming.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Get the camera! Get the fucking
                    camera!

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from
     Roger's side.

     The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last
     hostage.

     Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
     and silent.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    This way.

     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan
     the remaining hostage deputy.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Duncan)
                    Where does this lead?

     Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to
     wall.

                               MICKEY
                    Where!?!

                               DUNCAN
                    Th-- the ground floor.

                               MALLORY
                    Is that the front door?

     Duncan nods frantically.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's go.

     Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the
     stairs. They go down a few flights.

     As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team
     of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies
     raise their guns.

     Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand
     pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other
     are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

                               MALLORY
                    Back off or I'll blast him! Back off
                    or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll
                    blast him!

     None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
     likely to start shooting.

     Wayne screams.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!
                    Please, please, please...

     Wayne continues begging.

     Wurlitzer steps forward.

                               WURLITZER
                    Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

                               MALLORY
                    Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna
                    hear it!

                               WURLITZER
                    You have to know---

                               MALLORY
                    I said shut up...

     Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him
     in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

     Wayne's screaming in pain.

     The deputies jump back.

                               MALLORY
                    ...and I mean shut up!

     There's a bit of a silent standoff.

     Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly
     retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

     The deputies hold their present position.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory
     let their two hostages sit down.

     Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his
     uniform.

     Mickey's pacing.

                               MICKEY
                    Think...think...think...

     Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her
     hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's
     been shot.

     Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling
     from below.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Give up! There's no other way out!

     Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.
     him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

                               MALLORY
                    Look, lover boy, we're not getting
                    outta here. So I say the hell with
                    going back to our cells. Let's do a
                    Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
                    Run down these stairs shootin', go out
                    in a hail of bullets, but take as many
                    of those motherfuckers with us as
                    possible.

     Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

                               MICKEY
                    We'll do that when all else fails.

     Mickey stands.

                               MALLORY
                    Hasn't it?

                               MICKEY
                    We still got a few tricks up our
                    sleeves.

     Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You married?

                               DUNCAN
                    Oh, I don't wanna die...

                               MICKEY
                    Are you married? Do you have kids?

     Duncan nods pathetically.

                               MICKEY
                    Good. People, we're goin' all the way
                    to the front door. Now, the only way
                    we're gonna get there is if they don't
                    want to kill you two more than they
                    want to kill us.

     INSERT:

     SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill
     Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Right now I find that highly unlikely.
                    So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

     BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:

     Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, say I tell those guys down there
                    if they shoot or make a move, I'm
                    killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or
                    make a move anyway. Now say by some
                    freak accident, you didn't die, you
                    live though it. What would you do?

     Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts
     tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    What would I do? Me and my network
                    would sue the entire Los Angeles County
                    Sheriffs Department for flagrantly
                    disregarding my safety. I'd go
                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and
                    make sure everyone of those son of a
                    bitches down there ends up on the
                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue
                    every man down there personally. I
                    would make it my life's ambition to
                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.
                    I would do expose after expose on the
                    brutality, and the conditions, and the
                    inhumanity that exists here.

     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.
     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
     around the barrel of his shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    That's what I thought. You tell them
                    that. When we go down those stairs, I
                    want you to scream what you just told
                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the
                    star of American Maniacs watched every
                    week by'-- how many people?

                               WAYNE
                    On average forty million.

                               MICKEY
                    'Every week by forty million people. I
                    am a respected journalist.' Have you
                    won any awards?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The
                    Edward R. Murrow award...

                               MICKEY
                    'Respected journalist'-- On your
                    knees...

     Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props
     his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the
     barrel around his neck.

                               MICKEY
                         (continues)
                    ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the
                    Edward R. Murrow award among others.'
                    Tell 'em the name of your personal
                    lawyer, his firm, his address, and
                    phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor
                    and the unemployment lines. You
                    getting the idea?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

     Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the
     stock of the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Say it. Scream it. All the way out
                    the front door and into your van. And
                    if you stop screaming, I swear to God
                    I'll blow your head off.

                               WAYNE
                    Got it.

     Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before
     shouting to Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You! What's your name?

     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory
     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before
     reading his name badge.

                               MALLORY
                    Duncan...Homolka?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

     Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when
     they hear:

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Start.

     Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

     The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they
     take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would
     die.

     Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
     shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in
     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he
     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE
     and COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA
     on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be
     spared.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star
                    of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty
                    million people every week! I am a
                    respected journalist, winners of the
                    Golden Globe, the Edward R.
                    Murrows Award among others! If anybody
                    puts me in danger, my network will sue
                    The Los Angeles County Sheriffs
                    Department. My estate will sue every
                    officer personally who fires. The
                    network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis
                    and Sinclair...

     Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the
     deputies.

                               MALLORY
                         (yelling)
                    Make a path!

     The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

     The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne
     yelling all the way.

     The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they
     keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front
     lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

     Wurlitzer stands his ground.

                               WURLITZER
                    How far do you think your gonna get?

                               MICKEY
                    Right out the front door.

                               WURLITZER
                    That'll never happen.

                               MICKEY
                    It is happening.

     The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep
     their weapons ready.

     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

                               MALLORY
                    Don't stop!

     Wayne starts up again.

     The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer
     are nose to nose.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Mickey)
                    I will personally hunt you down, blow
                    the head off your fucking-whore-wife,
                    and plant your sick ass in the ground
                    all by myself.

                               MICKEY
                         (calmly)
                    Another day perhaps, but not today.

     Mickey leaves FRAME.

                                                    CUT TO:

     EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,
     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open
     air.

     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while
     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE
     LEADER.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &
     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being
     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a
     fence post.

     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not
     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly
     into the CAMERA.

                               WAYNE
                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and
                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are
                    shooting with a wild camera and a
                    standard recorder we found in the van.
                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked
                    out the front door, into my news van
                    and made our getaway. When we were
                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox
                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
                    and tossed his body out of the back.
                    Mickey told authorities over my police
                    band that I would surely be next if
                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They
                    took Mickey at his word and called off
                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
                    employed, I don't know. My only
                    thought is it all happened too fast for
                    arrangements to be made. We've just
                    pulled off to the side of the road to
                    do this interview. Tensions run high--

     Mickey screams O.S.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!

                               WAYNE
                    Without any further ado, Mickey and
                    Mallory...

     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting
     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces
     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's
                    plan? Did you think it would work?

                               MALLORY
                    It wasn't 'till we got on the ground
                    floor that I totally realized they
                    weren't gonna shoot unless we shot
                    first. When we got out of the
                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my
                    God. This might work.' But
                    Mickey knew it would work all along.
                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.
                    It's not like there was and he just
                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    What did you think then?

                               MALLORY
                    I wondered how long it would be before
                    we'd get to be alone together. And I
                    wondered if I could wait that long.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you have anything to do with the
                    riot in the laundry room?

                               MALLORY
                    Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'
                    word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can
                    I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Try to keep it to a minimum.

                               MALLORY
                    We had nothing to do with that riot.
                    That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

     Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

                              MICKEY
                    Divine intervention.

                               MALLORY
                    What he said. We didn't know jack shit
                    about and riot. It just happened. It
                    was kismet. We didn't even know those
                    people. How are we supposed to
                    organize a riot when we've been in
                    fuckin' isolation for the past year?
                    Just bleep out the fucks and jack
                    shits.
                         (laughs)
                    I mean, it's not like we care. If they
                    wanna say we masterminded the whole
                    thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep
                    us up at night. But you said you
                    wanted the truth, and the truth is we
                    were just lucky.

     Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

                               MICKEY
                    C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    So, what now?

                               MALLORY
                    Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take
                    it easy. Just enjoy each other's
                    company, stop and smell the roses,
                    notice the color purple, stuff like
                    that.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    How do you intend to disappear? you're
                    probably the most famous couple in
                    America.

                               MALLORY
                    Well, back in slave times they had a
                    thing called the underground railroad.
                    And we got a whole fan club out there
                    just waiting to be conductors.
                         (to the camera)
                    So, you kids out there, keep the faith.
                    Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'
                    to your town real soon.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, that's enough. End of interview.
                    We gotta move.

     Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
     lowers it from his eye.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay, just let me swing around and film
                    myself asking the questions. And then
                    I'll do my little wrap up.

     Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
     balances it on a fence post.

                               MICKEY
                    Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,
                    all right. But it won't be you starin'
                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting
                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be
                    starin' down the barrels of our
                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the
                    triggers.

     Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into
     a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    That's a joke right?

     Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her
     shotgun from off the ground.

                               WAYNE
                    Just wait one fucking minute.

                               MICKEY
                    I said I'd give you a interview. Now
                    unless I'm mistaken, we just did a
                    interview.
                         (to Mallory)
                    We did an interview, didn't we?

                               MALLORY
                    Looked like an interview to me.

                               MICKEY
                    I said we'd give you an interview. I
                    never said we wouldn't kill you.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt
                    during this...this whole escape that
                    a kind of bond--

     Wayne is shaking.

                               WAYNE
                         (continues)
                    ...developed between the three of
                    us. We're kindda in this together,
                    don't ya think?

                               MICKEY
                    No. Not really.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't touch those triggers! Please. I
                    think I've already proven that a live
                    Wayne Gayle is much more better that a
                    dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your
                    passport out of jail, not Duncan
                    Homolka. But me! I'll be your
                    passport outta---

                               MICKEY
                    Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate
                    you. If anybody in the fuckin' world
                    deserves to die, it's you.

     Wayne is grasping for anything.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and
                    Mallory always leave somebody alive to
                    tell the tale.

                               MICKEY
                    We are.
                         (points to camera)
                    Your camera.

     Mickey turns to Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                         (John Wayne voice)
                    Let's make a little music, Colorada.

                               WAYNE
                    NO!!!

     The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,
     who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

     Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing
     into the news van, they drive away.

     Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA
     eventually runs out of film.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back
     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We
     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF
     SCREEN.

     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

                               MICKEY
                    What kind of pies do you have?

                               MABEL
                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

                               MICKEY
                    Which do you recommend?

                               MABEL
                    The key lime is great, but it's
                    an acquired taste.

                               MICKEY
                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten
                    years.

                               MABEL
                    When ya had it, did ya like it?

                               MICKEY
                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a
                    completely different person ten years
                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in
                    court. And a large glass of milk.

     Mabel turns to her right.
 
                               MABEL
                         (to someone O.S.)
                    Should I make that two pieces?

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back
     is to the camera as well.

                               MALLORY
                    Nada, Rosey.

                               MABEL
                         (annoyed)
                    My name's not Rosey.
                         (points at name tag)
                    It's Mabel.

     Mabel exits FRAME.

                               MALLORY
                    Whatever.

     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next
     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,
     she selects a quarter.

                               MABEL
                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're
                    doin'?

     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes
     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
     shop.

     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

                               MABEL
                         (to Mickey)
                    She ought not be doing that. That's
                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time
     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

                               MICKEY
                    I can't take her anywhere.

     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
     hell these people are.

     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his
     pie and milk.

     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls
     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three
     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the
     pickup's hood.

                               EARL
                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.
                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er
                    out.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of
     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

                               SONNY
                    Good God almighty. What the hell is
                    that?

                               OTIS
                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.

     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

                               SONNY
                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next
     to Mickey.

                               SONNY
                    Miller, Mabel.

                               MABEL
                    Comin' up.

     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
     him.

     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a
     swig, enjoying the floor show.

                               SONNY
                         (to Mickey)
                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't
                    it?

     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression
     betrays nothing.

                               MICKEY
                    Her name's Mallory.

     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

                               OTIS
                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.
                    I'm just getting warmed up.

     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
     Sonny.

     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

                               SONNY
                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
     spinning him around.

     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the
     table, cracking the linoleum.

     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches
     hold of his shoulder.

     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points
     his finger at him, threateningly.

     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.
     Blood flows from the wound.

                               MICKEY
                    Just because my woman's mopping up the
                    floor with your buddy is no reason for
                    you to join in.

     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck
     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be
     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices
     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,
     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
     his jacket and FIRES.

     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It
     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
     the ground, screaming.

     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass
     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the
     ground dead.

     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING
     his head repeatedly on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Honey.

     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to
     Mickey's side.

     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
     pot, crying.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Pick one.

     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

                               MALLORY
                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a
                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let
                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My
                    mom told me to pick the best one and
                    you are it.

     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

                               MABEL
                    NO!

     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She
     hits the floor dead.

     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

                               MALLORY
                    When you tell people what went on here,
                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did
                    this. Understand?

     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.
     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

     Over black screen, we hear:

                    Send Scagnetti in here.

     INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY

     CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in
     the middle of the frame.

     JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's
     office. Squeri's never seen.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room
                    C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the
                    prison board, is waiting to meet you.
                    You're gonna deliver two prisoners from
                    the county jail to Nystrom Insane
                    Asylum in Bakersfield.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    This is bullshit. I'm a detective.
                    You want an errand boy, call Jerry
                    Lewis.

     Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door
     shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

                               CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
                    Jack!

     INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

     Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,
     wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

     PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already
     tied tie over his head.

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY

     DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,
     stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.
     In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

     McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,
                    Scagnetti. You put an end to a
                    nightmare. The ladies of this city can
                    get to sleep again, and they have you
                    to thank.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thank you, sir.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Dewight McClusky of the California
                    Prison Board. Take a seat please.

     Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation
     table.

                               MCCLUSKY
                         (referring to book)
                    This is damn good reading. I'm
                    surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.
                    This would make a better movie than
                    that 'Serpico' shit.

     McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The
     Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.
     McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He
     lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    I think you'll find that good reading
                    as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.
                    You familiar with them?

     Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs
     of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who isn't?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You been followin' the news coverage?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've been separated since their
                    incarceration in a couple of
                    penitentiaries---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Susanville, Soledade.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    They've killed a shitload of inmates
                    and guards---

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Five inmates, eight guards and one
                    psychiatrist all in one year's time...
                    Very good. You do keep up with the
                    headlines.

     Scagnetti nods.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Look, our situation in a nutshell is,
                    no prison wants 'em, no prison will
                    take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,
                    where the warden's as hard as a bar of
                    iron. No one wants those fuckin'
                    assholes behind their walls, dealin'
                    with 'em day in, day out.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I can appreciate that.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    So can we. So the solution to our
                    little problem is we had them deemed
                    crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to
                    Nystrom Asylum for the criminally
                    insane.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Lobotomy Bay?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You've heard of it?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, how do I fit into this scheme?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The public loves you Jack...You don't
                    mind if I call you Jack, do you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    By all means.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six
                    years on the force, a best-seller out on
                    paperback...

     McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent
                    lawman with a deadly axe to grind with
                    maniacs.

     McClusky lowers the book.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You're a breathing icon of justice and
                    that's why you were chosen to deliver
                    Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison
                    board we, knows that once you get them
                    on the road if anything should happen,
                    an escape attempt, an accident, fire,
                    anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti
                    would be there to look out for his
                    public's best interests.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I see.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    You write the script Jack, call it,
                    'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination
                    of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...
                    Have we found our man?

     Hold on Scagnetti.

                                                  CUT TO:

     INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY

     SCAGNETTI'S POV: McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He
     BANGS on it with is fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through
     this scene.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through
                    with a visitor!

     A BUZZER SOUNDS

     McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As
     soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the
     song 'Long Time Woman'.

     McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my
                    years with the penal institution, and
                    I'll tell ya that's no small number,
                    Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a
                    doubt the most twisted, depraved group
                    of fucks it's ever been my displeasure
                    to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two
                    rat shits are a walkin' reminder of
                    just how fucked up our system really
                    is.

     The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Who's the song bird?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Mickey's better half herself. Mallory
                    Knox. This little lady drowned her
                    father in a fish tank.

     INSERT: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CU of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly
     Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

                               MCCLUSKY
                    While the two together burned her
                    mother alive in her bed.

     INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MEDIUM CU of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open.
     What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME,
     pouring gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags.
     CAMERA PANS up and we see Mickey holding a gas can.

     CU of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in
     front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.

     BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV:

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Why?

     McClusky's still walking ahead of us.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Because they wouldn't give them their
                    blessing for marriage.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Ain't love grand.

     McClusky laughs.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

     Still SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's
     file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color
     of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that
     is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

     As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

                               FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)
                    When pressed about the reason for the
                    murders...patient became hostile...

     INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine
     dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly
     at the CAMERA.

                               MALLORY
                    I don't owe you an explanation! I don't
                    owe you shit! I'm not here for your
                    entertainment. If I don't tell you
                    what you wanna hear, what are you gonna
                    do? Throw me in jail? I'm already
                    there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna
                    give me some more time? I've already
                    got life. What else you got to
                    threaten me with? Death? I'd like to
                    see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one
                    motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

     BACK TO DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:

     Still on SCAGNETTI'S POV:

     We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a
     cell door.

     We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell.

     We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures
     toward the cell.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Here she is...you know her, you
                    love her, you can't live without
                    her...Mallory Knox.

     We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see
     Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing.

     INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY

     CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    99 years is a long, long time. Look at
                    me, I will never be free, I'm a long time
                    woman...

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to
                    meet you.

     Mallory just keeps on truckin'.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Been workin' on the road now.
                    Been workin' by the sea.
                    Been workin' in the cane fields.
                    and I wanna be free...

     MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second.
     Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory
     screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV
     flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

     MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

     CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Jesus Christ!

     CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Don't worry about it. She does that
                    all the time.

     BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood
     trickling down her scalp.

                               MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
                    Follow me.

     INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY

     CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti
     approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.

     PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                    You duckin' me Dewight?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    This son of a bitch is chairman of the
                    prison board, but it's like pullin'
                    teeth to get him down to a prison.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The only reason I'm here now is to set
                    him straight, and I'm on the next
                    flight out.
                         (to Scagnetti)
                    Jack, this is the superintendent of the
                    jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man
                    who's got the power of the pen here.

     Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

                               WURLITZER
                    Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your
                    book. I'm impressed. Good work on
                    Curtis Fox.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Thanks.

                               MCCLUSKY
                    From now on, you'll be dealin' with
                    Phil. He can answer all the questions
                    you got about the arrangements. I'm
                    gonna be bidding you good luck and
                    adieu in about twenty minutes. My
                    flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in
                    a hour.

                               WURLITZER
                    And I want you to know, we'll all cry a
                    river when you're gone.

     They all laugh.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What's the travelling arrangements?

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be
                    together. So, we'll put you on one of
                    our prison busses and you'll take
                    Mallory first, then you'll come back
                    for Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    And where do you keep Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,
                    darkest cell in the whole place. But
                    it just so happens that right now he's
                    got a special visitor.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who?

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne Gayle.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (surprised)
                    Wayne Gayle!

     INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la
     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.
     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a
     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

                               WAYNE
                         (into recorder)
                    Testing one...two...three...
                    testing...one...three...over,
                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It
     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the
     recorder in his sport coat jacket.

     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
     and feet are double cuffed.

     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
     intimidating, and fascinating figure.

     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                         (to himself)
                    Showtime.

     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of
     the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by
     the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello Mickey. We've never been
                    introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I
                    don't know if you've ever heard of me
                    or remember me. I was one of the
                    reporters outside the courthouse during
                    your trial---

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody knows who you are. You're
                    famous.

     Wayne pauses and retorts.

                               WAYNE
                    I could say the same thing about you.
                         (smiles)
                    I want to thank you very much for
                    seeing me...

     Mickey is silent.

                               WAYNE
                    I have a television show. It's very
                    popular. Every week we do a profile on
                    a different serial killer. You don't
                    mind if I call you a serial killer, do
                    you?

     Mickey shakes his head no.

                               WAYNE
                    The episode we did on Mickey and
                    Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

                               MICKEY
                    Whose ratings were higher?

                               WAYNE
                    Yours.

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on
                    him?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

                               MICKEY
                    Good...yuppie piece of shit.

                               WAYNE
                    What I'd like to do---

                               MICKEY
                    How 'bout Manson?

                               WAYNE
                    Manson beat you.

                               MICKEY
                    Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the
                    king.

                               WAYNE
                    We've been waiting to do a follow up
                    episode on you for a long time. And
                    that time has definitely come.
                         (pause)
                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
                    hip to what's going on that the prison
                    board has thrown the constitution
                    straight out the fuckin' window.
                    You and Mallory may be killers, but
                    you're not insane. You belong in a
                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison
                    board is blatantly railroading you into
                    a hospital for the sole purpose of
                    turning you into vegetables. Now some
                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
                    one of those people. If we avert our
                    eyes while they do this to you, we give
                    them permission to do it again whenever
                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean
                    your mind because they feel your
                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
                    wipe clean my mind because they feel
                    what I say is dangerous. Where does
                    it all stop?

     No response from Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't
                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
                    on this. I need your help. I want
                    what the prison board is doing to be
                    the focus of our follow up episode.
                    Now I have interviews with chairman of
                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about
                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two
                    psychologists they used for their
                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
                    to us, which always looks bad. I have
                    an interview with both the judge of
                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
                    psychologist and author, Emil
                    Reinghold, both of which discount the
                    notion that you're insane. You put
                    that all together, and what the state
                    is doing becomes obvious. But the
                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the
                    show needs another element. It needs
                    you. In order to put the show on the
                    air, I need to get an interview with
                    you. You haven't talked to the press
                    since your trial. Now, a few days
                    before you get transferred to an
                    asylum, you grant an interview on
                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're
                    talkin' a media event here. Every son
                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's
                    gonna tune in to see that.
                    We'll make their motives so blatant,
                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
                    thing. At least for a little while,
                    the publicity would keep them from just
                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
                    Well, whatta ya say?

                               MICKEY
                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?

                               WAYNE
                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now
                    you're not supposed to know anything
                    about what's going on with her, but I'm
                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you
                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't
                    spoken one word.

                               MICKEY
                    She doesn't talk?

                               WAYNE
                    Not to anybody. She sings.

                               MICKEY
                    She sings? What does she sing?

                               WAYNE
                    Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The
                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty
                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be
                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.
                    Her behaviour was the main thing the
                    doctors' report used against you. So
                    even if she would see me, which she
                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera
                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are
                    you insane?' And she starts singing
                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',
                    that blows our whole case.

     Mickey cracks a smile.

     The guards come over to take him away.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Time, motherfucker!

     They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an
                    answer.

     Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

                               WAYNE
                         (yells after him)
                    Just think about it. But don't think
                    too long.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a
     letter.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.
                    At night I get the chills. I pretend
                    you're lying next to me, holding me
                    from behind with your leg draped over
                    mine and your arms wrapped tightly
                    around me. I lie in my cell...

     DISSOLVE TO:

     WIDE SHOT in cell behind Mickey. We slowly DOLLY back.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    ...and imagine kissing you. Not
                    making love, just kissing for hours and
                    hours on end. I remember everything
                    about our time. I remember every joke
                    you ever told.

     CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    I remember every secret you ever
                    shared. Shared or revealed? I think
                    shared is proper. I remember every
                    single time you laughed.

     ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear
     Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember every meal we ever ate. I
                    remember your cooking. I especially
                    remember your casseroles. I remember
                    watching David Letterman.

     We hear the echo of television laughter.

                               MICKEY
                    I remember driving fast...faster,
                    man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe
                    de Ville.

     The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

                                                  CUT TO:

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory,
     driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through
     their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around
     Mickey and kisses.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet
                    up on the dash, singing along with the
                    radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A
                    Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of
                    Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary
                    Goes', 'Groove Me'...

     EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

     Coupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the
     drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on
     the hood of the car.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    And your dancing, my God, your dancing.
                    I lie on my bed and go over every day,
                    every minute of our happiness. Every
                    day take a day of our time and go
                    through it hour by hour. I don't jump
                    ahead either. I take it as it comes,
                    and I live that day again. That way
                    when I get to our first kiss...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear
     in the flame kissing passionately.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    The killing of your parents, our
                    wedding...They're not just memories.
                    I feel that joy again...

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face
     and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over
     Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

                               WAYNE
                         (reading out loud)
                    'After taking a few days to reflect on
                    your offer, I've come to the conclusion
                    that you are one hundred percent
                    correct. A national TV interview would
                    be very advantageous to both Mallory
                    and I. The only obstacle is they're
                    shipping me out to the funny farm in
                    four days. However, that is your
                    problem and not mine. I feel confident
                    you'll manage. Here's to us making
                    television history. Sincerely, Mickey
                    Knox.'

     Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

                               WAYNE
                    Am I a God or what?

     We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's
     decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
     remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they
     all pretend they are praying to him.

     The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild
     t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On
     Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears
     wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,
     Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a
     baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
     weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his
     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie
     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are
     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's
     stylish yuppie demeanour.

     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold
     out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks
     straight from the bottle.

     NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl
     Friday' pace.

                               WAYNE
                    Drink up! This is a celebration. This
                    is the day we received word we were
                    gonna make television history. We're
                    gonna have the first sit down, in depth
                    interview with the most charismatic
                    serial killer ever, one day before he's
                    being shipped to a mental hospital for
                    the rest of his life. This is one of
                    those golden moments that happens maybe
                    only four times in a lucky journalist's
                    career. This is Wallace with Noriega,
                    this is Elton John confessing his
                    bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this
                    is the tearful reporting of the
                    Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut
                    setting the record straight on
                    Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,
                    this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting
                    Deep Throat in an underground parking
                    lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The
                    Ten Days That Shook The World', this is
                    the hippies' bloody palms at Kent
                    State, the Maysles brothers at
                    Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost
                    interviews...

                               ROGER
                    This is Raymond Burr witnessing the
                    destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

     Everybody laughs.

                               SCOTT
                    What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

     As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.
     She never speaks, just writes.

                               WAYNE
                    We got tonight and tomorrow to get our
                    shit together. The day after that
                    they're shippin' Mallory. That's when
                    we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause
                    the next day he goes.

                               SCOTT
                    Would the network really not run it
                    without the interview?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The last thing they
                    expected was Mickey Knox to get up
                    close and personal. They wanted a
                    follow up episode and would've taken
                    anything I had given them. I'm not
                    gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna
                    make him think his grey matter depends
                    on it. When I told Woody and the brass
                    about this coup, they practically shit
                    a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.
                    They want to expand the show to a hour,
                    and they want it on immediately.

                               ROGER
                    How immediate is immediately?

                               WAYNE
                    Next week's episode.

     Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.

                    We don't got enough footage for a hour

                               WAYNE
                    Rape and pillage the first episode,
                    just change the order a bit. Those
                    sons of bitches out there ain't gonna
                    know the difference. All that shit is
                    just filler for the interview anyway.
                    We film a new intro. Show some old
                    footage from the first episode so the
                    get a brief history of Mickey and
                    Mallory. We introduce a new angle...
                    what the prison board is up to. We
                    see some of that new shit, then the
                    rest of the show is the interview. Now
                    what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,
                    Julie make a note: I need Woody to get
                    me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'
                    broadcast to promote next weeks show.
                    We'll do a feed right from the jail
                    while we're wrapping up with Mickey.

     Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    You too Scott, Betacam and a remote,
                    keep it simple.

     Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.

                               SCOTT
                    Betacam with remote and two-way comm
                    link. Got it.
                         (opens eyes)
                    How about the interview...What camera
                    do you want to use?

     Wayne closes his eyes.
 
                               WAYNE
                    I see...high contrast sixteen
                    millimetre black and white, and I mean
                    black and white, where the black's
                    black and the white's white. This is
                    for posterity, so fuck video. Film!
                    Film! Film!

                    So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and
                    planning the interview.
                         (points at Roger & Scott)
                    You two go down to the editing bay,
                    take the old footage and the new
                    footage, put it together, and see what
                    we got. Get it into shape so when we
                    finish the interview, we can just stick
                    it in.

     CAMERA leads Wayne, who's talking to Unruly Julie. As they
     march quickly through the halls Julie writes furiously in her
     notebook.

                               WAYNE
                    At that point I'll ask him if he
                    believes in God. If he says yes, I'll
                    ask him what he thinks God would make
                    of his actions. And is he worried
                    about burning in hell? If he says no,
                    I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you
                    believe in?' And hopefully he'll say
                    something like a live round of ammo,
                    the expression on the face of a man he
                    just split up the middle, Mallory's
                    eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.
                    He's bound to say something
                    provocative.

     Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and
     Roger are sitting at the editing bay. Everybody is wearing, and
     looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before,
     except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, boys, let's have it.

                               SCOTT
                    Well, basically, what we did was put
                    part of the old show on first...

                               ROGER
                    But we changed the order around so it
                    wasn't super obvious...

                               SCOTT
                    Then we added the new shit to the
                    tail...

                               ROGER
                    So we film the interview, and we can
                    just slap it on at the end.

     Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, let's see it.

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Now we got to film a new intro for the
                    follow up episode. But we put the
                    intro for the first episode at the
                    beginning temporarily so you can see it
                    with some scope.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     WAYNE GAYLE is standing in the middle of an empty highway. The
     CAMERA looks up from the ground. With a WIDE ANGLE lens, he
     looks practically mythic.

     Wayne speaks into the camera.

                               WAYNE
                    Hello. Welcome to 'American Maniacs'.
                    I'm your host Wayne Gayle. And this is
                    Highway 58.

     Wayne walks toward the CAMERA. We DOLLY back.

                    point A and point B. To others a
                    beautiful stretch to the American
                    landscape. But to Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox, it was a candy land of murder and
                    mayhem.

     While we hear Wayne's narration, we see a MONTAGE of home 8mm
     movie footage. These are films of Mickey and Mallory living a
     normal life.

     In front of the store three windbreaker cops have Mickey on the
     ground, beating him with nightsticks. One COP lies on the
     ground near them, holding his hands over his face, screaming.

     To the left Mallory is slugging it out with a windbreaker COP,
     matching each other blow for blow.

     Meanwhile, the three cops we ran with reach the action and join
     in.

                    Mickey and Mallory's idea of an armed
                    robbery was a little different than
                    most. It was an assault, actually.

                    Well. I knew that Mickey and Mallory
                    kill everybody when they're through,
                    except for one clerk. There were a
                    couple of people in the store then, and
                    I was working with Stevo. And I like
                    Stevo, you know? But I was thinking,
                    what could I do to make them pick me to
                    be the clerk that gets to live?

     Mickey and Mallory charge into a 7/11 store, cocking their
     shotguns and shouting things.

     Mickey SHOOTS a CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

     Mallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

     Mickey points his shotgun at Bishop the store clerk and screams:

                               MICKEY
                    Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast!
                    Faster! Faster! Faster than that!

     Bishop stuffs money in a bag as Mallory guards the door, shotgun
     ready.

     STEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room
     carrying boxes and wearing a walkman.

     Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him.

     As all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes, Wayne's
     narration happens over it.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    They'd storm in with shotguns, and kill
                    every customer in the place right off

                    ...As spectators, reporters, law
                    students, tourists, gawkers, the
                    interested, the curious, the devoted,
                    and the demented were drawn to the Los
                    Angeles county courthouse like moths to
                    a flame.

                    The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder
                    trial was so event filled it made the
                    crime spree that took place before pale
                    by comparison. The first point was the
                    decision of Mickey's to act as his own
                    council. Now this in itself is not
                    unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy
                    acted as his own council as well. What
                    was unexpected was how well Mickey's
                    performance would be.

     INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

     Wayne interviews JUDGE BURT STEINSMA in his den at home.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was
                    the presiding judge during the Knox
                    trial.

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Mickey was surprisingly effective.
                    When I was told I was to be the judge
                    of this trial and then I was told
                    Mickey Knox would be handling his own
                    defence, I got a headache that lasted
                    five days. But at first I breathed a
                    sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very
                    prepared, and proved to be an excellent
                    amateur lawyer.

     INT. WANDA BISBING'S OFFICE - DAY

     Interview with state prosecutor WANDA BISBING, an attractive
     woman in her forties.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    However, this opinion isn't shared by
                    the state's prosecutor on this case,
                    Wanda Bisbing.

     Wayne's with Bisbing.

                               WAYNE
                    Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed
                    up very prepared and proved to be an
                    excellent amateur attorney.

                               BISBING
                    Oh, that's rich. Well, considering
                    that Mickey Knox turn his court into
                    a mockery and personally made him look
                    like a fool, I'd say that's very
                    benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far
                    as Mickey being an excellent amateur
                    lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but
                    when I went to law school, we were
                    taught the object was to win the case,
                    which I did.

                    Mallory fever, Mickey and Mallory
                    mania, if you will, as the merits to
                    Mickey's talent as a defence attorney
                    became apparent.
                    Law students from all ends of the
                    country converged on Los Angeles as
                    legal history took a new course. But
                    that was only the lemon next to the
                    pie. And that pie is you, the American
                    people. That pie is the way the
                    strangely charismatic, and make no
                    mistake, they are charismatic, Mickey
                    and Mallory have captured the public's
                    interest, fear, and in some cases,
                    admiration.

                         (confused)
                    But how can you say that?

                               SIMON

                               NORMAN
                    Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

                    How can you say that you 'admire' them?

                               NORMAN
                    It's like this, Wayne. Two people are
                    standing in a dark room waiting for the
                    other to attack. These two people
                    can't see each other, yet they know
                    they're there. Now, they can either
                    stand in the dark room forever waiting
                    until they die of boredom, or one of
                    them can make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    Why can't they just shake hands and be
                    friends?

                               NORMAN
                    They can't because neither knows if the
                    other is a deranged senseless killer
                    like the Knoxs. So, you may as well
                    make the first move.

                               WAYNE
                    And they made the first move?

                               NORMAN
                    Unfortunately, yes.

                               SIMON
                    But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    Why?

                               SIMON

                               WAYNE
                    How so?

                               SIMON
                    By taking away our legs. Now we have
                    to fight harder to get ahead than
                    anyone else you'll find in this gym.
                    Probably the whole city. They gave us
                    the fighting spirit. Before this
                    happened I was content. Now I'm pissed
                    off. Now I'm half a man and I've got
                    to work like the devil to get whole
                    again.

                               WAYNE
                    But you'll never be whole again.

                               SIMON
                    Never is a very long time, Wayne. A
                    word only the weak use. I'm not a sore
                    loser. Even if I don't have a leg to
                    stand on, I'm going to get up and fight
                    this world until I'm on top again.

                               NORMAN
                    That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

                               SIMON
                    That's the way of the world.

                               NORMAN
                    They're shocking the world into
                    remembering the primal law.

                               SIMON
                    Survival of the fittest.

                               WAYNE
                    One last question. Usually Mickey and
                    Mallory kill all of their victims. Why
                    did they let you two survive?

     The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

                               NORMAN
                    They had us tied down during one of
                    their house raids, you've seen the
                    headlines, and they were taking a
                    chainsaw to our legs before they were
                    gonna kill us.

                               SIMON
                    Just for fun, I guess.

                               NORMAN
                    And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,
                    'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

                               SIMON
                    Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,
                    'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

                               NORMAN
                    Apparently, they've seen all our films.

                               SIMON
                    They were especially influenced by
                    'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

                               NORMAN
                    So, Mallory calls 911 and they took
                    off.

                               SIMON
                    They actually apologized.

                    The couple proved so popular that a

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    We talked with Neil Pope, writer and
                    director of 'Thrill Killers' for his
                    take on the Mickey and Mallory
                    phenomena.

     Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets
     Wayne M.O.S.

     CUT INTO INTERVIEW:

                               NEIL POPE
                    It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
                    Knox are a cultural phenomena that
                    could only exist in our sexually
                    repressed society. A flower that could
                    only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
                    culture. A what I tried to do with
                    'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of
                    the problem all the way down the vine
                    to the original bad seed. Yet amidst
                    the violence and murder and carnage,
                    you've got the structure of a Wagnerian
                    love story.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.
     The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,
     shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,
     where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up
     against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the
     subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, honey, listen to me.

     Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,
                    but--

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    I can't run with you, Mickey! I really
                    want to. If I could, I would, but I
                    can't. I gotta stay here. But you can
                    still get out of here.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    If they stay, they'll catch you, and
                    they don't have to catch you---

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    No fuckin' way!

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, you're wasting time!

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I don't give a damn if a million United
                    States marines, all whistling the halls
                    of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'
                    down this alley any second. There
                    ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm
                    leaving you. And that's that!

     Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

     The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey, my love, if you leave me,
                    they'll catch me and take me to the
                    hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em
                    kill you. Then it'd be like I killed
                    you. I could bear anything, but I
                    couldn't bear that. So please, please,
                    for me, my handsome
                    husband, run for your life.

     The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    I can't do it. You're my wife, you're
                    my partner. A fella doesn't run when
                    his partner can't run with him.
                    Mallory, my angel, if I could of left
                    ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

     They kiss.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me
                    a gun so I can go out shooting.

     Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little
                    tougher for 'em.

     Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the
     corner at the arriving COPS.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                         (to himself)
                    Time to get naked and boogie.

     Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,
     then places the barrel under her chin.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    Mickey!

     Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Yeah baby.

                               MOVIE MALLORY
                    You made every day like kindergarten.

     Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

     DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

     Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless
     body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

     Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

                               MOVIE MICKEY
                    Mallory!

                                                    CUT TO:

     BACK TO: THE POPE INTERVIEW

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Why did you kill Mallory? Both of
                    them are still alive.

                               NEIL POPE
                    It was dramatic license, no doubt. But
                    I felt an operatic love story needed an
                    operatic ending. The two of them kill
                    for each other. They offer the death
                    of their victims to each other like
                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.
                    So what more natural, what more
                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory
                    offering her death to Mickey? It's
                    where it's been leading since day one.
                    We worked it in the movie by using a
                    what if they escaped situation. I
                    think it works beautifully. You'd be
                    surprised. People come up to me at the
                    end of the movie in tears.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

     Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks
     to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna
     is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.
     His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               JESSIE
                    One thing about Mickey for sure, he's
                    definitely a man who has his moments.
                    It was wild playin' him. It was one of
                    those get-it-out-of-your-system
                    performances.

     INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY

     This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.
     BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her
     lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name
     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

                               BUFFY
                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I
                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played
                    her as a woman in love, who also
                    happens to murder people. I didn't
                    want her to be at arm's length from the
                    audience or myself. If you play her as
                    this wild maniac, the audience never
                    has to deal with her. If you see a
                    decapitation in a movie, you just say
                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'
                    Because you can't relate to a
                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything
                    to anybody because it's not personal.
                    Decapitations don't fall into most
                    people's realm of life experiences.
                    But if you show somebody in a movie
                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience
                    squirms. Because everybody can relate
                    to a paper cut.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

                               BUFFY
                    I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.
                    But I read some letters she wrote to
                    Mickey before the murder spree. They
                    helped me out a lot.

                    Yeah, I visited him when he was up in
                    Susanville. He's a little cerebral for
                    my taste, but all in all, we got along.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.
     REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    To get a psychiatric view on the
                    strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
                    seems to have, we talked with Doctor
                    Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and
                    author.

     Wayne begins his interview.

                               WAYNE
                    Can you shed some light, Doctor
                    Reinghold, on why the public has taken
                    a pair of sociopaths so close to their
                    bosom?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Well, for one, the media has done a
                    tremendous job of turning the husband
                    and wife mass murderers into
                    celebrities. But it's the country's
                    youth who have turned the couple into
                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
                    the very thing that makes them most
                    lethal is the exact same thing that
                    captures the public's hearts and
                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
                    devotion to each other. In a world
                    where people can't seem to make the
                    simplest relationships work and the
                    slightest emotional commitment is
                    considered devastating, Mick and
                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the
                    country's youth, 75 percent of which
                    are coming from broken homes, that's
                    appealing. They have an 'us against
                    the world' posture which always appeals
                    to youth. And they've taken that
                    posture seventeen steps beyond.
                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's
                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
                    exciting. I read their file and I find
                    myself turning the page like it was a
                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
                    disillusioned housewives read romance
                    novels? Why are you filming this
                    special? Because you know as well as I
                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to
                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey
                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb
                    with violence. They've created a world
                    where only two exist and anybody who
                    inadvertently enters that world is
                    murdered.

                    Of the six teens murdered that night,
                    seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was
                    the lucky one left to tell the tale.
                    And this haunted young lady summoned up
                    the courage to take the stand, tell
                    what she saw that horrible night, and
                    then allow herself to be cross-examined
                    by the man who killed her brother and
                    girlfriends.

     All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media
     event.

     Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators
     and reporters surround the car.

     Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start
     walking up the courthouse steps.

     Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask
     questions.

     Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the
     direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

     She remains silent and scared.

                    examining you?

     Grace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the
     crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we
     hear the cry of:

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                    Mickey and Mallory!

     CAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying
     Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps
     they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit.

     Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by
     SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them
     and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their
     faces.

     Mickey's wearing a black leather jacket over a white t-shirt,
     which is covered with blood. Blood is smeared on his face, and
     he's holding a knife pressed to his lips, also covered with
     blood. But he's walking and talking with the same manner and
     poise as in the courtroom.

                    Well, he's my older brother. When we
                    were growing up, there were times we
                    could of very well done without each
                    other. But when it counted, we were

                               MICKEY
                    When you study the martial arts, they
                    give out belts that come in different
                    colors to signify what level you're at
                    in your training. Am I correct on that
                    point?

                               GRACE
                    Yes you are.

                               MICKEY
                    What was the color of Tim's belt?

                               GRACE
                    The style of fighting that Tim studied
                    didn't believe in belts.

                               MICKEY
                    Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,
                    could you tell us what form of martial
                    arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

                               GRACE
                    Tim studied several styles, but his
                    favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

                               MICKEY
                    Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research
                    on that form of fighting, and I found
                    out that Jeet Kune Do was a style
                    developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know
                    that?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.
                    Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting
                    style.

     CU of COURT CLERK'S HANDS typing in SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, while I freely admit total
                    ignorance on the subject, I have heard
                    of Bruce Lee. And I was under the
                    impression that Bruce Lee was one of
                    the, if not the greatest fighter in the
                    history of martial arts.

                               GRACE
                    That's what Tim said.

                               MICKEY
                    So, I think it would be safe to say
                    that anybody who studied the fighting
                    style that Bruce Lee, arguably the
                    greatest martial artist of all times,
                    developed for nine years, that would be
                    a fella who could defend himself.
                    Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, I would.

     Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand.

                               MICKEY
                    Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands
                    registered as lethal weapons?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, they were.

                               MICKEY
                    That means his hands are considered a
                    weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I
                    correct on that point?

                               GRACE
                    Yes, you are.

                    Was there any vengeance on your part

                    what they did in my court, and judge
                    worth his robe will tell you the same
                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my
                    decision. That's why they have judges.
                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
                    but when it's showtime, we have to make
                    a decision. That's why we don't just
                    input all the facts into a computer for
                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
                    give them the death penalty. See,
                    California hops back and forth on that
                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
                    court when it was out of favor, which
                    is actually good because it leaves more
                    room for imagination. Anybody can give
                    somebody the chair. When you have
                    someone who deserves to die and you
                    can't kill them, you have to be
                    creative. And if the bastards had let
                    it stand, it would of been the perfect
                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they
                    lived. Far more punishing than the
                    death sentence.

                               WAYNE
                    Would you please describe for our
                    viewers what your sentence was?

                               JUDGE STEINSMA
                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,
                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day
                    and they're a very cold lot. They have
                    no more feelings about taking a
                    person's life than squashing a tiny
                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
                    to watch their expression change'
                    attitude personified. Except with each
                    other. And, since they lived only for
                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at
                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
                    sentence was double life for each
                    without any possibility for parole.
                    That would be fairly standard in their
                    case. The twist I added was that the
                    husband and wife would have no contact
                    or correspondence with each other for
                    the rest of their lives. And they
                    would never receive any word or
                    information about the other.
                    So, basically once the cell door slams
                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will
                    completely disappear from each other's
                    life. They'll never know when the
                    other dies. But alas, the best laid
                    plans of mice and men...

                    The sentence was never to reach that
                    point. Because after only a year,
                    Mickey and Mallory created so much
                    mayhem that it was decided...

                    We talked with Dewight McClusky,
                    chairman of the California State Prison
                    Board, about this curious turn of
                    events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

     INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Wayne's interviewing McClusky.

                               WAYNE
                    Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
                    to an asylum? And who made the
                    decision?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board made the decision. A
                    board of which I belong. We're the
                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and
                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully
                    they'll receive the help they need.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed
                    competent in a mental examination
                    before their trial. I'm confused.
                    What's changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Well, since that time, they've killed
                    one person during their trail. And
                    since their incarceration, they've
                    killed one psychologist along with
                    several guards and inmates.

                               WAYNE
                    When they were found competent before,
                    they had already killed fifty people.
                    Other than the fact they're a
                    disciplinary problem, which frankly
                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still
                    don't see where this situation is any
                    different then it was before. So, I
                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's
                    changed?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our
                    minds. We felt they were competent a
                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a
                    year where they were under close
                    observation, day in and day out, and
                    their behaviour has led us to believe we
                    were wrong.

                               WAYNE
                    Who is we?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    The prison board and the doctors who
                    examined them.

                               WAYNE
                    Were any of the doctors who made the
                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
                    state asked to re-examine them?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Using the same doctors is not common
                    practice.

                               WAYNE
                    I take it by your answer it was a whole
                    new team?

                               MCCLUSKY
                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They
                    were different men. I hadn't really
                    thought that much about it. Since many
                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,
                    sought out for this kind of situation.
                    What do you think normally happens?
                    The Knoxs are assigned a family
                    psychologist that takes care of them
                    throughout the rest of their lives?
                    The state doesn't work like that.

     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    It's a funny situation actually. If
                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
                    a damn, what the prison board is doing
                    would be considered an outrage. The
                    prison board is basically saying, 'We
                    can't handle these guys.' They've
                    moved 'em around twice since their
                    sentence started.
                    They were a handful everywhere they
                    went. Now the prisons they're at now
                    want them outta there. But no other
                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
                    'em. So the prison board is left
                    scratching their heads wondering what
                    they're gonna do. Well, what they
                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
                    medical court that found them crazy.
                    Then they get them transferred to
                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric
                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and
                    Mallory cease to be a problem to
                    anybody except the orderlies who clean
                    out the bedpans, which if you want to
                    see them get theirs, that's all well
                    and good. But there's something being
                    said here. Forget the immorality for a
                    second. Forget the corruption and the
                    skulduggery involved. What the board
                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and
                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.
                    They were put in an alternative society
                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the
                    powers that be, can't deal with these
                    two kids. And whatever can't be
                    assimilated has to be terminated.

                               WAYNE
                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
                    are not insane?

                               DR. REINGHOLD
                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace
                    to living creatures, yes. But to
                    suggest that they're insane gives the
                    impression that they don't know right
                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know
                    the difference between right and wrong.
                    They just don't give a damn.

     specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

     Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the
     back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front
     driving.

                               WAYNE
                         (with mouthful of donut)
                    How's it working, Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Perfecto!

     Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to
     him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

                               ROGER
                    Where the fuck's the chocolate cream
                    filled? Did anyone get my chocolate
                    cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

     CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

                               ROGER
                    I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.
                    You saw me do it, didn't you?

     Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

                               WAYNE
                    You were there. Did you see him put it
                    in a box?

     We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

                               ROGER
                    At the time, I was too busy explaining
                    to Scott the finer points of film.

     We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Yeah, right. You know what he said?
                    He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple
                    Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

     Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

                               WAYNE
                         (to Roger)
                    You can't be serious?

                               ROGER
                         (preoccupied)
                    I'm as serious about that as I am about
                    going back to the donut store, and
                    dipping that stupid Mexican's head into
                    the batter for forgetting my chocolate
                    cream filled. Gimme that other box.

                               WAYNE
                    Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

                               ROGER
                    That dumbass probably put my chocolate
                    cream filled in there by mistake.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, no.

                               ROGER
                    What's the big deal? Take out my
                    chocolate cream filled, put one of
                    these roasted coconut---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, do you understand what the word
                    'no' means? It's important we
                    establish a rapport. Something as
                    simple as a dozen donuts can mean the
                    world to somebody who hasn't had a
                    donut in a year.

                               ROGER
                    So you're giving a man who butchers
                    whole families, little babies included,
                    my chocolate cream filled?

     Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the
     windshield.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County
                    Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

                               ROGER
                    Wayne---

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.
                    Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and
                    gather your gear.

     The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent
     Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

                               WAYNE
                         (aside to Scott)
                    Here's the welcome wagon.

     Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

                               WURLITZER
                    Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.
                    We talked on the phone. It's a
                    pleasure to meet you.

                               WAYNE
                    Same here. Let me introduce my crew.
                    Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie
                    ...this is...I'm sorry. What's
                    your title again?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm the superintendent here at L.A.
                    County Jail. Me and my deputies are
                    who you'll be working with while you're
                    here.

                               WAYNE
                    That sounds great. Look, I don't want
                    any of this to intimidate you. This is
                    not going to be a big deal. This is
                    going to be very easy.
                         (to his crew)
                    I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You
                    guys get your equipment ready, power up
                    the van and confirm a transmission code
                    for the remote. Julie come with me.

     Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks
     confidentially to Wurlitzer.

                               WAYNE
                    The main thing I need is a big room,
                    shut off from the population, so we can
                    get some privacy...with a few
                    electrical outlets.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from
     the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect
     for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS
     around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his
     sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

     Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA
     moves from person to person without cutting.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to two Deputies)
                    This is just for an interview, I was
                    on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.
                    It was a much bigger deal than this.
                    They had a crew of maybe seventy-five
                    people.

     CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

                               WAYNE
                    We're gonna be talking over here. But
                    I want enough freedom so if I wanna get
                    up and move around, we can.

     Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

                               WAYNE
                    Take him and walk him over this way.
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,
                    what the hell was that all about?
                         (pauses--to Scott)
                    Then maybe take him to the window.

     He walks Scott to the window.

                               WAYNE
                         (pretending Scott's
                         Mickey)
                    So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail
                    today, what's the first thing you'd do?
                         (pause--to Scott)
                    Little shit like that. I don't wanna
                    have to feel I gotta stay in the
                    chairs. We're after a cinema verite,
                    anything can happen, truth twenty-four
                    times a second kindda feel.

     End of single SHOT.

     Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    And when it's lunch time, they don't
                    just go to McDonalds. They got cooks
                    there servin' great food. Swedish
                    meatballs...

     Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

                               WAYNE
                    Everything's coming along just fine.
                    Phil, I wanted to know if I could have
                    a small word with you.

                               WURLITZER
                    By all means.

     Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around
     the room.

                               WAYNE
                    You met the kids I have working for me?
                    Great bunch, aren't they?

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

                               WAYNE
                    Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,
                    magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I
                    could sooner do without my arm than
                    Unruly Julie.

                               WURLITZER
                    Is that her real name?

                               WAYNE
                    Just a little nickname. Yep, they're
                    my kids and they're all I need. After
                    working together these past coupla
                    years, we're like well-oiled machinery.
                    No, more like a Formula race car. No,
                    scratch that one, too. What we're
                    really like is a Swiss watch. Small,
                    intricate, compact...it shouldn't
                    work as well as it does, but it does.
                    Because of the craftsmanship, the
                    expertise, and the artist's loving
                    hand.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

                               WURLITZER
                    I see.

                               WAYNE
                    Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever
                    been on a set before---

                               WURLITZER
                         (proudly)
                    Ya know, I was.

                               WAYNE
                         (acting surprised)
                    Really?

                               WURLITZER
                    I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set
                    about eight years ago.

                               WAYNE
                         (still acting surprised)
                    Well...small world. Well, then, you
                    know firsthand how Hollywood does
                    things. Lights all over the place,
                    generators, a hundred and fifty crew
                    members---

                               WURLITZER
                    Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there
                    was probably ninety-five people there,
                    maybe more.

                               WAYNE
                    See what I mean? It's a funny
                    business, isn't it?

                               WURLITZER
                    It sure is.

                               WAYNE
                    They got a asshole over here.
                         (pointing to his left)
                    A asshole sitting down reading a
                    magazine over there.
                         (points to his right)
                    A asshole perched up there.
                         (points straight up)
                    Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we
                    were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang
                    stuff we'd need all those assholes,
                    too. What we're about is intimacy.
                    We're about two people having a
                    conversation. Say I was interviewing
                    you. All I want you to worry about is
                    what I ask you. I want a trust to
                    develop. If you're thinking about all
                    this...
                         (indicates the hustle and
                         bustle of a set)
                    ...you're not going to relax, a trust
                    won't develop, we'll be talking a each
                    other instead of to each other, there
                    will be no chance for intimacy.

     Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

                               WAYNE
                    That's why my crew is only three...an
                    invisible three.
                         (switching gears)
                    Which brings me to what I wanted to
                    talk to you about. I have to get
                    Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to
                    share what he's never shared before...
                    Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till
                    today have been closed. Well, how can
                    we expect him to do that when we got
                    Los Angeles County Sheriffs up
                    the walls.

     Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

                               WURLITZER
                         (snorts)
                    Well, just what the hell do you expect
                    me to do?

                               WAYNE
                    Lose 'em.

                               WURLITZER
                    Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest
                    idea how dangerous Knox is?

                               WAYNE
                    Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very
                    familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

     They're out and out angry.

                               WURLITZER
                    Since he and his wife have been in
                    custody, they've killed---

                               WAYNE
                    Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure
                    I know 'em better than you do.

                               WURLITZER
                    Well, let me let you in on one more fact you
                    obviously don't know. If I were to
                    take my men away, Mickey Knox would
                    snap your neck like a twig.

                               WAYNE
                    One...I can take care of myself. I
                    grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and
                    I've handled some pretty rough
                    customers in my day. Mickey Knox
                    doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a
                    journalist, and I'm prepared to take
                    that risk. Three...it ain't gonna
                    happen. Believe me when I tell you, it
                    is in Mickey Knox's own best interest
                    to play this game according to Hoyle.
                         (pause)
                    Wait a minute. We've gotten into a
                    advisory relationship here, which is
                    not what I want.
                         (pause)
                    But seriously, Phil, look at this.

     Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.

                               WAYNE
                         (counting)
                    We got one...two...three...four
                    ...five...six...seven...eight.
                    I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too
                    much. Let's lose some of these guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wayne, if it was anybody else---

                               WAYNE
                    Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam
                    up on me with all these sheriffs all
                    over the place. They hate him. He
                    hates them. What kinda intimacy am I
                    gonna create with all this hate in the
                    air. Even you and I feel it.

                               WURLITZER
                    What are we talking about?

                               WAYNE
                    Two guys?

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay. I'll take two guys off.

                               WAYNE
                    No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two
                    guys.

                               WURLITZER
                    I can't do that. Five guys.

                               WAYNE
                    Three.

                               WURLITZER
                    I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but
                    that's it.

     INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

     Mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head.

     CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in
     the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open.
     The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and
     shackles.

                               DEPUTY #1
                    On your feet! Turn your face to the
                    wall.

     Mickey gets up.

                               MICKEY
                    Now what you're supposed to say is:
                    'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

     OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

     CU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell
     door makes her up with a jolt.

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Rise and shine, Mallory!

     Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two
     deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and
     WASHINGTON.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and
     Washington's shiny black shoes.

     The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,
     along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,
     reverberates throughout the scene.

     Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding
     deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a
     cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long
                    and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

     Mallory looks straight ahead.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    See, I've been there twice. And I'm
                    not lookin' forward to goin' back. But
                    I'm in and out. You, on the other
                    hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the
                    rest of your life there. Now that's
                    what I call cruel and inhuman
                    punishment.

     Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Course you're not gonna give a shit.
                    'Cause when the good doctor's get
                    through givin' you the zap...
                         (he puts his finger next
                         to his temple, pantomimes
                         being electrocuted)
                    ...You won't know where the hell you
                    are. They'll just put you on a window
                    sill, and water you every other day.
                       
     Mallory lets out a big yawn.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly
     Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his
     entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally
     bursting into laughter.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    And when he gets here, its no dick'n
                    around time. Make him up, clip a mike
                    on him, then leave him alone. I don't
                    want you talking to him. I don't want
                    you getting in his face. I want you
                    hiding behind your gear. You are
                    invisible.

     CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the
     supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how
     he can still walk.

                               WAYNE
                         (to his crew)
                    Okay, break.

     Wayne's team disburses.

                               WURLITZER
                    Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

     Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others
     start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.

     Wayne approaches Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Wayne)
                    Okay now, before we get started here,
                    there's a few things we have to get
                    clear about.

                               WAYNE
                    All right, Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove
     the chains.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The
     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring
     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to
     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's
     wrists.

     Mallory's silent.

     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

                               BINGHAM
                    Turn around and face the wall!

     Mallory does.

     Bingham and Washington move to the door.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Wait outside for a second, fellas.

                               BINGHAM
                    We're not supposed---

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Don't worry about it.

     Bingham and Washington move outside.

     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before
     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back
     to him.

     Scagnetti walks up behind her.

     Mallory doesn't move.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Want a smoke?

     Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    C'mon, I already lit one for you. I
                    know you smoke.

     Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
     mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of
     Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I was reading the file on you. You
                    know what it said during your
                    trial, whenever they put you on the
                    stand, no matter what they asked, your
                    answer was always the same...'I love
                    Mickey.' It also says that when they
                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'
                    was the only thing you said that
                    registered as the truth.

     Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky
                    Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your
                    Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is
                    that the attraction? Or does he just
                    got a big dick?

     Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a
                    big donkey dick.

     Scagnetti presses closer.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is
                    close your eyes and remember...
                    remember the last time ol' Mickey gave
                    you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'
                    about it? Good. Remember it. Don't
                    ever forget it cause it ain't never
                    gonna happen again. Cause when they
                    get through with all that electroshock
                    shit they got lined up for you two,
                    Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

     Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.
     Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Look. You're gonna sit here for a
                    couple hours while I finish up the
                    arrangements. The reason they picked
                    me to be your chaperone is they know I
                    won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.
                     
     Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    So, during our journey, if any wild
                    hairs spring up on your ass, you'd
                    better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with
                    me, bitch, even a little bit, you're
                    gonna get accidentally shot!
                    Comprehende?

     Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD
     BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a
     horrible scream.

     EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell
     door.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti
     face down on the ground.

     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break
     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's
     screaming.

     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their
     shotguns.

     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,
     screaming.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    She broke my fucking nose! That bitch
                    broke my nose!

     Washington comes over to him and helps him up.

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (blood down his face)
                    She broke my nose.

                               WASHINGTON
                    I'll fix it.

     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.
     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down
     from the pain.

     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down
     from his face, looking over at Mallory.

     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun
     barrel placed in her mouth.

     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold her, boys.

     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun
     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on
     either side of her, holding her in place.

     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings
     it up to Mallory's face.

     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
     eyes, and all over her body.

     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on
     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They
     can't look at this anymore.

     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her
     all over her body.

     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the
     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can
     back to Washington.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I want this filled before we leave.

     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking
     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of
     excruciating pain.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a
     microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to
     Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    How come you never talk?

                               ROGER
                    She was born without a tongue.

                               MICKEY
                         (repulsed)
                    Oh my God!
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Sorry.

     Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and
     continues applying make-up.

     Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.

                               WAYNE
                    So we got a deal. Four deputies---

                               WURLITZER
                    And me.

                               WAYNE
                    Why don't we make it three deputies and
                    you?

                               WURLITZER
                    Why don't I have Mickey thrown back
                    into his cell and we can forget the
                    whole thing?

                               WAYNE
                    Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and
                    you, I can live with that. We're about
                    ready to go here, so let's get rid of
                    these other assholes.

                               WURLITZER
                    Don't call my men assholes.

                               WAYNE
                    I didn't mean they were assholes. I
                    mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta
                    here.

     Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up
     a light stand.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of
                    these assholes. Now I want to create
                    the illusion that this is just Mickey
                    and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.
                    So make sure you don't film these
                    assholes. I don't want to see 'em on
                    film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'
                    slated our spot as human interest which
                    means we'll go live at just after
                    five-thirty.

     Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G.

     Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.

                               WURLITZER
                    This asshole's tryin' to tell me what
                    I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!
                    This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's
                    dealin' with here, but we do. And if
                    shit happens, he ain't gonna be
                    responsible, we are. So keep your
                    shotguns out, your fingers on the
                    triggers, and be ready to fire at a
                    moment's notice.

     BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a
     donut. He takes a big bite.

                               ROGER
                    Say something.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    What?

                               ROGER
                    Anything.

     Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.

                               MICKEY
                         (talking in rhyme)
                    I stand amid the roar
                    Of a surf tormented shore,
                    As I hold within my hand
                    Grains of the golden sand--
                    How few! yet how they creep
                    Through my fingers to the deep,
                    While I weep--while I weep!
                    O God! can I not save
                    One from the pitiless wave?
                    Is all that we see or seem
                    But a dream within a dream?

     Mickey bites into the donut.

                               MICKEY
                         (mouthful of donut)
                    How was that?

     Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.

                               ROGER
                    Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment
                    here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n
                    roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the
                    donut place put a chocolate cream
                    filled I asked for in your box.

                               MICKEY
                    There's a chocolate cream filled in
                    there?

                               ROGER
                    Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

                               MICKEY
                    Tough titty, it's mine now.

                               ROGER
                    Look, I'll trade you.

     Wayne enters frame.

                               WAYNE
                    Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!
                    What did I tell you. Stop bothering
                    Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

                               ROGER
                         (to himself)
                    Fine. Roger, what the hell are you
                    doing? You're bothering the serial
                    killer.

     Roger exits FRAME.

     Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Sorry about that.

                               MICKEY
                    Don't worry about it.

                               WAYNE
                    We're about ready to go here. Are you
                    ready?

                               MICKEY
                    Let's do it.

     Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay people! Let's start to settle
                    down here.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16mm - BLACK & WHITE

     SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of
     Mickey's eye.

     CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Are you comfortable?

     Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Roger?

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Rockin'!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Scotty?

                               SCOTT (O.S.)
                    Rollin'...and speed!

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Slate it.

     CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into
     view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the
     FRAME.

                               WAYNE
                    So, Mickey, tell us what you do for
                    fun.

                               MICKEY
                    Aside from the obvious?

     Mickey breaks out laughing.

                               WAYNE
                         (not amused)
                    Yes. Aside from the obvious.

    Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, let me see now. What do I do for
                    fun?
                         (to people O.S.)
                    Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are
                    drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.
                         (to camera)
                    Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just
                    sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies
                    smokin' up a storm, and it's really
                    doin' it to me.

     A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights
     it. Deputy exits FRAME.

                               MICKEY
                    Much obliged. What do I do for fun?
                    Do you want to know what I do for fun
                    or what I did for fun?

                               WAYNE
                    What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun
                    for starters.

                               MICKEY
                    What I did for fun for starters.
                         (thinking)
                    Well, something I used to do...always
                    was a lot of fun...
                         (pause)
                    No, scratch that. Let me think of
                    something else. In fact, why don't we
                    come back to that question. Ask me
                    something else.

                               WAYNE
                    Do you miss Mallory?

                               MICKEY
                    Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my
                    wife. I haven't seen her in a long
                    time. What a stupid question.

                               WAYNE
                    Then was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was what worth it?

                               WAYNE
                    Was massacring all those people worth
                    being separated from your wife for the
                    rest of your life?

     Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you think up these questions or the
                    girl with no tongue?

                               WAYNE
                    No, Mickey, I can't let you get away
                    with that shit. Answer the question.
                    Was it worth it? You haven't seen,
                    heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.
                    Was it worth it?

                               MICKEY
                    Was an instant of purity worth a
                    lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

                               WAYNE
                    Excuse me, did you say an instant of
                    purity? What was the instant of
                    purity? The bodies you left behind on
                    your bloody trail?

                               MICKEY
                    That's only part of it. I mean, it's a
                    big, big, big part. But it's only the
                    chorus, it's not the whole song.

                               WAYNE
                         (passionately)
                    Please explain to me, Mickey, where's
                    the purity that you couldn't live
                    without in five year old Danny
                    Millhouse's blown off head? Where's
                    the purity in forty-eight people who
                    are no longer on this planet because
                    they met you and Mallory? What's so
                    fucking pure about that?

     CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes
     a slow drag off his cigarette.

                               MICKEY
                    Where the purity comes into play---

     The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams.

     WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that
                    thought. Reload, quick!

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     We're back to COLOR 35mm.

     WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell.
     CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her
     face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to
     subside.

     All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Love is a hurtin' thang,
                    and it leaves a fiery sting.

                               SCOTT (V.O.)
                    Okay. Okay, we're up again.

                               WAYNE (V.O.)
                    Roll it. Save the slate.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     16MM - BLACK & WHITE

     We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of
     film.

                               WAYNE
                    You just said an instant of purity was
                    preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't
                    understand. What's so pure about
                    forty-eight dead bodies?

                               MICKEY
                    You'll never understand. Me and you,
                    Wayne, we're not even the same species.
                    I used to be you...then I evolved.
                    From where you're standing, you're a
                    man. From where I'm standing, you're a
                    ape. I'm here...I'm right here...
                    and you...you're somewhere else, man.
                    You say why? I say why not?

                               WAYNE
                    Tell me about the purity.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughing)
                    It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and
                    a smoke only get you so far. You're
                    gonna have to do your job.

                               WAYNE
                         (laughs)
                    Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll
                    move on and come back later.

                               MICKEY
                    I'm sure we will.

                               WAYNE
                    Describe Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                    Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,
                    she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two
                    feet, two hands, ten fingers...

                               WAYNE
                    Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You
                    know what I mean. Describe Mallory.
                         (points at his head)
                    What's up here?
                         (points at his heart)
                    What's in here?

                               MICKEY
                    That's indescribable.

                               WAYNE
                    Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do
                    you feel about the fact that you're
                    never gonna see Mallory again?

                               MICKEY
                         (smiles)
                    Says who?

                               WAYNE
                    Says the United States of America.

                               MICKEY
                         (laughs)
                    When have they ever been right?

     The crew laughs (O.S.)

                               MICKEY
                    Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.
     His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.
     Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to
     Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't
     believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

                               MICKEY
                    ...one night I was asleep, and a noise
                    wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,
                    somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a
                    gun, so I go into the living room with
                    a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned
                    out to be nothing. God made the noise.
                    Who knows?

                               SCAGNETTI
                         (whispers)
                    How's it goin'?

                               WURLITZER
                         (whispers)
                    Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

     Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.

                               WURLITZER
                    What the hell happened to you?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    You should see the other bitch. What
                    time you got?

                               WURLITZER
                    Two-thirty. Shhh...

     CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of
     the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to
     Mickey's story.

                               MICKEY
                    But I came to the direction I need a
                    gun. Do, the next day I started off
                    early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a
                    gun shop and pick up a little home
                    protection. I walked into the place
                    and had never seen so many guns in all
                    my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the
                    this really nice sales guy comes up to
                    me. His name was Warren. I'll never
                    forget his name. He was really nice.
                    Anyway, Warren showed me all these
                    different models of guns. Magnums,
                    automatics, pistols, Walters. And I
                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a
                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon
                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew
                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.
                    It felt like it was a part of me. They
                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at
                    myself holding it, and looked so
                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.
                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
                    Turned my car around, drove to
                    Mallory's house, we took care of
                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,
                    and we were off.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

     SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     MEDIUM CU on Mickey.

                               MICKEY
                    Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The
                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,
                    they all missed the point of the story.
                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding
                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I
                    realized for the first time my one true
                    calling in life. I'm a natural born
                    killer.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, let's cut it.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

                               WAYNE
                         (to Scott)
                    Did ya get that?

     Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.

                               SCOTT
                    It's gonna be beautiful.

                               WAYNE
                    Super cool.
                         (to Mickey)
                    This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

                               MICKEY
                    I could go for a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

                               WURLITZER
                    I'm not running out and getting that
                    piece of shit a Coke.

                               WAYNE
                    Fine.
                         (to Unruly Julie)
                    Julie, why don't you make a food run?
                         (to the room)
                    What's around here?

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    There's an In and Out Burgers about a
                    block away on Olive. It's walking
                    distance.

                               WAYNE
                    Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.
                    I'll have a double double with cheese,
                    french fries, and a large Coke.

     Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then
     goes from person to person collecting their orders.

     Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

                               WURLITZER
                    Are you all set?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready
                    to roll.

                               WURLITZER
                    I assigned you Bingham and Washington
                    to go along.

     In B.G., Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah, we met. They're good men.

                               WURLITZER
                    They're real Goddamn good. They'll be
                    there for when ya need 'em. Where
                    are they?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Waitin' in the lounge.

                               WURLITZER
                    How 'bout Mallory?

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

     Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In
     the B.G., we hear the wall phone BUZZ.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

                               WURLITZER
                    Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

     Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    Capt'n!

                               WURLITZER
                    Yeah?

     The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF
                    They need you. Emergency!

     Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into phone)
                    Talk to me.
                         (pause)
                    Where?
                         (pause)
                    For the love of Pete...okay...okay
                    ...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on
                    my way.

     CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious
     eavesdroppers.

     CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,
     Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

     CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's
     conversation.

     OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a
                    riot going on in the laundry room.

                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
                    Is it serious?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    It sure as hell is. They got guns,
                    hostages, and explosives.

     The room reacts.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Jack, could you stay up here for a
                    while?

                               SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
                    Yeah, sure.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    I'm taking one of these men. Yates,
                    come with me.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Could we go with you and film it?

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Stay up here and finish your interview,
                    I've got to see what the hell's going
                    on down there before I can take
                    responsibility for you to film there.

     We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.

     Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her
     notebook.

                               MICKEY
                    I'll have a four by four. That's four
                    patty burgers. Now they don't have
                    that on the menu, but if you order a
                    four by four, they'll know what you're
                    talking about. A large Coke and two
                    orders of fries.

     When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off
     silently.

     CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

     CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

     As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the
     CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the
     DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.

     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall
     masques with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds
     of a riot swell until...

     A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a
     MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

     The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before
     moving on.

     CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling
     across the floor.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

     SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

     FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Sure.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty
                    funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now
                    in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.
                    And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks
                    her mother if she can go out on a date.

     As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's
     CAMERA follows.

                               MICKEY
                    The mother asks, 'Where's he taking
                    you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in
                    movie.' The mother tells her she can
                    only go if she takes Little Johnny with
                    her. She says okay. They go to the
                    drive-in, they come back. The mother
                    gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,
                    what happened? Where did ya go?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
     like he's driving.

                               MICKEY
                    Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What
                    did they do?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

                               MICKEY
                    'They kissed. What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.

                               MICKEY
                    'He felt her up? What else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

                               MICKEY
                         (dumbfounded)
                    'They took off their clothes? What
                    else?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.

                               MICKEY
                    'They did it? What were you doing?'

     Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking
     off.

     Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,
     even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

     As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4
     during the punchline.

     While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy
     #4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from
     Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with
     the butt.

     Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

     Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     The other deputies react.

     Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in
     the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with
     a THUD.

     Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching
     position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

     Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

     The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him
     out of FRAME.

     Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --
     SLOW MOTION.

     CU of ceiling being BLASTED.

     Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.

     Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to
     fire -- SLOW MOTION.

     Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti --
     SLOW MOTION.

     Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.

     Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

     They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of
     the room.

     Nobody fires.

     We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on
     the ground, scared to death.

     CU on Scagnetti's face.

     CU on Mickey's face.

     CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then
     CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

     OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into
     a CU on his face.

                               MICKEY
                    Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Slide the shotgun over here, put your
                    hands behind your head, put your
                    forehead on the floor.

                               MICKEY
                    Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow
                    you in half and you know it.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    I've never wounded anything in my life.
                    I got you locked right between the eyes.

     Mickey rises.

                               MICKEY
                    If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'
                    you in half on three. So, if you got
                    me locked, take the shot. One...

     DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in F.G., past the gun, to his face.

     CU of barrel of shotgun.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Two...

     DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.

     Wayne watches, wide eyed.

     ECU on Mickey's face.

                               MICKEY
                    Three!

     MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Hold it! Don't shoot!

     He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up.

                               MICKEY
                    Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

     Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.

     The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet -- SLOW MOTION.

                               MICKEY
                    Toss it.

     Scagnetti does.

                               MICKEY
                    Now put your hands behind your head.

     Scagnetti does.

     Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand,
     facing each other.

                               MICKEY
                    Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

                               SCAGNETTI
                    What?

     Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti
     hits the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.

     Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.

                               MICKEY
                    You guys stay on your bellies.

                               ROGER
                    Yes, sir.

     Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.

                               MICKEY
                    I am the most dangerous man in the
                    world.

     Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.

     Scagnetti screams.

     Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.

                               MICKEY
                         (points at Scagnetti)
                    You're the law.
                         (points at himself)
                    I'm the law breaker.

     Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.

     Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.

                               MICKEY
                    Donut, get your camera. See if it's
                    broke.

                               WAYNE
                    Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

                               MICKEY
                    Scott's dead. And unless you wanna
                    play follow the leader, shut up and do
                    as you're told.


     Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds
     like a lawn mower.

                               MICKEY
                    How is it?

                               ROGER
                    Not good.

                               MICKEY
                    Do you have a back up.

                               ROGER
                    It's video.

                               MICKEY
                    Even better. Wayne call your station,
                    tell 'em we're going live a little
                    early today. Make it happen!

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a
     TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only
     see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the
     FRAME and we can vividly hear the SOUNDS of chaos around us.

                               WURLITZER
                    I want two men stationed in that tier,
                    and I want men with rifles all along
                    the walkway.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Capt'n!

     Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the layout of the laundry room.

                               WURLITZER
                    Where do the air ducts lead?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    Here.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Problem is they'll hear somebody
                    approaching that way.

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    We turned off the power when they took
                    over the room.

                               WURLITZER
                    We turn it back on. The machines go
                    back on supplying us with the cover
                    noise we need. Smithy, do it.

                               SMITHY (O.S.)
                    Right away, Capt'n.

     CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    Yes.

                               WURLITZER
                    You sure?

                               JONESY (O.S.)
                    I think--

                               WURLITZER
                    Never say you think when you know, or
                    you know when you think.

     Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Bergman, you in place?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

                               WURLITZER
                         (into walkie talkie)
                    Pass this to your team...the second
                    they get a lock on a blue, they're to
                    take the shot. Do you understand?

                               BERGMAN (O.S.)
                         (from walkie talkie)
                    That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks to his right.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you think, Pitney? How much
                    Explosives do you think that they
                    really have in there?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    It's hard to say Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Take a wild stab!

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

                               WURLITZER
                    The entire wing?

                               PITNEY (O.S.)
                    That's my opinion.

                               WURLITZER
                    Jesus...

     Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.

                               MICKEY
                    Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie

                    Ladies and gentlemen, in case you have
                    just tuned in, it appears that a
                    hostage situation involving Mickey Knox
                    is developing presently at the Los
                    Angeles County Jail. We have seen that
                    he is armed and apparently there has
                    been some loss of life. We will try to
                    re-establish contact with Wayne Gayle
                    and bring you more on this late

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

     WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and
     grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go
     of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it
     loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off
     the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

     Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and
     slips it into his pants.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.
                    Stand behind me, put your back against
                    mine and extend your arms behind you.

     Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against
     Mickey's.

                               MICKEY
                    Now if I feel your back move away from
                    mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
                    Got it?

     Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

                               SCAGNETTI
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, Wayne, step forward.

     Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus
                    against the barrel.

     Wayne does.

                               MICKEY
                    Grab his arms.

     Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with
     gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

                               MICKEY
                    Either one of you two move, it's gonna
                    be shotgun city. You understand?

                               WAYNE & SCAGNETTI
                    Yes.

     Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

                               MICKEY
                    You ready, Donut?

                    Ready.

                               MICKEY
                    Wagons, hooaaa!

     The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with
     the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's
     walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to
     his neck.

     Roger follows with the camera.

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to
     herself, and doing the hand motions.

                               MALLORY
                         (singing)
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha
                    dodaleedo, dodaleedo.
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha
                    dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing
                    there isn't much to it.
                    All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I
                    like the rest,
                    but the best part I like is
                    Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo,
                    dodaleedo, do
                    quack, quack.

     The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey,
     Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up
     along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped
     with tape.

     CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    Honey, I'm home.

     Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This
     kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something
     everybody told them they would never do again.

     For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're
     enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.

                               MALLORY
                         (in between kisses)
                    It's taken you so long to come to me.

     INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     A sheet of paper flashes through FRAME.

                               BAILEY (O.S.)
                    Here's the list of the rioters.

     CAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up.

                               WURLITZER
                    Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the
                    list of the hostages?

                               BAILEY (O.S.)
                    I'm working on it Capt'n.

                               WURLITZER
                    Keep on it, son.

     Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces.

                               WURLITZER
                         (reading the names)
                    Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez,
                    Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos,
                    Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard...

     Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with
     his hands.

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    Capt'n.

     Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down.

                               WURLITZER
                    What is it Napalatoni?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    Mickey Knox is loose.

     Wurlitzer looks up.

                               WURLITZER
                    What do you mean he's loose?

                               NAPALATONI (O.S.)
                    He's armed, he's killed three deputies
                    and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the
                    moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox
                    in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,
                    another TV guy, that cop fella, and two
                    other deputies as hostages. And
                    Capt'n, they have one of them news
                    cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't
                    stop playin' it. What do you want us
                    to do?

     Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his
     mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing
     would come out. He just sits.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

     The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against
     the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly
     as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken
     fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is
     standing, alert and ready for action.

     As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,
     tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is
     panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man.

     Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, we're going out that door, and
                    we're gonna march down the hall and
                    right out of the building.
                         (to Wayne)
                    Donut said something about a news van.

                               WAYNE
                    Yeah, we have a van.

                               MICKEY
                    Where's it parked?

                               WAYNE
                    Out front.

                               MICKEY
                    Let me have the keys.

     Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses
     the keys to Mickey.

                               WAYNE
                    Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

                               MICKEY
                    No.

                               WAYNE
                    This is crazy. You can't escape like
                    this.

                               MICKEY
                    Probably not, but we're gonna give it
                    the old college try.

                               WAYNE
                    We'll all be killed.

                               MALLORY
                    Exciting, isn't it?

     Duncan begins to cry.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, when we get out there, you do what
                    we say or it's curtains. If we say
                    move, you move. If we say left, you
                    move left. If we say right, you move
                    right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.
                    Got it?

                               MALLORY
                    Are we in a big hurry?

                               MICKEY
                    You got something you want to do?

                               MALLORY
                    Yeah.

                               MICKEY
                    By all means, knock yourself out.

                               MALLORY
                    Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

     Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

     VIDEO FOOTAGE:

     Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she
     points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

                               MALLORY
                    You! Stand up!

     Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the
     wrong woman.

     Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

                               MALLORY
                    You probably thought it was pretty
                    funny, didn't ya?

     She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.
     Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

                               MALLORY
                    Can you remember the last time you
                    fucked with me? Close your eyes and
                    remember...Are ya thinking about it?
                    Good.

     Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

     Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger
     HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

                               DUNCAN (O.S.)
                    Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

                               MICKEY
                    We're sending out a hostage. Don't
                    touch him!

     OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

     Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory
     jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using
     the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell
     and...

     INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

     There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

     CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the
     caravan.

     The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,
     real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

     The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,
     and gunfire.

     HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

     The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

     Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees
     this and screams.

                               MALLORY
                    Mickey!

                               MICKEY
                    Don't stop!

     Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.

                               ROGER (O.S.)
                    Man, oh, man...this is better than
                    Vietnam!

     More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

     Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using
     DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.
     Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

                               DUNCAN
                    Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

     CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.
     The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

     Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
     control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

     CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls
     into FRAME screaming.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Get the camera! Get the fucking
                    camera!

     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

     As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from
     Roger's side.

     The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last
     hostage.

     Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
     and silent.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Mallory)
                    This way.

     INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan
     the remaining hostage deputy.

                               MICKEY
                         (to Duncan)
                    Where does this lead?

     Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to
     wall.

                               MICKEY
                    Where!?!

                               DUNCAN
                    Th-- the ground floor.

                               MALLORY
                    Is that the front door?

     Duncan nods frantically.

                               MICKEY
                    Let's go.

     Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the
     stairs. They go down a few flights.

     As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team
     of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies
     raise their guns.

     Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand
     pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other
     are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

                               MALLORY
                    Back off or I'll blast him! Back off
                    or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll
                    blast him!

     None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
     likely to start shooting.

     Wayne screams.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!
                    Please, please, please...

     Wayne continues begging.

     Wurlitzer steps forward.

                               WURLITZER
                    Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

                               MALLORY
                    Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna
                    hear it!

                               WURLITZER
                    You have to know---

                               MALLORY
                    I said shut up...

     Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him
     in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

     Wayne's screaming in pain.

     The deputies jump back.

                               MALLORY
                    ...and I mean shut up!

     There's a bit of a silent standoff.

     Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly
     retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

     The deputies hold their present position.

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY

     The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory
     let their two hostages sit down.

     Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his
     uniform.

     Mickey's pacing.

                               MICKEY
                    Think...think...think...

     Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her
     hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's
     been shot.

     Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling
     from below.

                               WURLITZER (O.S.)
                    Give up! There's no other way out!

     Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.
     him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

                               MALLORY
                    Look, lover boy, we're not getting
                    outta here. So I say the hell with
                    going back to our cells. Let's do a
                    Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
                    Run down these stairs shootin', go out
                    in a hail of bullets, but take as many
                    of those motherfuckers with us as
                    possible.

     Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

                               MICKEY
                    We'll do that when all else fails.

     Mickey stands.

                               MALLORY
                    Hasn't it?

                               MICKEY
                    We still got a few tricks up our
                    sleeves.

     Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You married?

                               DUNCAN
                    Oh, I don't wanna die...

                               MICKEY
                    Are you married? Do you have kids?

     Duncan nods pathetically.

                               MICKEY
                    Good. People, we're goin' all the way
                    to the front door. Now, the only way
                    we're gonna get there is if they don't
                    want to kill you two more than they
                    want to kill us.

     INSERT:

     SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill
     Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

                               MICKEY (V.O.)
                    Right now I find that highly unlikely.
                    So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

     BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:

     Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

                               MICKEY
                    Now, say I tell those guys down there
                    if they shoot or make a move, I'm
                    killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or
                    make a move anyway. Now say by some
                    freak accident, you didn't die, you
                    live though it. What would you do?

     Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts
     tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

                               WAYNE
                    What would I do? Me and my network
                    would sue the entire Los Angeles County
                    Sheriffs Department for flagrantly
                    disregarding my safety. I'd go
                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and
                    make sure everyone of those son of a
                    bitches down there ends up on the
                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue
                    every man down there personally. I
                    would make it my life's ambition to
                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.
                    I would do expose after expose on the
                    brutality, and the conditions, and the
                    inhumanity that exists here.

     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.
     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
     around the barrel of his shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    That's what I thought. You tell them
                    that. When we go down those stairs, I
                    want you to scream what you just told
                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the
                    star of American Maniacs watched every
                    week by'-- how many people?

                               WAYNE
                    On average forty million.

                               MICKEY
                    'Every week by forty million people. I
                    am a respected journalist.' Have you
                    won any awards?

                               WAYNE
                    Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The
                    Edward R. Murrow award...

                               MICKEY
                    'Respected journalist'-- On your
                    knees...

     Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props
     his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the
     barrel around his neck.

                               MICKEY
                         (continues)
                    ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the
                    Edward R. Murrow award among others.'
                    Tell 'em the name of your personal
                    lawyer, his firm, his address, and
                    phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor
                    and the unemployment lines. You
                    getting the idea?

                               WAYNE
                    Yes.

     Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the
     stock of the shotgun.

                               MICKEY
                    Say it. Scream it. All the way out
                    the front door and into your van. And
                    if you stop screaming, I swear to God
                    I'll blow your head off.

                               WAYNE
                    Got it.

     Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before
     shouting to Duncan.

                               MICKEY
                    You! What's your name?

     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory
     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before
     reading his name badge.

                               MALLORY
                    Duncan...Homolka?

                                                    CUT TO:

     INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

     Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when
     they hear:

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    Start.

     Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

     The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they
     take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would
     die.

     Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
     shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in
     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he
     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE
     and COLOR 35mm.

     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA
     on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be
     spared.

                               WAYNE
                         (yelling)
                    My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star
                    of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty
                    million people every week! I am a
                    respected journalist, winners of the
                    Golden Globe, the Edward R.
                    Murrows Award among others! If anybody
                    puts me in danger, my network will sue
                    The Los Angeles County Sheriffs
                    Department. My estate will sue every
                    officer personally who fires. The
                    network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis
                    and Sinclair...

     Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the
     deputies.

                               MALLORY
                         (yelling)
                    Make a path!

     The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

     The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne
     yelling all the way.

     The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they
     keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front
     lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

     Wurlitzer stands his ground.

                               WURLITZER
                    How far do you think your gonna get?

                               MICKEY
                    Right out the front door.

                               WURLITZER
                    That'll never happen.

                               MICKEY
                    It is happening.

     The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep
     their weapons ready.

     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

                               MALLORY
                    Don't stop!

     Wayne starts up again.

     The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer
     are nose to nose.

                               WURLITZER
                         (to Mickey)
                    I will personally hunt you down, blow
                    the head off your fucking-whore-wife,
                    and plant your sick ass in the ground
                    all by myself.

                               MICKEY
                         (calmly)
                    Another day perhaps, but not today.

     Mickey leaves FRAME.

                                                    CUT TO:

     EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,
     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open
     air.

     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while
     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE
     LEADER.

     EXT. WOODS - DAY

     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &
     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being
     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a
     fence post.

     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not
     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly
     into the CAMERA.

                               WAYNE
                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and
                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are
                    shooting with a wild camera and a
                    standard recorder we found in the van.
                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked
                    out the front door, into my news van
                    and made our getaway. When we were
                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox
                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
                    and tossed his body out of the back.
                    Mickey told authorities over my police
                    band that I would surely be next if
                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They
                    took Mickey at his word and called off
                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
                    employed, I don't know. My only
                    thought is it all happened too fast for
                    arrangements to be made. We've just
                    pulled off to the side of the road to
                    do this interview. Tensions run high--

     Mickey screams O.S.

                               MICKEY (O.S.)
                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!

                               WAYNE
                    Without any further ado, Mickey and
                    Mallory...

     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting
     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces
     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's
                    plan? Did you think it would work?

                               MALLORY
                    It wasn't 'till we got on the ground
                    floor that I totally realized they
                    weren't gonna shoot unless we shot
                    first. When we got out of the
                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my
                    God. This might work.' But
                    Mickey knew it would work all along.
                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.
                    It's not like there was and he just
                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    What did you think then?

                               MALLORY
                    I wondered how long it would be before
                    we'd get to be alone together. And I
                    wondered if I could wait that long.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Did you have anything to do with the
                    riot in the laundry room?

                               MALLORY
                    Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'
                    word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can
                    I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Try to keep it to a minimum.

                               MALLORY
                    We had nothing to do with that riot.
                    That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

     Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

                              MICKEY
                    Divine intervention.

                               MALLORY
                    What he said. We didn't know jack shit
                    about and riot. It just happened. It
                    was kismet. We didn't even know those
                    people. How are we supposed to
                    organize a riot when we've been in
                    fuckin' isolation for the past year?
                    Just bleep out the fucks and jack
                    shits.
                         (laughs)
                    I mean, it's not like we care. If they
                    wanna say we masterminded the whole
                    thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep
                    us up at night. But you said you
                    wanted the truth, and the truth is we
                    were just lucky.

     Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

                               MICKEY
                    C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    So, what now?

                               MALLORY
                    Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take
                    it easy. Just enjoy each other's
                    company, stop and smell the roses,
                    notice the color purple, stuff like
                    that.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    How do you intend to disappear? you're
                    probably the most famous couple in
                    America.

                               MALLORY
                    Well, back in slave times they had a
                    thing called the underground railroad.
                    And we got a whole fan club out there
                    just waiting to be conductors.
                         (to the camera)
                    So, you kids out there, keep the faith.
                    Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'
                    to your town real soon.

                               MICKEY
                    Okay, that's enough. End of interview.
                    We gotta move.

     Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
     lowers it from his eye.

                               WAYNE (O.S.)
                    Okay, just let me swing around and film
                    myself asking the questions. And then
                    I'll do my little wrap up.

     Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
     balances it on a fence post.

                               MICKEY
                    Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,
                    all right. But it won't be you starin'
                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting
                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be
                    starin' down the barrels of our
                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the
                    triggers.

     Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into
     a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

                               WAYNE
                    That's a joke right?

     Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her
     shotgun from off the ground.

                               WAYNE
                    Just wait one fucking minute.

                               MICKEY
                    I said I'd give you a interview. Now
                    unless I'm mistaken, we just did a
                    interview.
                         (to Mallory)
                    We did an interview, didn't we?

                               MALLORY
                    Looked like an interview to me.

                               MICKEY
                    I said we'd give you an interview. I
                    never said we wouldn't kill you.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt
                    during this...this whole escape that
                    a kind of bond--

     Wayne is shaking.

                               WAYNE
                         (continues)
                    ...developed between the three of
                    us. We're kindda in this together,
                    don't ya think?

                               MICKEY
                    No. Not really.

                               WAYNE
                    Don't touch those triggers! Please. I
                    think I've already proven that a live
                    Wayne Gayle is much more better that a
                    dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your
                    passport out of jail, not Duncan
                    Homolka. But me! I'll be your
                    passport outta---

                               MICKEY
                    Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate
                    you. If anybody in the fuckin' world
                    deserves to die, it's you.

     Wayne is grasping for anything.

                               WAYNE
                    Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and
                    Mallory always leave somebody alive to
                    tell the tale.

                               MICKEY
                    We are.
                         (points to camera)
                    Your camera.

     Mickey turns to Mallory.

                               MICKEY
                         (John Wayne voice)
                    Let's make a little music, Colorada.

                               WAYNE
                    NO!!!

     The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,
     who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

     Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing
     into the news van, they drive away.

     Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA
     eventually runs out of film.

1   INT. SUV -- DAY                                                 1

    No sound. We are in a speeding SUV. The passenger, LARA,
    unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
    driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
    SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
    collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
    something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:

                       THE LAST THREE YEARS

2   INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       2

    Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
    LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN           
    is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
    kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
    to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
    is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
    LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
    to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
    at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
    brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,          
    if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
    her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.        
    Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.                

                           LARA
               You know what? If you were smart
               you would stop talking right now.

                           ERIT
               Sue me. I just know that women should                     
               never work for women.

    John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head.                    

                           LARA
               How can you say that??

                           ERIT
               They're always threatened. Especially
               if you're beautiful and they're not.

                           LARA
               Erit, you are so full of shit.

                           ERIT
               So, your boss isn't threatened by
               you?

                             LARA
                 Because she's a bitch! --
                     (as John and Mick laugh)                             
                 --Not because she's a woman.

                             ERIT
                 And you would describe her as
                 "attractive"?

                             LARA
                 That has nothing to do with it!

                             ERIT
                 And there is my answer.

                             JOHN
                 Either of you like another drink?

    Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.

                             ERIT
                 Women should work under men, men
                 under women. That's it.

                             JOHN
                     (egging her on)
                 But men under men?

                             ERIT
                 That's fine, too.
                     (the men burst into laughter)
                 They're used to it! Why are you
                 laughing?

                             MICK                                         
                     (re: Erit)
                 I don't know, bro, but I think I'd
                 rather work under you than her.

                             ERIT
                     (insulted, shoots back)
                 Oh please, I'd rather work under
                 him, too.

    That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.                

                             LARA
                 You'd rather "work under" John?

                             ERIT                                         
                 You have a problem with that, too?

                             LARA                                            
                 No, why would I have a problem with                         
                 your little sexual innuendo?                                

                             ERIT                                            
                 What is up your ass tonight??

    Mick throws John a "This is all your fault and now it is                 
    going to explode" look. John feigns complete innocence.                  

                             LARA
                 So, I shouldn't take offense that
                 you're coming on to my husband right                        
                 in front of me.                                             

                             ERIT
                     (claws out now)
                 Lara, if I wanted your husband I
                 would have him.

                             LARA
                 How? You couldn't possibly show him
                 more of your tits.

    The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.

                             ERIT
                 -- You know what your problem is?!

              JOHN                             MICK                          
      That was a great meal!           Okay--okay!

3   EXT. STEAK HOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT                               3

    Mick and Erit head toward Mick's sporty pickup.     John and             
    Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.

                             JOHN
                 She is completely full of shit.

                             LARA
                 DON'T try and agree with me now.

                             JOHN
                 You know what? I don't even believe
                 she is in the dental profession.

    Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her
    black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.

                             LARA
                 Shut up.

                             JOHN
                 I bet she can't even spell
                 anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete
                 fraud.

                             LARA
                 We went to her office party, idiot.

                             JOHN
                 I think she hit on me that night,
                 too.

    Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in
    the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....

                             LARA
                 You are completely delusional. She
                 wasn't even hitting on you in there;
                 I just don't like her.

                             JOHN
                 I understand. People who look like
                 that should not be allowed anywhere
                 near oral surgery.

    She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it
    away.

                             LARA
                 You are such an asshole.

                             JOHN
                 You're in the chair trying to stay
                 calm; how are you supposed to do that
                 with those things hanging over your--

    She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she
    stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip
    under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 Someone's going to --

    Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and
    it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.

    After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors.
    She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.

4   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BACK DOOR -- NIGHT                            4

    Lara and John enter, Lara carrying her raincoat, her hair
    sticking up in the back, John's shirt untucked.

                               LARA
                 Hello!

    JENNA, the teenage baby-sitter, sees right through them.

                               LARA (CONT'D)
                 Did he cry?

                             JENNA
                 Only when I dropped him down the                                
                 stairs.                                                         

    Lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.

5   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY                                   5

    She peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly.

6   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                              6

    Lara comes down to find John paying Jenna. John nods for
    her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.

                              JOHN
                 Thanks.   See you next weekend.

    Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out.
    John reacts: "Oh God." Lara's smile broadens; she kisses
    him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again.
    He feels for the light switch. He finds it; we cut to BLACK.

7   INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                   7

    Lara wakes, troubled.      It's the middle of the night.

8   INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT                                               8

    Lara finds Luke's window closed but unlocked. She locks it
    and looks out. Satisfied, she sits and watches her son sleep.

9   INT.    KITCHEN -- MORNING                                              9

    Three year-old LUKE holds a knife and fork as he sits at the
    table watching his dad cut up his pancakes.

                             JOHN
                 Okay, your turn.

    Luke skewers a piece with his fork.        Lara passes, hustling
    to get to work.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 Very good, very good...

                                                   (CONTINUED)
                                                                6.

    Luke puts it in his mouth.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)
                 No, no, no; you feed me.
                     (to Lara)
                 Your son is hopeless.

    Lara grabs her phone and leans over them to take a photo.

                             LARA
                 Squeeze in tight.

                             JOHN
                 You can't do this every morning.   It
                 is way too corny.

                              LARA
                 Smile.   It's just until he's eighteen.

    It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric
    toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go.

                              LARA (CONT'D)
                 Present.

                             JOHN
                     (examining it)
                 Sweetie, you have to stop believing
                 everything you read in a catalogue.

                             LARA
                 You hate brushing your teeth; this
                 one brushes them in thirty seconds.

                             JOHN
                     (as if stung)
                 I love brushing my teeth.
                     (to Luke)
                 The lies your mother tells.

                             LARA
                     (ignoring him)
                 When's your last class?

                             JOHN
                 Three, and I have papers to grade.
                 Can you pick up Luke?

                             LARA
                 After yesterday I probably don't
                 have a job anyway. Do you think it
                 was wrong to call her a useless cow?

                  Bosses admire that kind of frank                         
                  exchange.

                  Did you call your father?

                              JOHN
                  When?

                              LARA
                      (heading for bathroom)
                  "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!

10   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM                                   10

     Lara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin.

                              JOHN (O.S.)
                  I sent him flowers and a handmade
                  card.

                              LARA
                  You're completely impossible.

                              JOHN (O.S.)
                  Did you notice what I got for my
                  birthday this year? A grunt.

11   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                    11

                              JOHN
                  Mom said Happy Birthday and my father
                  went . Made me tear up.

     Lara returns, trying hard not to smile.

 LARA                   Ever think that someone has to be
                  the bigger person here?

 JOHN                       (to Luke)
                  Remember this for the custody hearing:
                  how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.

 LARA                   How are you going to feel if Luke
                  grows up and doesn't call you?

     Lara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer.

 JOHN                   Now she's driving a wedge between us.

 LARA                   I give up.

 JOHN                   And now she is abandoning you.

     Lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back
     shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.

12 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 12 
     Lara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it
     run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings.

13 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 13 
     John rises to answer the door.

14 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM 14 
     Lara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood
     on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it.

15 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 15 
     As John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge.
     DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John
     has no time to react.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                   Police.   Mr. Brennan?

     LUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared.

 DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)                   My name is Detective Quinn. This is
                  a search warrant for these premises.

     John hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside.

 DETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D)                       (stops him)
                  Stay where you are.

 JOHN                   Get your --

 DETECTIVE QUINN                   Touch me again and you'll be arrested.

16 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWN THE HALL 16 
     Lara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero.
     She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member,
     who takes it and bags it under:

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                 Lara Brennan?

 LARA WHAT?! 
 DETECTIVE COLLERO                 Lara Brennan, you are under arrest
                for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.

     She takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her.

 LARA                 She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead??

17 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER 17 
 JOHN                     (tries to push past)
                She didn't do anything!

 DETECTIVE QUINN                 I will only --

 JOHN                     (tries again)
                She didn't do anything!

 DETECTIVE QUINN                 Put him in cuffs.

     The uniform pushes him up against the wall and cuffs his
     wrists. John watches as his child cries, his wife is led
     out in handcuffs and the house is torn apart. Cut to BLACK.

18 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 18 
 LUKE (O.S.)                 Daddy!...    DADDY!!

     A light comes on.   John steps out of his bedroom and enters
     his son's room.

 JOHN (O.S.)                 It's okay.     Just a bad dream.

     He comes back out carrying Luke, now SIX YEARS-OLD.
 10. 


19 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 19 
     John lays Luke on the bed and climbs in beside him.

 JOHN                   You okay?

     Luke nods.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Okay, you can sleep here as long as
                  you stay on this side of the bed.

     Luke immediately scrambles over his father to take his side.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   You're such a snake, I don't know why
                  I keep falling for the same trick.

     John kisses Luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow.

     John reaches for the lamp. Beside it sits the framed photo
     that Lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning.
     He switches off the lamp, and the screen goes BLACK.

20 EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY 20 
     The "T," the city's fast-moving trolley, rises up from
     underground and we CRANE UP to see the city.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   But Sam's your friend, right?

21 EXT. ALLEGHENY COUNTY JAIL -- DAY 21 
     Tilt down from a passing T-Train to find John and Luke,
     walking toward the huge, modern Allegheny County Jail.

 LUKE                   Not at lunch.

 JOHN                   Does he take your food?

 LUKE                   No.

 JOHN                   Did he say something mean?
                      (Luke nods)
                  About Mommy?



 (CONTINUED) 11. 
21 CONTINUED: 21 
 LUKE                   Yeah.

 JOHN                   Did you hit him?

 LUKE                   Yeah.

 JOHN                   Good.    Where did you hit him?

 LUKE                   Near the swings.

 JOHN                   Wow.    I bet that hurt.

 LUKE                   Yeah.

22 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 22 
     - John waits in a long line, mostly women. He glances over
     at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and
     sees children playing. Luke plays by himself.

     - John puts his key ring in a plastic container. The guard
     takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
     John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
     through and the buzzer goes off.

     John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him
     with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal
     detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something
     from his pocket, looks at it curiously.

 JOHN                   It's a toy!

     The guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech.
     The guard waves John through. No beep. John kneels and
     pulls on Luke's jacket.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Don't worry.     We'll get it back.

23 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 23 
     They walk along the hall with all the other visitors.
 12. 


24 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 24 
     John stares out the window at the city beyond.    Life seems
     so close.

     He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
     round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
     are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
     of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.

     The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
     prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.

     Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
     hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
     and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
     who plays with his back to her.

 LARA                 Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?
                    (no response. Tickles him)
                Come on, give Mommy a kiss.

 JOHN                 Rat-Bag.   Give Mommy a kiss.

     He gives her a peck on the cheek and goes back to his Legos.

 LARA                 Is Daddy reading you my letters?

 JOHN                 Every night at bedtime.

 LARA                 What are you building?    A fort?

     Lara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head
     and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand.

 LARA (CONT'D)                 Was he scared going to school?

 JOHN                 I walked him to class, gave him a kiss;
                he didn't even look back to wave.

 LARA                 What did you make him for lunch?

24 CONTINUED: 24 
 JOHN                   Turkey sandwich, just butter and
                  bread, no "vegetables" on it. He
                  swore he ate his apple.

     He hands her a pack of photos.      Lara devours them.

 LARA                   Look at his friends.   And his desk.
                  This is his teacher?

 JOHN                   Miss Phillips.

 LARA                   You may have to move to another school
                  district.

 JOHN                   Already spoke to a realtor.

 LARA                       (still looking at photos)
                  How was your first day?

 JOHN                   Excellent. Over half my class stayed
                  awake. Talked to your mom.

 LARA                   When is she coming?

 JOHN                   She's having a lot of trouble with
                  her business.

 LARA                   It's only been a couple of years,
                  I'm sure she'll get around to it.
                      (beat)
                  Have you heard anything?

 JOHN                   About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just
                  not telling you. What did Meyer
                  say?

 LARA                   --Don't--

 JOHN                   -- It can take months for the court
                  to rule.

 (CONTINUED) 14.

 LARA                   I saw that woman. She was there.
                  She couldn't have just disappeared.

 JOHN                   Meyer's looking for a new
                  investigator.

 LARA                   Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a
                  button pop - they must have been
                  blind not to find it.

 JOHN                   He'll go through all the evidence
                  again.

 LARA                   Great, because I haven't quite
                  bankrupted us yet.

 JOHN                   We're doing fine.

 LARA                       (fondly)
                  You just lie and lie.
                      (strokes his face)
                  But you are very handsome.
                      (admiring him)
                  Can you do me a favor?

 JOHN                   I don't know, I'm a little busy.

 LARA                   I need you to run for governor.

 JOHN                   -- Oh, that I can do.

 LARA                   You can change this rule about no
                  conjugal visits, because I don't
                  think I can last another twenty years.

     She smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place.    He
     reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   I'm okay.   I'm okay.

 JOHN                   I know. But it's going to be fine.
                  I promise.

     She just stares at Luke, his back to them, playing.

 LARA                   You think he'll ever want to kiss me
                  again?

25 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER 25 
     The prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and
     blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other
     visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room.

26 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 26 
     Lara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump-
     suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for
     contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls
     it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation.

27 INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT 27 
     Start VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke           
     standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a             
     complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the
     toilet, staring at his watch.

 JOHN                   Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

     Luke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Good?

     Luke nods.

28 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING 28 
     The garage door opens; the Prius has a lot more miles on it.
     John backs out, Luke in his child seat. He brakes and finds
     PAULA, the woman who lives behind them, at his window.

 PAULA                   How's Lara?

 JOHN                   She's doing okay.



 (CONTINUED) 16. 
28 CONTINUED: 28 
 PAULA                   Tell her we're pulling for her.

 JOHN                   I will.

     She holds up a plastic water bottle.

 PAULA                   They won't recycle these unless you
                  take off the cap.
                      (cap vs. bottle)
                  This is trash. This is recyclable.

 JOHN                   Ok.   Thanks.

     John drives off, wondering what kind of world he lives in.

29 EXT. PARK -- DAY 29 
     Sitting on the park bench, John allows his feelings to wash
     over his face. He watches Luke play with a girl his age.

 JOHN                   Luke!   Let's go, Toad.   Come on.

     Luke runs to him. John pulls Luke's jacket on. He doesn't
     notice the young mother on the next bench, NICOLE, watching
     him admiringly. She calls to the girl Luke was playing with.

 NICOLE                   Time to go, Carrie!

     John glances in time to see CARRIE plop down in the sand,
     arms folded. He shares a sympathetic smile with Nicole, who
     heads to retrieve her daughter. John walks off with Luke.

30 INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY 30 
     John waits as a courtroom lets out. MEYER FISK steps out
     with a young associate. He spots John and approaches.

 MEYER                   John, I said my office at four
                  o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --

 JOHN                       (holds up a Subway bag)
                  I figured you had to eat.

     Meyer relents, turns and calls to his associate.

 MEYER                   Do you have the ruling in Brennan?

     She kneels and digs through her rolling briefcase.

31 INT. COURTROOM -- A SHORT TIME LATER 31 
     John sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the
     ruling. The courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at
     his desk. During this he gets up and walks out past them.

 JOHN                   But what if we find the woman who                        
                  was leaving the parking lot?                             

 MEYER                   The PCRA was rejected. No new
                  evidence can be submitted. Not
                  anymore.

 JOHN                   It was a robbery!   Someone stole her
                  purse!

 MEYER                   And if they'd used her credit cards
                  we would have had something to argue.
                  I'm sorry; this really...sucks.

     John offers a smile at Meyer's unlawyer-like choice of words.

 JOHN                   So, that's it. Now we just have the
                  Supreme Court.

 MEYER                   John, in the last thirty years, the
                  Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder
                  case. No decent lawyer would even
                  file the pleadings.

 JOHN                   So, I need to find an indecent one?

 MEYER                   No, I'm going to file it. But I
                  need you to do something for me.

 JOHN                   Anything.

 MEYER                   I need you to look at the evidence
                  and just forget Lara is your wife.

 JOHN                       (stopped by that)
                  I've seen the evidence, Meyer.

 MEYER                   I'm not saying judge her innocent or
                  guilty, I'm just saying look at it.                        
                  He co-worker sees her leaving the                          
                  scene, she has the victim's blood on                       
                  her clothes, her fingerprints on the
                  murder weapon--

 JOHN                       (is this a bad joke?)
                  We went out for dinner! How do you
                  do that after you kill somebody?
                  She would have to be a psychopath!

 MEYER                   -- And the fight in the office.

 JOHN                   Everyone fights with their boss!

 MEYER                   But this one ended up dead.

     John looks at Meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed.

 JOHN                   So, you never believed she was
                  innocent?

 MEYER                   How can you say that?

 JOHN                   So, what are you saying, Meyer?!

 MEYER                   That it no longer matters what we
                  believe; Lara's not getting out.
                  And you have no idea how much I hate
                  saying that.

 JOHN                       (exiting)
                  I'll find someone to file the
                  pleadings.

 MEYER                   John! Come on! For Christ's sake.
 JOHN!! 
     John is long gone.    Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash.

32 INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- DAY 32 
     John waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The
     door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles
     and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face
     and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him.

     John fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up
     her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his
     face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably.

     John keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears
     run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her
     phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder --
     desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it.

     He bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention
     of the guard on his side.

     Lara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but
     she can't hear it, and neither can we.

33 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 33 
     We're in an old working class neighborhood.    John sits in
     his car, trying to pull himself together.

34 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 34 
     MICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from                   
     clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything
     they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door.                  

     In the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to
     see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away,
     uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention.

35 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- LATE AFTERNOON 35 
     John, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the                 
     back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their
     empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and
     George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John:

 ERIT                   I know you won't want to hear this...

 MICK                   -- Erit, go put somebody to sleep.

     She stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff.

 JOHN                   Thanks.

 MICK                   Had to be done.
                      (long beat)
                  I am really going to pay for that.

     John has to smile.

36 EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT (DUSK) 36 
     John drives through a rough part of town on their way home.
     He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A
     flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID.
     He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches
     John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off.

37 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 37 
     John sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and
     photographs. As John sifts through the evidence...

38 INT. LARA'S OFFICE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 38 
     Lara and her boss ELIZABETH argue loudly.

39 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 39 
     It's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a
     small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She
     turns toward camera --

     A FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible
     impact and

     ELIZABETH collapses to the floor.

40 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 40 
     Lara turns, holding the fire extinguisher.

41 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 41

42 EXT. PARKING LOT - THE PAST -- NIGHT 42 
     Lara's car speeds out of the parking lot. A male co-worker            
     steps out of the rain just as her car passes. He stops as             
     he sees ELIZABETH'S BODY lying beside her car.

43 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM - THE PAST -- DAY 43 
     Lara tries to scrub the blood off of her coat.

44 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 44 
     The phone beside him SHRIEKS.   John picks it up.

45 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- NIGHT 45 
     It's late; prime time for the ER.    John runs in.

46 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR -- NIGHT 46 
     John enters breathlessly and finds the Nurses' Station.

 JOHN                 Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent                        
                up here. Brennan. B-R-                                     

 DUTY NURSE                     (finds name in roster)                                 
                She can't have visitors.

 JOHN                 That's ridiculous; I have to see                           
                her.

 DUTY NURSE                 I'm sorry.

     John turns away and heads down the corridor to find her
     himself. The Duty Nurse sees this and takes off after him:

 DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)                 You can't go down there!

     John shoves open a door, moves on to the next.

 DUTY NURSE (CONT'D)                 You can't be in here!!

 JOHN                 Lara!

                  I got him!

 JOHN                   Lara!

     A long-haired doctor, BECSEY, steps into his path.

 DR. BECSEY                   What's going on?!

 JOHN                   My wife attempted suicide.

 HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE        Let's go.                                (hands doctor chart)
                                              She's not allowed visitors.

 JOHN                   I have to see her!

 DR. BECSEY                   Why isn't she in the ER?

 HOSPITAL GUARD 1 DUTY NURSE        I'm not asking. Now.                   She's a transfer from County
                                              Jail.

 JOHN                   Please.   Two minutes.

     Becsey is not unmoved.       He shares a look with the nurse.

47 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM -- NIGHT 47 
     DR. Becsey opens the door for John.          Note a prison guard
     standing outside.

 DR. BECSEY                   Two minutes.

     Becsey leaves. A uniformed female prison guard looks up
     from her magazine and keeps her eyes on John. He looks to
     his wife, who's attached to an I.V. and monitors, pale and
     weak, her arm bandaged where she cut it open along the artery.

     Lara opens her heavy eyelids and John glimpses something
     terrible in her eyes: she's tortured to be alive. He kneels
     beside her and puts a hand on the bed. She takes his little
     finger, wraps her fingers around it.
 WHITE 9-10-09 23. 


48 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT 48 
     John opens the door to let Jenna out; she looks considerably
     older.

 JENNA                  I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending
                 he's asleep.

 JOHN                      (reaching for his wallet)                             
                 Don't worry about it.

 JENNA                  It's okay.

 JOHN                  I insist.    I kept you out on a school
                 night.

 JENNA                  I'm not in school anymore.

     She offers a sad smile and leaves without the cash.

49 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 49 
     Luke lies in the crook of his father's arm, his own arms
     full of penguins, turtles, a black dog and an opossum. John
     reads him a letter, the yellow envelope open on the bed.

 JOHN                  And give a big hug to Pengui, Little
                 Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley,
                 Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of
                 love, Mommy.
                     (beat)
                 You gonna give them hugs from her?

                 Should we write her back?                                 

 LUKE                  ...When is she coming home?

 JOHN                  Soon honey.    Soon.

 LUKE                      (thinks for a moment, then:)                          
                 Can I have a quarter?

 JOHN                  Can you have a quarter?

     Luke points at the glass coin dish on night stand.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend
                  those. They come from the cottage
                  where Mommy and I used to take you
                  when you were a baby.

 LUKE                   Then can I have them all?

 JOHN                   ...Sure.

     He hands Luke the jar, and hoists up him and his animals.

50 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 50 
     Luke sets the coin jar on his nightstand. John tucks him in
     with his animals, then switches off the lamp. John looks
     back before closing it and watches Luke lie awake, staring
     at the jar, lost in confused thoughts of his mother.

51 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT 51 
     Dirty dishes piled in the sink, John unloads the dishwasher.
     He finds the handle has cracked off Luke's favorite mug. He
     places the cup and handle on the counter, opens a drawer
     crammed with tools and screws and tape and such. He rummages
     through it. Not finding what he is looking for, he pulls
     handfuls of junk out of the drawer and slams it all down on
     the counter. The harder he searches the more he becomes
     frustrated, until he slams the drawer and leans on the
     counter, feeling destroyed and needy.

     And then a female hand appears beside him, opens another
     drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to
     move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue,
     places it on the counter and moves away.

     John turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and
     shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room.

     Stunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then
     suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No
     sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts
     into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He
     flings it open...

52 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 52 
     John rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her --
     finally realizing she was never there.

     He stands in the middle of the street, now searching for some
     way to survive.

53 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY 53 
     Don Quixote is written on the chalkboard.

 JOHN                   So, what is it about?   Julie?

 JULIE                   That belief in someone's virtue is
                  more important than virtue itself?

 JOHN                   No. I mean, yes, that's in there.
                  But what is it about?

     No takers.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   It is about how rational thought
                  destroys the soul. It is about the
                  triumph of irrationality, and the
                  power that is in it.

54 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY 54 
     John drops an armload of books into a library cart, each
     having something to do with prison or prison life.

     He sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at
     a time and discards each in turn.

     As the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer
     screen linked to the school system.

     ON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by
     the school search engine -- many of the items have already
     been inspected. John finds one that reads "Over The Walls."              

     He clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author
     is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption
     reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY.

55 EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - STREET -- DAY 55 
     John gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar.

56 INT. BAR -- DAY 56 
     A couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV

 JOHN                   It's a course that investigates what
                  drives men to be free, no matter the
                  cost.

 DAMON                   Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?

 JOHN                   You escaped from jail seven times.                           

     Damon lights a cigarette.       A TOUGH GUY nearby objects.

 TOUGH GUY                   No smoking!!

 DAMON                   Yeah, who would want to cut short
                  your precious life?

     Damon takes a deep drag.

 JOHN                   Mind if I tape you?

 DAMON                   Go for it, it can't be used as
                  evidence. What do you want to know?

     John sets up the small digital recorder.

 JOHN                   How you escaped when no one else
                  could.

 DAMON                   Balls and a little luck.
                      (beat)
                  No prison in the world is airtight.
                  Each one has a key. You have to
                  find it.

 JOHN                   How do you do that?

 DAMON                   A lot of looking. Especially at
                  things that break the daily routine.
                  Guards get comfortable doing the
                  same thing every day. Something
                  happens where they have to think,
                  adapt.

                  ready. You have to have the entire
                  plan already in place before you
                  even know how you are going to get
                  out of the jail.
                  Escaping is easy; the hardest part
                  is staying free.

57 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 57 
     The tape recorder plays Damon's voice; John tears large sheets
     of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You have to know where you are going
                  to go and how you are going to get
                  there. You have to know how they
                  plan to catch you, where, and when.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   How the hell do you know that?

     He starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You pay off someone who knows. And
                  a lot depends on if the prison is in
                  the country or the city.

58 INT. BAR -- DAY 58 
 JOHN                   The city.

     That came out too quickly. Damon now understands. John
     sits, silent, knowing he blew it. Damon takes his time.

 DAMON                   Where are you from?

 JOHN                   ...Pittsburgh.

 DAMON                   Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges
                  and tunnels they can block off.

59 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 59 
     The art paper bunches and rips under the pressure of the
     marker. John tears it off the wall.

59 CONTINUED: 59 
 DAMON (O.S.)                   From the time they make the call,
                  the police can have the center of
                  the city sealed tight in fifteen
                  minutes.

60 INT. BAR -- DAY 60 
 JOHN                   How can they be so exact?

 DAMON                   After 9-11 Homeland Security made
                  every city have a lock-down plan --
                  downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston,
                  Minneapolis -- fifteen minutes.
                  They can do DC in under ten.

61 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 61 
     John draws a circle on the wall and writes in it: 15 MINUTES --

 DAMON (O.S.)                   Within thirty-five minutes they will
                  have cops at every tollbooth on the
                  interstate --

     -- Surrounds it by a larger circle: 35 MINUTES.

62 INT. BAR -- DAY 62 
 DAMON                   And be running rolling stops on the
                  secondary roads. They won't have
                  your photograph yet, but they will
                  have your description.

63 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 63 
     He draws spokes out from the circles.

 JOHN (O.S.)                   What if you can't make it out?

64 INT. BAR -- DAY 64 
 JOHN                   Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of
                  time.

 DAMON                   Then surrender.

 (CONTINUED) 29. 
64 CONTINUED: 64 
 DAMON (CONT'D)                   Because they will shoot you on sight,
                  along with anyone you are with.

65 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 65 
     John writes DESCRIPTION at the end of one spoke.

 DAMON (O.S.)                   Stay far away from the train and bus
                  stations.

66 INT. BAR -- DAY 66 
 DAMON                   Forget the local airports.   Leave
                  from another state.

67 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 67 
     John scribbles key words on the wall.     DISTANT AIRPORT.

68 INT. BAR -- DAY 68 
 DAMON                   Second: identity. It's easy to find
                  fake papers, harder to find ones
                  that will get you through an airport.

69 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 69 
     John writes "IDENTITIES."

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You'll need a passport, driver's
                  license and a social security number.

70 INT. BAR -- DAY 70 
 DAMON                   If you have to rent a car, find a
                  place that will take a cash deposit.
                  They'll still run a credit check, so
                  use a real person's name on the ID.
                      (beat)
                  Third: destination.

71 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 71 
     John writes furiously on the wall.    "DESTINATION."




 (CONTINUED) 30. 
71 CONTINUED: 71 
 DAMON (O.S.)                   You want somewhere that doesn't
                  attract American tourists and doesn't
                  get American newspapers. Think Yemen
                  and you get the idea.

72 INT. BAR -- DAY 72 
 DAMON                   Then money.

73 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 73 
     John's writes "MONEY."

 DAMON (O.S.)                   You need a truck load of it.
                  Everything's expensive: hotels,
                  travel, information.

74 INT. BAR -- DAY 74 
 JOHN                   How much?

 DAMON                   Enough to last at least five-six
                  years. Run out of money and you run
                  out of friends.

75 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 75 
     John underlines "MONEY."

76 INT. BAR -- DAY 76 
     John is starting to understand the enormity of this
     undertaking.

 DAMON                   But before you do anything, you have
                  to ask yourself if you can do it.
                  Can you forget about ever seeing
                  your parents again. Can you kill a
                  guard, leave your kid at a gas
                  station, push a nice old lady to the
                  ground because she is between you
                  and the door? Because to do this
                  thing, that's who you have to become.
                  And if you can't, don't start, because
                  you'll just get someone killed.
 31. 


77 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 77 
     John backs away from the wall to see it covered in a spiderweb
     of notes.

 JOHN (O.S.)                 How did you get caught?

78 INT. BAR -- DAY 78 
 DAMON                 I gave myself up. I couldn't take
                wondering when someone was going to
                come through the bedroom door.
                    (beat)
                Got what you need?

 JOHN                 Yeah.

 DAMON                 What do you have in your pocket?

     John opens his billfold.   Damon takes the cash, leaves him a          
     twenty.                                                                

79 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 79 
     On the wall we see the massive diagram John has created.
     The screen goes BLACK. Read:

 THE LAST THREE MONTHS 
80 EXT. T-TRAIN -- DAY 80 
     The train crosses a bridge.

81 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 81 
     John rides, looking down at the river below.

82 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 82 
     John steps through the puffer (the machine that detects drugs)
     and into the secure area. He makes a mental note of
     everything he sees: the number of guards, cameras, etc.

83 EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DELIVERY AREA -- DAY 83 
     John sits in his car on the road above, surreptitiously taking
     pictures of the vehicles coming and going from the prison.
 32. 


84 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 84 
     He tapes the photos to the wall.

85 INT. COUNTY JAIL -- DAY 85 
     Walking down a corridor with the other visitors, John steps
     in a puddle of water. Behind him the others notice and step
     around it. Moving on, they pass a trustee on a ladder pulling
     a water-stained ceiling tile away as two guards watch.

86 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 86 
     John traces a route on a map with a highlighter.

87 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY (NEW DAY) 87 
     The wall grows thick with photos and notes.

88 INT. CLASSROOM -- NEW DAY 88 
     He reads an article on his computer -- about illegal aliens
     and fake ID's.

89 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 89 
     John enters his bedroom and closes the door. We see how
     dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch
     is covered in notes, photos, maps, and various writings. He
     studies it as he bites into a sandwich.

90 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 90 
     John and Luke walk near the front of the group of visitors
     toward the visitation rooms.

     Just ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the
     elevator. John stops near the elevator and kneels, pulling
     one of Luke's shoelaces loose.

 LUKE                 It was already tied.

     John reties the lace as the group moves on.    He keeps one
     eye on the elevator.

     The door opens and the guard   steps in - and John notices two
     WORKMEN in hardhats inside.    The elevator closes, the shoelace
     is tied, the group has moved   on down the hall and they are
     alone. John pulls the laces    and unties Luke's shoe.

 LUKE (CONT'D)                 You untied it again!                                           

 (CONTINUED) 33. 
90 CONTINUED: 90 
     The guard looks back, now impatient. John offers a smile
     and throws a look down at the elevator tread, sees the name:
     OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY. Suddenly a voice comes from behind:

 WOMAN'S VOICE                   Mr. Brennan?

     Startled, John turns to see DR. LIFSON.

 DR. LIFSON                   We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.

 JOHN                   Oh, sorry.    Hello, Doctor.

 DR. LIFSON                       (to approaching guard)
                  I'll bring them back myself.                              

91 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CLINIC -- DAY 91 
     John leaves Luke playing and steps into the office. Lifson             
     partially closes the door, so John can still see his son.              

 DR. LIFSON                   We check your wife's blood regularly.
                  She's been refusing her insulin. I
                  don't want to sound dramatic, but
                  it's just another form of suicide.

 JOHN                   I'll talk to her.

 DR. LIFSON                   If she doesn't --                                         

 JOHN                   I'll talk to her.                                         
                      (steps out)                                           
                  Let's go, Squirrel.                                       

92 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 92 
     John and Luke wait. The prisoners enter.      Lara looks
     terrible. John stands and embraces her.

 JOHN                   Hey. Are you alright?                                     

 LARA                   I'm fine.    I'm fine.



 (CONTINUED) 34. 
92 CONTINUED: 92 
     Lara smiles to cover and bends down and kisses her son, who
     is engrossed in his toys as usual.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?

     He doesn't respond. She kisses him on the head then takes a
     seat. John sits beside her. They speak in whispers.

 JOHN                   The doctor told me about the insulin.

 LARA                       (watching Luke)
                  Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.

 JOHN                   You forgot?    For how many days?

 LARA                   I forgot, okay? I have things on my
                  mind.

 JOHN                   --And so much to do.

 LARA                   Oh, that's nice.

 JOHN                   Why are you doing this?

 LARA                   Can I please just watch him play?
                  Tell me about kindergarten.

 JOHN                   No.   I need you to --

 LARA                   Fine, I won't forget again, okay?
                      (trying to fight away these
                       thoughts:)
                  I am just never going to walk him to
                  school or wash his clothes or make
                  him dinner...and I don't know how I
                  can live knowing that. Okay?

 JOHN                   Lara. Look at me. Something will
                  happen. I promise.



 (CONTINUED) 35. 
92 CONTINUED: (2) 92 
 LARA                       (cruelly - but hushed)
                  What? What is going to happen?
                  There are no more appeals, there are
                  no more anything. Exactly what
                  miracle are we hoping for, John?

     He looks down, beaten.      She lets go of her anger.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   I need you to do something for me.

 JOHN                   Sure.

 LARA                   Stop bringing him.                                         

 JOHN                   Come on...

 LARA                   He hates coming here.   Look at him.

 JOHN                   Lara....

 LARA                   Please. It's not his fault. It's                           
                  too hard to watch him forget me.

     John looks at his son, playing at a distance, his back to
     them. It's hard to argue with her, she's right.

 LARA (CONT'D)                   You want to hear something funny?

 JOHN                   Yes.    Anything.

 LARA                   My mother tried to send me anti-aging
                  cream.

     John smiles, but like hers it may be the saddest smile in
     the world. They sit and watch Luke play.

93 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 93 
     John checks his bank statements and adds them up on the wall
     under MONEY. The total is $8,840.00.

     He stares at that figure for a moment.

94 INT. REALTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY 94 
     EUGENIE, the REAL ESTATE AGENT, walks John to the door.

 EUGENIE                 You're sure that you don't want a
                lawn sign?

 JOHN                 I'm very sure. Thanks.                                      

95 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY 95 
     A STUDENT shows John how to use Photoshop to enlarge and
     crop a photo.

96 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 96 
     John uses Photoshop, looking through family pictures for an
     appropriate one to use for Lara's ID. Some of them are of
     the family at a cottage. He finds one that will work and
     starts to crop himself and Luke (as a baby) out of the photo.
     Then he turns and notices Luke standing behind him, staring
     at the screen.

97 EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY 97 
     A helicopter swoops over a bridge and traces the Monongahela
     River through the city. On the door of the helicopter is
     emblazoned the name of a local tour company.

98 INT. HELICOPTER -- DAY 98 
     John sits among six other passengers.

 COPTER PILOT                 On the left, Allegheny County Jail.
                Built in 1995, it is now the largest                        
                jail in the world. There have been                          
                three escape attempts. No one's                             
                made it out alive. On your right...                         

     Everyone else looks to the right as the pilot continues.
     John stays fixed on the left window.

 HIS POINT OF VIEW: 
     The massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly
     what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread
     hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a
     bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof.
 37. 


99 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CLASSROOM -- DAY 99 
      LYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his
      desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google
      Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle.
      John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed
      color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the
      outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR.

 LYLA                  On the first landing, which was as
                 small as the necessary turn of the
                 stairs allowed, there was a niche in
                 the column, about a yard wide, and
                 in this niche the prince felt
                 convinced that a man stood concealed.
                 He thought he could distinguish a
                 figure standing there.

100 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 100 
      John searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS. Clicks on
      one that reads EXPERIENCED HELICOPTER PILOT, COMBAT VET,
 WILL CONSIDER ANY OFFER. 
 ANGLE ON JOHN'S WALL 
      Where a magazine clipping of a helicopter sits under the
      heading ESCAPE. Overlapping it he pins trimmed print-outs
      of several PILOT candidates.

      Directly underneath is the Google Earth photo of the rooftop
      of the jail, the door marked with an arrow, and the landing
      site indicated with an X in a circle.

      Below that is a rough sketch of the visitor's room and the
      adjacent corridor with an arrow marking the elevator. In
      block letters beside it is the word "KEY?"

101 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 101 
      Luke, John and George stand in the foyer, Luke with his child-
      sized, brightly-colored overnight bag. John pulls off Luke's
      coat, kisses him on the head and looks up at George.

 JOHN                  Thanks.

      George nods, takes Luke's hand and walks to the kitchen.
 38. 


102 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 102 
      John drives, taking note of the corners where young men hang
      out, selling drugs or contraband.

103 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 103 
      John walks up to a guy leaning on the bumper of his car, the            
      trunk partially open. Call him MOUSS.                                   

 JOHN                  Adderall?

 MOUSS                  Ten apiece, five for forty.

      John hands him a twenty, Mouss digs into a bag in his trunk             
      and hands him a blister-pack strip of two pills, samples.               

 JOHN                  I need some passports.

 MOUSS                  Piss off.

      John nods and walks back across the street.   The guy watches.

104 INT. CAR -- NIGHT 104 
      John climbs into his car and tosses the pills onto the
      passenger seat, among a half dozen others. There is a sharp
      RAP on his window; Mouss. John rolls down the window.

 MOUSS                  You have to pay up front.

 JOHN                  I can do that.

 MOUSS                  You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?

 JOHN                  No.

 MOUSS                  Ask for Harv.

 JOHN                  What's your name?

 MOUSS                  Just say Mouss.

105 EXT. UPTOWN LOUNGE - 5TH AVENUE -- NIGHT 105 
      John parks and steps out of his car.

106 INT. UPTOWN LOUNGE -- NIGHT 106 
      Hip-hop blares, the clientele are low-lives, John doesn't
      exactly fit in as he enters and orders. His words are drowned
      out. The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for
      "Hart." The bartender nods to a man at the back who is
      playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED             
      GUY at the bar who watches him. John approaches HARV.                   

 JOHN                  Mouss said to come see you.

 HARV                  He did, did he? What do you want?                            

 JOHN                  Three passports, a driver's license,
                 and real social security number.

 HARV                  How do you know Mouss?

 JOHN                  He babysits my kid.

 HARV                      (sizes him up, then:)                                    
                 Okay.                                                        

      Harv gives him a look; nods for him to follow.                          

107 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - PARKING LOT BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT 107 
      They step out the back door.

 HARV                  You have the photos on you?

 JOHN                  Yes.   How much?

 HARV                  Fifteen hundred.

      MOUSS steps out of the shadows and cracks John across the
      back of the head with a pipe. John stumbles to the ground.

      The two men kick the shit out of John.   John tries to protect
      his face; they just keep kicking.

107 CONTINUED: 107 
      Mouss finally grabs John's hair and flicks a knife in his
      face as Harv searches his pockets and finds his money.

 MOUSS                    I ever see you again, you lose an                            
                   eye.                                                         

      The two men walk away and get into Mouss' van. John lies
      doubled up on the ground and eventually tries to stand.

108 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM -- NIGHT 108 
      John cleans the cuts on his face with peroxide, adds a Band-

110 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 110

111 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER -- CONTINUOUS 111 
      John limps to the front door and opens it to see Eugenie,
      his realtor, standing with a nice couple. They see his face,
      try and hide their reactions.

 EUGENIE                    You did remember I was showing the
                   house?

 JOHN                    Give me two minutes.

112 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 112

 EUGENIE                    It really is a great neighborhood.

114 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 114 
      Grace, John's mother, opens the door and sees John's face.


 (CONTINUED) 41.

 GRACE                    Oh, my lord!     What happened?

115 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- DAY 115 
      John sits as Grace approaches with iodine and cotton balls.
      Through the window he sees Luke playing with the dog.

 JOHN                    It was stupid, I fell off the bike.

 GRACE                    The bike that's been in our garage
                   for two years? Put your head back.

 JOHN                    Some guy made a crack about Lara.

 GRACE                    So, that's what you do now: punch
                   everyone who thinks she's guilty?

 JOHN                    What's that supposed to mean?

 GRACE                    It means it's important what YOU
                   believe, not --

 JOHN                    Really?   So, what do you believe,
                   Mom?

      John stands and opens the back door.

 GRACE                    Why are you trying to start a fight?

 JOHN                        (calling out back door)
                   Come on, buddy!
                       (to his mother)
                   Where is his bag?

 GRACE                    Why are you doing this?!

      Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears.

 JOHN                    No reason. I just stupidly thought
                   people who loved her would actually
                   believe she's innocent. My mistake.

 (CONTINUED) 42. 
115 CONTINUED: 115 
 GRACE                    Stop this!

      John turns and sees GEORGE standing in the open doorway. He
      has heard everything. He gives his son a dismissive look
      and walks off towards his bedroom. John feels like a heel.

 JOHN                        (to Luke)
                   Give Grandma a kiss.

      Luke does, and the two of them leave with his bag.

116 EXT. GRACE & GEORGE'S - INSIDE THE PRIUS -- DAY 116 
      John gets in and checks his mirror.   Luke is staring at him.           

 LUKE                    Does your face hurt?

 JOHN                    A little.

 LUKE                    Did you hit him back?

 JOHN                    No.

 LUKE                    That's okay.

      John pulls away.                                                        

117 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 117 
      John drives, looking for someone selling fake papers. He
      sees Mouss' parked car and slows; Mouss stares at him. John             
      flashes his middle finger and drives on. Mouss considers                
      doing something but just flips him off.

118 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - ANOTHER INTERSECTION -- NIGHT 118 
      John asks a couple of guys on the corner about papers and is
      turned away. As he returns to his car, he doesn't notice
      MIKE, the long-haired guy from Drake's Bar, watching from
      astride his motorcycle. A SECOND RIDER pulls up beside Mike.
      John pulls out and the motorcycles follow at a distance.

119 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 119 
      John watches Jenna leave; closes the door, climbs the stairs.

120 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 120

      doorbell rings.

121 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT 121 
      John peers out surreptitiously, sees MIKE standing there.                    
      He rings the bell again.                                                     

      John runs and snatches a kitchen knife, returns to the door,
      secures the chain lock and opens the door a crack.

 JOHN                  What?

      Mike speaks in a loud, atonal and unnerving voice.

 MIKE                  I was at the bar.    I know what you
                 are looking for.

      Caught off guard by the voice, John just stares at him.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                  I'm deaf, you idiot. I read lips.

      John stares at him, unsure what to do.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                  You really want to talk out here?

      John puts the knife in his back pocket and steps out onto...

122 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 122 
      John tries to look tough.     Mike smiles at John's bravado.

 MIKE                  What do you need?

      John indicates Mike should lower his voice.

 JOHN                  Three passports, a driver's license
                 and social security number that can
                 take a credit check.

 MIKE                  Thirty seven hundred.

 JOHN                  That's too much.

 (CONTINUED) 44. 
122 CONTINUED: 122 
 MIKE                    It is if you never get them. I need
                   photos and a thousand in advance.

      John stares at the man, trying to read him.       He turns.

123 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 123 
      John pulls cash and an envelope from his jacket pocket.

124 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER -- NIGHT 124 
      Mike counts the money and shoves it in his breast pocket.

 MIKE                    I'll bring them Wednesday.

 JOHN                    Not here.   Don't come here again.

      Mike stares at him.      John stares back.

 MIKE                    Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
                   Under the bridge; two o'clock. If
                   I'm not there on time, leave.

      John closes the door behind him and watches Mike walk off
      toward his motorcycle.

125 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 125 
      He drops the carving knife back in the drawer. As he looks
      up, he sees THE SECOND RIDER staring in the window, his helmet
      still on. John's heart almost stops. The rider DRIVES OFF.

126 EXT. STREET - UNDER A BRIDGE -- DAY 126 
      A beat-up old van sits parked on the crumbling sidewalk.                   
      John hands seven hundred dollars to a sketchy-looking guy                  
      inside. The guy hands John a 9MM handgun wrapped in a                      
      oilcloth. John unwraps it and hands it back.                               

 JOHN                    Show me how to load it.

127 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN -- EVENING 127 
      John and Luke enter the back door. Luke automatically heads

 JOHN                    No video game.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    Dad!

      John moves to check the answering machine.

 JOHN                    I'll play checkers with you after
                   dinner.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    You'll just lose again.

 EUGENIE (V.O.)                        (on voicemail:)
                   John? It's Eugenie. You're not
                   going to believe it; the people I
                   brought over? They made an offer!
                   I'll bring it in the morning.

 BEEP. 
 JOHN                        (buoyed/to Luke)
                   Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly                            
                   destroy you.                                               

128 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 128 
      John watches a video on YouTube: "How to unlock any door."
      The person on screen demonstrates how to make a "bump key."

 KID ON SCREEN                    -- a bump key. First, find any key                         
                   that fits into the same make of lock.                      

129 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 129

133 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - ELEVATOR -- DAY 133 
      John gets in, heading up to his classroom. People avoid
      looking at his face. One woman can't help noticing. John
      nods and smiles. He pushes the elevator button and notices
      the name: OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY.

134 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 134 
      John scans the room as he waits. Two children play in the
      set that is used to teach them how to speak to a prisoner
      behind glass using a phone. A moment later, a woman enters
      with a large shoulder bag. She is a NOTARY.

 NOTARY                  Mr. Brennan?

135 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- MORNING 135 
      No other visitors today.     A NOTARY sits with Lara and John.

 NOTARY                  And just put your thumb there.

      And Lara puts her thumb print on the book.

 NOTARY (CONT'D)                  Thanks, that's all I need.

      The notary heads for the door.     John turns to the female
      guard who is waiting.

 JOHN                  I'll just be a moment.

      He turns back to his wife.

 LARA                      (touching him, melting)
                 Your poor face. How could you do
                 that to yourself?

 JOHN                  I am useless without you.    I can't
                 even ride a bike.

 LARA                  I think it's very sexy.

 JOHN                  I'm sorry we had to do this.

135 CONTINUED: 135 
 LARA                    You have nothing to apologize for.
                   But you should have told me before
                   this.

 JOHN                    I know.

 LARA                    I don't want you not telling me
                   things.

 JOHN                    From now on I will.

 LARA                        (beat)
                   I won't know where to picture you.
                       (off his look)
                   I close my eyes and I see Luke in
                   his bedroom, you on the sofa by the
                   Window. I won't know where to picture
                   you anymore.

136 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY 136 
      John stares at his laptop as the class does a test. Knowing
      he isn't paying attention, a STUDENT angles his multiple
      choice test so that his friend behind can see the answers.

137 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CORRIDOR -- DAY 137 
      John waits for the janitor to leave his tiny office and grabs
      the door before it closes. He slips inside and finds a rack
      with keys. He takes one from the hook marked ELEVATORS.

138 INT. BRENNAN'S GARAGE -- NIGHT 138 
      John files down the elevator key as he did the house key.

139 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- DAY 139 
      John moves aside a box on the shelf and removes the handgun,
      wrapped in an old chamois.

 PAULA (O.S.)                    John?

      He turns to see Paula standing in the open garage door.

 JOHN                    Hi.

139 CONTINUED: 139 
      John tries to look casual as he stands with the thinly
      disguised gun in his hand.

 PAULA                    I was wondering if I could ask you
                   to water my plants next week; I'm
                   going in for an operation.

 JOHN                    I hope it's nothing serious.

 PAULA                    My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me.
                   He's blaming the lab; the lab's
                   blaming him. But I'll be fine.
                   Thanks.

      And she walks off.    John gets in the car and slips the gun
      between the seats.

140 INT. PRIUS -- DAY 140 
      John pulls into the empty parking lot beside Don's and waits.
      Checks his watch: 1:49 PM. A car pulls in. The guy sits
      there for a second, then gets out and enters the restaurant.

141 INT. PRIUS -- DAY 141 
      John checks his watch. 2:14. He looks around, knowing he
      is supposed to leave. He makes a call.

 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)                    English Department, this is Catherine.

 JOHN                    Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling
                   well, I'm going to take him home. I
                   need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.

 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)                    I will let him know.

142 INT. PRIUS - DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON 142 
      John checks his watch: 2:27. His cell phone rings, displays
      the name MICK; John presses IGNORE. He feels for the gun                    
      between the seats.

143 EXT. DON'S PARKING LOT - MANCHESTER -- AFTERNOON 143 
      The guy comes out of the restaurant. John watches him walk
      to his car. The man sees him and stares back. John checks
      his watch. 2:45. The guy drives off, leaving the lot empty.

      John presses the VOICEMAIL button on his phone.

 MICK (V.O.)                    Are you ever going to answer your
                   goddamn phone?

      Suddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John
      realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand
      goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the
      SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window.

 MIKE                    You were supposed to leave.

 JOHN                    I need them.

 MIKE                    You notice that guy was a cop?

 JOHN                    Which guy?

 MIKE                    The one with the red light in his
                   back window.

      John feels ridiculous.       Mike hands him the documents.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                    Just give me the money.

      John hands him the envelope of money.       Mike checks it.

 MIKE (CONT'D)                    You want this too much. You're going
                   to fuck it up.

      Mike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and
      follows. John looks over the passports with their new names.

144 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE -- AFTERNOON 144 
      Luke gets out of the car and heads into the house, swinging
      his lunch pale. John watches him go, then reaches down beside
      his seat and pulls out the gun, wrapped in a cloth. He hides
      it in the garage and thinks about what he is doing.

145 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 145 
      John moves through the line toward the metal detector. He
      takes his key ring out of his pocket and slips it, and the
      separate elevator bump key, into a white plastic dish and

145 CONTINUED: 145 
      places it atop the X-ray machine. He steps through the metal
      detector and then grabs the plastic dish before the guard can
      get to it. He hands the dish to the guard.

 JOHN                    How are you doing today?

 GUARD                    Don't touch that.

 JOHN                    Sorry.

      John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone --
      John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the
      counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors.

      JOHN pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail.

146 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 146 
      John moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors.
      He eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard
      ahead. By the time the group stops for the door ahead to
      open, John's managed to be right beside the elevator.

      He folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing
      and feels for the slot. Finding it, he slips in the bump
      key. It fits.

      The guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting
      room and the crowd starts moving again. John quickly bumps
      the key and turns it -- but it won't turn. He bumps it again.
      Visitors keep moving past him.

      He looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is
      preoccupied at the door.

      He turns it harder. Nothing.     He tries to pull it out.
      It's stuck. John panics.

      The rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd.

      John tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and
      snaps it off in the lock. A BLACK WOMAN among the visitors
      sees what he is doing but averts her eyes.

      John drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the
      slot between the elevator and the shaft. He slips back into
      the crowd and moves on.

      Near the rear of the crowd now, John approaches the door to
      the visiting room.

 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 51. 
146 CONTINUED: 146 
      He throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to
      insert his key in the elevator.

      John rounds the corner into the visiting room. The camera
      stays on his face until we finally hear A DEAFENING ALARM.

147 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ANOTHER CORRIDOR -- DAY 147 
      John waits in a line against the wall, beside a door to a
      small office. Through the glass he watches the MAJOR
      interview the black woman who noticed what he was doing.
      She nods and leaves, passing him with a look. The Major
      holds the door open for him.

148 INT. MAJOR'S OFFICE -- A SHORT TIME LATER 148 
      The MAJOR plays John the CCTV video from the corridor. He
      flips between two camera positions at either end of the hall.
      The crowd of visitors shuffling toward the visiting rooms
      obscures the view of the elevator.

 MAJOR                    So, you are where in here?

 JOHN                    ...In the middle there.

 MAJOR                    In the middle. Can you point to
                   yourself?

 JOHN                        (looks)
                   It's hard to tell.   I think that's
                   me there. Why?

      He freezes the tape and points to a blurry figure in the
      background.

 MAJOR                    So that's not you there.   By the
                   elevator?

 JOHN                        (looks)
                   ....No.
                       (points to another person)
                   I was over here. You want to tell
                   me what's going on?

 MAJOR                    You want me to tell you?


 (CONTINUED) 52. 
148 CONTINUED: 148 
 JOHN                    Yes.

      The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock.

 MAJOR                    You know what a bump key is?

 JOHN                    Sorry.

      Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John.    Finally:

 MAJOR                    If this was you, you might want to
                   think about what's going to happen
                   to your kids if both of their parents
                   are in prison.

      The major stares right through him.

149 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY 149 
      John heads toward the exit, accompanied by a guard. As he
      nears the elevator he sees a technician climbing a step
      ladder, holding a new CCTV camera.

150 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY 150 
      Face chalk white, John heads for the exit, fighting the urge
      to run. The door opens just before he gets there and Collero
      steps in, Quinn holding the door for her. John charges past,
      noticing neither of them -- but Quinn recognizes him. Quinn
      turns and watches as John doubles over the short wall nearby
      and vomits.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    -- The worst date you've ever been
                   on? This was worse. And this guy?                           
                   He really thinks he is doing great.                         
                   Then he's driving me home and I know                        
                   he's going to try and kiss me, so I
                   pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm
                   actually snoring, right in his car.                         
                   Does that stop him?                                         

      John turns and notices Quinn, behind the door, watching him.
      They lock eyes. Collero realizes that Quinn isn't paying
      attention and wonders what he's looking at.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)                    ...What?


 (CONTINUED) 53. 
150 CONTINUED: 150 
      John turns and walks away.     Quinn keeps watching.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    Did I tell you not to date cops?

      Collero's eyes find John as well.      He disappears around the
      corner.

151 INT. T-TRAIN -- DAY 151 
      John rides home, devastated that his plan has failed, and
      wondering what he will do. He checks over his shoulder to
      make sure he isn't being followed.

152 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- DAY 152 
      John sits on the bare wood floor of the living room. His
      head turns as he hears someone POUNDING on the front door.
      He throws a look to the garage, thinks about the gun;
      dismisses the idea. Then he hears the voice: his brother.

 MICK (O.S.)                    Let me in, asshole!!

153 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH -- CONTINUOUS 153 
      Mick bangs again.                                                          

 MICK (O.S.)                    Open up!
                       (more banging)
                   Your car is in the garage, I know
                   you're in there!

154 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 154 
      John doesn't move. As we pull back we see that the living
      room and dining room have been stripped of every bit of
      furniture, save an old TV set sitting on a box. John knows
      he can't let his brother see this.

      The MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door
      and looks out and scowls.

 MALE NEIGHBOR                    What's your problem? He's not home!

 MICK                    Not home?   So you're saying I'm blind?

 MALE NEIGHBOR                    No, I'm saying you're an idiot.

      Mick pounds on the door aggressively.      Then just gives up.                

 MICK                    You know what? You're right.    I am
                   an idiot.

      And he walks off to his car.

155 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 155 
      John leans back against the wall, in the middle of the bare
      room, and listens to his brother's car start and drive away.

158 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING 158 
      John stands, staring at his wall, now a vast collage, layer
      upon layer of photographs and notes. And no answers.

 LUKE (O.S.)                    ...Dad?

159 EXT. PARK -- DAY 159 
      John sits on a bench, frustrated and lost.      Luke trots up.

 LUKE                    Can I have my cookies?

 JOHN                    You hungry?    You want your sandwich?

 LUKE                    No.

      John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands
      them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting
      a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention.

 NICOLE                    Carrie!
                       (to John)
                   I'm sorry. She just already has it
                   all figured out.
                       (John nods awkwardly)
                   Nicole.

 JOHN                    I remember.

 JOHN                        (smiles and admits)
                   I remember your daughter.

 NICOLE                    She's hard to forget.
                       (digs in her bag)
                   Oh, this is for you. Luke was
                   supposed to bring it home.

      Hands him an envelope. He opens it and sees a birthday
      invitation with jungle animals on the cover.

 JOHN                    He has his father's memory.

 NICOLE                    It's for Carrie's birthday party.                              
                   Please come; I'd love to meet your                             
                   wife.

 JOHN                    I'm afraid she can't be there.
                   ...It's complicated.

 NICOLE                    I understand. With me, too. Carrie,
                   come on, time for lunch.
                       (to John)
                   We're going to the cafe on the corner,
                   would you like to join us?

 JOHN                    Oh, we're pretty...you know....

 NICOLE                    Busy?

      John smiles, busted.

 NICOLE (CONT'D)                    Come on, we owe you for the cookies.

 JOHN                    That's true.     And I made those
                   cookies.

 NICOLE                    And learned how to pre-package them.

      They walk toward the street, the kids trailing behind.
      Neither John nor Nicole speak for a moment.

 NICOLE                    Do you trade off time with Luke?

 JOHN                    No. Luke and I are together full
                   time.

 NICOLE                    Wow. I guess that's why I see you
                   so much.

 JOHN                    She'd like nothing better than to be
                   here. With him. Lara. She really
                   misses...all this.

 NICOLE                    I guess it's all about priorities,
                   isn't it?

 JOHN                    No.  She's not like that.   She'd...

 NICOLE                    Oh.

 JOHN                    I don't tell most people.

 NICOLE                    I understand.

 JOHN                    She's innocent. She didn't kill the
                   woman.

 NICOLE                    ...Good.   I mean, I'm sure she didn't.

 NICOLE                    That would be great.

      John heads back and scoops up Luke.       Nicole watches, trying
      not to look dumbfounded.

160 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON 160 
      John and Luke enter, John sorting through the mail.      Nothing            
      from Lara.

161 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 161 
      John finishes writing a letter on lined paper. He opens his
      drawer; it is full of letters in yellow envelopes. He pulls
      one out; it is from Lara, on lined paper. He stuffs his new
      letter in the old yellow envelope.

162 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 162 
      This is the only room that is still furnished. John pokes
      his head in, sees Luke on his bed playing by himself.

 JOHN                    You want to read a letter from Mom?

      Luke shrugs as if he doesn't care, but then scoots over in
      his bed so that his dad can sit beside him. John does. He
      pulls the letter out of the envelope and reads.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As
                   Much As Chocolate...

 LUKE                    She didn't write that.

 JOHN                    My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I
                   love so, so much. I wish I could

163 EXT. PAULA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON 163 
       Luke and John water Paula's vegetable garden.

 LUKE                   But what's wrong with her?

 JOHN                   She's not feeling well.

 LUKE                   Why didn't she just stay home?

 JOHN                   Because sometimes people get so sick
                  you have to go to the hospital to
                  get fixed.

 LUKE                   How do you know when you're that
                  sick?

 JOHN                   The doctors do tests.

       Something tweaks. John turns and looks back across the alley,
       at his open garage...and remembers their conversation. He
       drops the hose and takes Luke's hand.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                   Come on.

       They drop the hose in the garden and walk back to the house.

163A INT. JOHN AND LARA'S BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 163A 
       John flings open the medicine cabinet, finds an old bottle

      from a medical laboratory.

165 EXT. COUNTY JAIL -- MORNING 165 
      Parked at a distance, John watches from inside his Prius.

167 EXT. NURSING HOME -- DAY 167 
      John watches as the driver steps out with a tray, point and
      push his key fob, lock the doors and enter the nursing home.

      John checks no one is watching, places the tennis ball over
      the key slot and punches the ball flat. The lock pops open.

      John finds the envelope marked "Lara Brennan." He checks
      his watch, only 44 seconds have lapsed. He slips the card
      out, photographs it with his cell phone and puts it back.

176 EXT. MEDICAL FACILITY -- DAY 176 
      The driver heads for the van as John opens the back door and
      climbs out. Oblivious to his narrow escape, John closes the
      door and walks away a heartbeat before the driver gets there.

177 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- EVENING 177 
      John checks his son, who sits on the bare living room floor
      playing a video game on the TV, the remaining item.

 JOHN                  You okay?

      Luke nods and shoots somebody.

178 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- EVENING 178 
      John brings up Lara's form in Photoshop on his laptop and
      erases the hand-written numbers in the test results boxes.

179 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 179 
      John writes numbers in the blank boxes of the medical form.
      Then he sits back and worries that he's got it right. Calls:

 JOHN                  Luke!   Time for bed.

180 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- NIGHT 180 
      John enters the child's bedroom and stops dead.

      The wall over Luke's bed is covered with crayon scribbles,
      imitating the chart on his father's bedroom walls.



 (CONTINUED) 61. 
180 CONTINUED: 180 
      Luke walks into the room, and steps up beside his father,
      staring at the wall. He takes his father's hand, and the
      two just stand there in silence.

181 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- DAY 181 
      John waits as the other prisoners enter. Lara kisses him;                         
      looks in his eyes. He sees the despair behind the smile.                          

 JOHN                    ...What's wrong?

      She takes a letter from her pocket.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    What is it?

      She hands it to him.       John reads.   His face changes.                        

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    No....NO! They can't move you. Not
                   without notice! Monday isn't notice!                                 

 LARA                    I was only here through the appeal.                                  
                   We knew I'd be moved to a prison.                                    

 JOHN                    Muncy is the other side of the state.                                

      Lara nods. Off John's face, the screen goes BLACK.           Read:                

 THE LAST THREE DAYS 
182 INT. REALTOR'S OFFICE -- DAY 182 
      John stands with Eugenie, the frightened realtor.

 JOHN                    I don't have two weeks!     I need it                                
                   tomorrow!                                                            

 EUGENIE                    The title hasn't been cleared --
                   there is no way that --

 JOHN                    How much can they give me?!

 EUGENIE                    Nothing!

      John turns on his heel and slams out through the door.
 62. 


183 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY 183 
      John stares at the wall -- MONEY is down to $1,497.

      He rifles through a drawer, finds a pair of sunglasses.

      He snatches a baseball cap from a top shelf.

      He tosses a bag on the bed, unzips it and pulls out the gun.              

184 EXT. AIRPORT LONG TERM PARKING LOT -- DAY 184 
      John unscrews the license plate from a dusty black Prius.
      He sticks the plate under his jacket, stands and checks over
      his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot.

185 INT. BANK AND MALL PARKING LOT -- DAY 185 
      A quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor
      mall. The Prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the
      stolen license plate.

      Inside the Prius, John opens the backpack, puts on the hat
      and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. And again he
      looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens
      the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads
      back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to
      work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do
      this.

      Furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs
      up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks.

      A WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out
      of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and
      scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE.

 ELAINE                  What are you doing?!   You almost
                 killed us!

 JOHN                  Are you --?

 ELAINE                  Are you out of your mind?!   You don't
                 look?!

      She stoops to grab the few items that fell.    He tries to
      help.

 JOHN                  I am so sorry --

 (CONTINUED) 63. 
185 CONTINUED: 185 
 ELAINE                    Get away!     Get away from us!

      She stands and runs for her car. John returns to the car
      and sits, leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming.
      He sits there, letting the failure and his disgust for his
      weakness wash over him.

186 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- AFTERNOON 186 
      John sits in the children's area, waiting for the line of
      visitors to get shorter. One look at his face and we can
      see how tortured he is. He has his cell phone to his ear:

 MEYER (O.S.)                    I'm sorry.

 JOHN                    No, it was a long shot.       Thanks.

187 INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 187 
 MEYER                        (into phone)
                   How's Lara?

188 INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- CONTINUOUS 188 
 JOHN                    She's okay.     Thanks, Meyer.

      John hangs up and stands.

189 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- AFTERNOON 189 
      John stands in the corner, staring out through the high,
      thick windows. He turns as he hears Lara and other prisoners
      coming. He tries to smile, but she knows something is wrong.

 LARA                    What's wrong?

 JOHN                    Nothing.

 LARA                    Is it Luke?

 JOHN                    No. He's fine. I had Meyer see
                   what he could do about not getting
                   you moved.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    I told him traveling that distance
                   would be a hardship on us, that Luke
                   was already having trouble at school.
                   Which is true. I haven't been
                   spending enough time with him.

 LARA                    You haven't? YOU haven't? God,
                   John, you are too much. Luke is
                   having a 'hard time' because mommy
                   is in jail for murder, not because
                   daddy doesn't spend enough time with
                   him! Your father was right, you
                   don't live in the same world we do.

 JOHN                        (stung)
                   That's nice, that the two of you
                   talk. What world do I live in, Lara?

 LARA                    I don't know, but it's not the real
                   one. I am in here for the rest of
                   my life! And you want me to believe
                   in some fantasy that -- !

      A guard steps up and raps her knuckles on the table to get
      their attention. Only John looks up.

 FEMALE GUARD                    We good here?

 JOHN                    Yes.   Sorry.

      Lara lowers her voice a little, but not her intensity.    The
      guard walks away under:

 LARA                    Now you come here all long-faced,
                   like you've let me down. What do
                   you want me to do, make you feel
                   better?

 JOHN                    Got it.   I'm sorry.

 LARA                    And now you're apologizing.   You
                   really are a gem.



 (CONTINUED) 65. 
189 CONTINUED: (2) 189 
 JOHN                    What do you want from me?

 LARA                    Nothing. You're too perfect already.
                   You know you never even asked me if
                   I did it. If I killed her.

 JOHN                        (stopped dead)
                   Because I knew you didn't.

 LARA                    Then you'd be wrong.

      She leans forward and whispers in his ear.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I
                   hit her in the face. I heard her
                   neck snap. You know why I did it?
                   Because she pissed me off. I threw
                   her purse in the river. We paid for
                   dinner with the cash from her wallet.

      She sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking
      in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I'm sorry.   I'm actually very sorry.

      She stands. The guard opens the door and lets her into the
      changing room. John watches, unable to breathe.

190 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 190 
      Lara gets one last look at John, through the glass, and then
      disappears behind the partition. She sits on the bench,
      leans her head between her knees, and breaks into shards.

191 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS 191 
      John exits along with all the other visitors, destroyed by
      what he has heard, playing out what she said in his head.
      Then suddenly he just stops. The crowd keeps moving, leaving
      him behind. The guard following the group sees him standing
      there. Commands him:

 GUARD #2                    Sir, you cannot stand there.
                        (beat)
                   SIR, you need to exit the building
 NOW. 66. 


192 INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- MOMENTS LATER 192 
      Lara takes a seat on her side of the glass partition.    She
      picks up her phone and opens her mouth to speak.

 JOHN                  Shut up. I don't care what you say
                 or how you say it. I don't believe
                 you did it and I never will. I know
                 who you are.

      She opens her mouth to object but John slams the phone into
      the cradle. She pounds on the window. He just stares at
      her. Her eyes well up, and she smiles through her tears.

193 INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER 193 
      John steps out and sees the MAJOR waiting with his keys.
      They exchange a look.

 JOHN                  Thank you.

      The Major nods and locks the door.    John heads out.

194 INT. TOY SHOP -- DAY 194 
      Luke in his arms, John takes a My Little Pony off the shelf.                

 JOHN                  You think?

 LUKE                      (already an expert)
                 Girls love them.

195 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY 195 
      Grace opens the door. George stands a few steps behind her,
      quiet. Grace sees John and is immediately concerned.

 JOHN                  Hi Mom.

 GRACE                  What are you doing here?

 JOHN                  I've got class.

 GRACE                  Five o'clock at night?


 (CONTINUED) 67. 
195 CONTINUED: 195 
 JOHN                    Yes.
                          (kisses Luke)
                   Bye.

      Luke runs in as John walks off.

196 EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 196 
      John's father watches through the window as his son leaves.
      In his gut, George knows something is wrong.

197 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 197 
      John sits in his car down the street, watching the corner
      where he noticed kids selling drugs.

      A car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The
      street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an
      exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks
      his watch and settles in to wait.

198 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 198 
      John watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And
      then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks
      his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer
      runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the
      driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to
      call DAVID. He drives away. John follows.

199 EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT 199 
      John follows the flashy car at a distance.    It stops at
      another corner and something is exchanged.    It drives on;
      John follows.

200 EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT 200 
      Not the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill.
      The flashy car parks and David crosses the street.

      Half a block back, John turns left at the corner and then
      makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many
      houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks
      over the fences.

      He stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a
      house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch.
      He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and
      the light goes out again.



 (CONTINUED) WHITE 9-10-09 68. 
200 CONTINUED: 200 
      John inches closer as the back door opens. David exchanges
      a few words with whoever opened it and then packages are
      exchanged. The door closes and David walks off the way he
      came.

      John waits a moment, then moves down the alley, hops the
      fence, and sneaks through the twisted bramble of the back
      yard. He finds a place to hide, on the ground right beside
      the back porch. He pulls out his gun and settles in to wait
      between the trash cans, his heart pounding in his ears.

      Fade to BLACK.      Beat, then:   BANG!   BANG!    BANG!

201 EXT. DRUG DEALER'S BACK YARD -- LATER THAT NIGHT 201 
      John WAKES to HAMMERING on the door. The porch light flicks
      on and John is bathed in bright light -- he didn't realize
      he'd fallen asleep. David stands above him on the porch,
      holding the screen door open -- if he glanced down there is
      no way he wouldn't see him.

      John holds his     breath and waits. The porch light flicks
      off, the locks     are unbolted, and finally the thick door opens.
      As before, the     two exchange words, but now the POUNDING in
      John's ears is     so loud we can barely hear anything else.

      John takes a deep breath and springs to his feet -- knocking
      over the trash cans -- and onto the porch!

      He smacks David with the gun, grabs him by the hair and jams
      him forward into the doorway, preventing the supplier --
      ALEX -- from slamming the door on them.

202 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 202 
      Alex releases his BARKING German shepherd and it immediately
      attacks David, biting his leg. David screams in agony.

 JOHN                        (to Alex)
                   Back up! Get back!

      Suddenly a THUG comes barreling in from the kitchen and aims
      a sawed-off shotgun at John, who keeps himself right behind
      David's head. The dialogue is almost drowned out completely
      by the sound of POUNDING in John's ears and David's SCREAMING.

 ALEX                    -- Shoot them both!

 JOHN                    -- I'll shoot the dog!


 (CONTINUED) 69. 
202 CONTINUED: 202 
 ALEX                    -- Shoot the dog!

 THUG                    -- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!

      John fires into the floor beside the dog.

 ALEX                    -- You want the police here, asshole?!

 JOHN                    -- Good idea!

      John fires two more shots into the floor.

 ALEX                        (to thug)
                   -- Put the gun down!

      The thug obeys, rests it against the wall.

 JOHN                    -- Call the dog off!!   Put it away!

 ALEX                    -- Release!

      The dog stops its attack but goes back to barking.

 JOHN                    -- Put it away!!
                       (aims gun at it)
 PUT IT AWAY!! 
      Alex reluctantly opens a closet door.

 ALEX                    In!   Get in!

      He has to shove the barking dog into the closet.

 JOHN                        (to thug)
                   You, too!

 THUG                    I'm not getting in there!

      John fires into the wall!

 ALEX                    Get in!

 (CONTINUED) 70. 
202 CONTINUED: (2) 202 
      And the thug goes in the closet after the barking dog.            John
      sees the bolt and drives it home, locking the door.

 JOHN                    -- Give me that chair!

      Alex doesn't obey, so David grabs it and hands it to him.
      John props it under the handle of the closet door.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Move!

      He shoves David forward, closer to Alex.

 ALEX                    You're dead.

 DAVID                    I didn't do anything!!

 ALEX                    You brought him!

 DAVID                    I didn't bring him!

 JOHN                    Shut up!

      He pushes them both back into the next room; the dog in the
      closet never stops barking.

203 INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT 203 
      John shoves David to the floor and waves the gun between
      them.

 JOHN                    On your knees! Hands behind your
                   head!

      John catches Alex's eyes darting to the counter. Following
      his gaze he finds Alex's revolver on the counter. John grabs
      it, flips open the cylinder and spills out the cartridges.

 DAVID                    I can't kneel!

 JOHN                    On the floor!

      David kneels with great difficulty.         Alex calmly does as
      he's told, his eyes on John.

 (CONTINUED) 71. 
203 CONTINUED: 203 
      John grabs the paper bag out of Alex's hand and opens it,
      finds a couple thousand in cash.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Where's the rest?

 DAVID                    That's twelve hundred dollars!
                       (emptying his pockets)
                   Here, take it.

      A couple of hundred dollars spill onto the floor.

 JOHN                        (gun on Alex)
                   Where do you keep your money?!

      Alex scoffs, seeing weakness in John.

 ALEX                    Yeah, I'm going to give you my money.

 JOHN                    I'll shoot you!

 ALEX                    You won't even shoot a dog.

 JOHN                    Tell me!

 ALEX                    Shoot the floor again, impress me.

      John pistol-whips him and Alex goes down. John holds his
      gun to his head while he is on the ground bleeding.

 JOHN                    I'm going to kill you both.

 ALEX                    No, I'm going to kill you both.

 DAVID                    Give him your money!

 ALEX                        (to David)
                   Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.

      Enraged, John fires a round into Alex's leg.      Alex screams.

 DAVID                    Stop it!!

 ALEX                        (smiles thru pain)
                   See? You aren't going to kill me.
                   That was the worst you can do. So,
                   now you've done it. Go home. I'll
                   come find you and kill you.

      John looks around desperately. He spots an open bottle of
      tequila in the clutter on the counter. He grabs it and pours
      it on the floor.

 ALEX (CONT'D)                    You're wasting some good shit.

      Now he pours it on Alex.

 JOHN                    Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.

      John smashes the bottle on the floor; tequila goes everywhere.

 THUG (O.S.)                    What's going on?! Let me out!

 ALEX                    You going to burn me out?

      John lights a rag as the thug in the closet continues to
      yell and pound. Now calmly:

 JOHN                    Yeah.    That's what I'm going to do.

 DAVID                    Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.

 JOHN                    Your money.

 ALEX                        (no longer smiling)
                   This is a meth lab, you idiot!

 JOHN                    No.    It was.

      And he tosses the burning rag at the smashed bottle.        David
      screams as the room explodes in flames.

 ALEX                        (suddenly desperate)
                   My kid is upstairs!!

 JOHN                    -- What??

 ALEX MY KID!! 
      Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned,
      John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the
      gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.

 DAVID                    Let me go!!

 JOHN                    Get up there!!

      John pushes him up the stairs as a shield, following the
      trail of blood.

 DAVID                    The house is going to explode!

 ANGLE ON BACK DOOR 
      Fire spreads, the thug yells, the dog barks. The shotgun
      leans against the wall where the thug left it. The closet
      door rocks as the thug kicks. The chair won't give way.

204 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT 204 
      John moves David quickly up the stairs in front of him and
      down the hall. They peer into one room, nothing. Into the
      next - what is clearly a CHILD'S ROOM.

      Alex kneels on the far side of the room, barely visible behind
      the small bed, his back to us.

      Until he wheels, gun in hand, and FIRES twice.

      A bullet strikes David in the chest, the second grazes John's
      side. Both men are knocked back into the hall and onto the
      floor. John pulls himself out from under David as...

      Running on adrenaline, Alex stands and strides forward.
      David looks up at him. Alex shoots him again and steps over
      him into the hall. He sees John, raises his weapon and....

      John fires twice, hits Alex in the chest, knocking him down.


 (CONTINUED) 74. 
204 CONTINUED: 204 
      John stands. Alex lies dead, sprawled over David.   David
      looks around through the roiling smoke:

 JOHN                    Is anyone up here?!

      He steps over Alex and into the room. He checks the closet --
      empty of clothes; clearly no child lives here. John turns
      to where Alex was kneeling, sees a bureau pushed aside, a
      safe crudely installed in the wall lying open, a trash bag
      on the floor half-filled with cash.

      John drops to his knees and shovels the remaining cash into
      the trash bag.

205 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- CONTINUOUS 205 
      The dog barks; the door SPLINTERS.

206 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 206 
      John steps over the bodies; sees David looking up at him.

 DAVID                    Don't leave me. I don't want to
                   burn. Don't let me burn.

      The hall is now thick with smoke. John stares terrified at
      the two men, one dead, one dying, and agonizes over what he
      knows is a mistake. Cut to BLACK.

207 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - BACK HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 207 
      John carries David past the closet just as the thug's boot
      kicks a hole in the door. Cut to BLACK.

208 EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 208 
      John, bleeding himself, shoves the badly wounded dealer into
      the back seat. He throws the trash bag into the passenger
      seat and slams the door closed behind him. Not even a
      heartbeat later THE GERMAN SHEPHERD leaps up and snaps at
      the partially open window. John struggles to get the car
      turned on and the window up as THE DOG tries to force his
      way into the car.

      Through the front windshield he sees THE THUG leap over the
      back fence, landing sprawled in the alley with the shotgun.

      John jams the car into reverse and backs away -- the man in
      the back seat screaming for his life, the dog chasing the
      car, the thug getting off a shot.
 75. 


209 EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS 209 
      John swerves wide around the corner, hitting a fire hydrant
      and shattering a taillight.

210 INT. PRIUS - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS 210 
      John slams the transmission into Drive and speeds off down
      the street.

      The dog barking disappears. All that's left are the sounds
      of the dying man. John keeps throwing looks over his
      shoulder.

 DAVID                  I don't want to die.   I don't want
                 to die.

      Now at a safe distance, John pulls over and looks into the
      back seat. We don't have to see the body to know he's dead.

      John sits there a moment, listening to the sounds of
      approaching fire engines. He catches a glimpse of himself
      in the rearview mirror before pulling out. Cut to BLACK.                  

211 EXT. BUS STOP -- NIGHT 211 
      John's car idles at the curb, his back door sits open. He
      steps back into shot from the far side of the Prius, closes
      the door and gets in. As he drives away we see David's body
      lying on the bench, waiting to be discovered.

212 INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - TOILET -- NIGHT 212 
      Standing at the sink shirtless, John pours alcohol on the
      wound in his side.

      He mops up the blood with a wad of paper towels, then applies
      a bandage, fresh from the box. He pulls a new shirt and
      jacket from a Target bag.

      A moment later, now dressed, John stuffs the trash bag full
      of cash into his backpack.

213 INT. FAST FOOD JOINT -- NIGHT 213 
      John steps out of the bathroom, zipping his new jacket. He
      barely draws a look from the few customers as he limps out
      of the restaurant. Cut to BLACK.
 76. 


214 EXT. ALEX'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 214 
      Water streams from the house, the front door and windows
      broken by firemen who now pack up their gear to leave.
      LIEUTENANT NABULSI strides into shot, drinking a Red Bull,
      which he crushes and discards on the porch.

215 INT. ALEX'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS 215 
      Nabulsi climbs the stairs to find SGT. HARRIS watching the
      CSI team work. Nabulsi steps up behind the CSI worker.                    

 LT. NABULSI                      (almost a whisper)
                 Get out of my way.

      The man flees like he just saw the prince of darkness.
      Nabulsi cocks his head and looks down at the dead man.

 LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)                  What do we have?

 SGT. HARRIS                  A miracle. Meth lab in the basement,
                 the house still standing. Should be
                 just a crater.

 LT. NABULSI                      (straddles Alex)
                 Do we know him?

 SGT. HARRIS                  Alex Gaidar, history of violence and
                 drug trafficking.

      Nabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room.

 LT. NABULSI                  He have a kid?

 SGT. HARRIS                  Neighbor said wife left with him
                 last year. Big surprise there.

 LT. NABULSI                  They type all this blood yet?

 SGT. HARRIS                  No, but someone left through the back
                 door bleeding. Zone Three found a
                 gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.

      Nabulsi nods and descends the stairs.
 77. 


216 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- NIGHT 216 
      John snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns
      and walks back to the Prius.

217 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 217 
      John eases open his parents' front door and removes his key
      from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is
      surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters,
      carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair.
      When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas,
      reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea.

 JOHN                  Hi.    What are you doing up?

      George shrugs.     An uncomfortable silence.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                  I've come to get Luke.

      George nods. After another silence, John starts down the
      hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him.

 GEORGE                  John?    Are you alright?

      John turns around, surprised.

 JOHN                  I'm fine.

      The two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the
      room.

      His father steps into the living room and notices his jacket
      falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and
      sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane
      tickets and passports.

218 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 218 
      John steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke
      sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his
      face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here,
      and is overwhelmed.

219 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 219 
      George slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket.
      We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the
      passport and reads each of the false names.
 78. 


220 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 220 
      John brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like
      this. He tries to wake Luke.

 JOHN                  Hey.   Hey, buddy.

      Not a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just
      after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment.

221 INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT 221 
      John WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock.
      It's almost five. How could that have happened?

222 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT 222 
      John helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in
      his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food.

 JOHN                  What do you say?

 LUKE                  Thank you.

 JOHN                  Give Grandma a big kiss.

 LUKE                  I'm too tired to kiss.

 JOHN                  Luke...

 GRACE                  I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.
                     (to John)
                 We want to take him to the Harvest
                 Festival in Kutztown, where they
                 have the Clydesdales.

      John thinks about saying something, can't.   He watches Luke
      give Grace a kiss.

 LUKE                  Thank you, Grandma.

      John turns to his father, who stands in the doorway.

      His father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it.
      The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket.

 (CONTINUED) 79. 
222 CONTINUED: 222 
      John realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He
      looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John
      can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows.

 JOHN                    Bye Mom.

      They kiss.    John's father stands behind him.

 GEORGE                    Goodbye.

      George grabs his son in an awkward hug.      John is shocked.
      He pats his father's back. They break.

 JOHN                        (to Luke)
                   Let's go.

      John leaves.      The front door closes.   Grace walks away.

223 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- PRE-DAWN 223 
      John stands in the brightly lit, glass-walled kiosk of a
      rental car company, the Prius parked at the curb, as the sun
      threatens to break over the horizon.

224 EXT. STREET NEAR ALEX'S HOUSE -- PRE-DAWN 224 
      Nabulsi kneels beside a fire hydrant, using a shard from a
      taillight to scrape at a smudge of flaking black paint.
      Harris comes running up, out of breath, from the alley.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase
                   a black car down the alley, so that's
                   probably his. We'll have the
                   taillight debris at the lab by the
                   time it opens.

 LT. NABULSI                    Before.                                                         

      Nabulsi stands and hands him the large shard of glass.                       

225 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 225 
      John packs a backpack -- two white lab coats, wire cutters,
      a large screwdriver, two rolls of duct tape, the handgun,
      insulin vials, etc.
 80. 


226 INT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING 226 
      Luke sits on his bedroom floor, trying to cram a firetruck                
      into his already full rollerboard.                                        

 LUKE                      (calls)
                 Can I carry it?

      John appears with a box of trash bags.

 JOHN                  No.    Just what fits in your bag.                             

      John hurries off.

 LUKE                  ....What about my pockets?

 JOHN (O.S.)                  Or your pockets.

      Luke gives up on the truck and moves to his bedside table.
      He digs his hand into the small jar of coins his dad gave
      him and starts stuffing them in his pants pocket.

      A quarter falls and rolls to the middle of the floor.

227 INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- MORNING 227 
      John takes a thick felt marker and writes two numbers on his              
      wrist, right beside the watch. 15, and under it, 35.                      

      He then turns and stares at his wall, all the photos,
      sketches, notes, wondering if he's forgotten anything. He
      decides it is too late to worry. He loosens an edge of
      wallpaper and starts tearing it all down.

228 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - GARAGE AND ALLEY -- MORNING 228 
      Luke sits in the back seat with their carry-on bags. John
      tries to stuff all the garbage bags full of paper into the
      back.

      He picks the last off the floor and turns and walks out to
      the alley. He looks around, then stuffs this final bag into
      his neighbor's trash can.

229 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- MORNING 229 
      John tosses the last trash bags over the side of the dumpster             
      that sits in front of a demolished house. As he closes the
      tailgate we get a good look at the broken taillight.                      
 81. 


230 INT. PRIUS - DRIVING 230 
      He checks the clock on the dashboard and drives faster, taking
      a quick glance at his son to see if he is okay back there.

231 EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- MORNING 231 
      John sits in his car in the back alley, watching the parking
      lot. The driver comes out carrying trays of test results
      and puts them in the back of his van. John grabs the large                
      wire cutters and screwdriver from his car and hops out. He                
      takes a few steps to the rear of the one-story building,
      pries open the phone box and snips the phone wires.

232 INT. P.M.H. LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT 232 
      A clerk on the phone is cut off. She jabs the connection
      key, does not get a dial tone -- looks to the lights on the
      other phone lines and sees them go out as...

233 EXT. REAR OF P.M.H LAB -- AT THAT MOMENT 233 
      John snips the last wire and hops back into the car.     He is
      moving before the van exits the parking lot.

234 EXT. NURSING HOME -- MORNING 234 
      The van driver hops out and heads into the nursing home as
      the Prius pulls into the foreground. John turns to Luke.

 JOHN                  Daddy will just be a minute.

      John grabs his tennis ball.

235 INT. LABORATORY VAN -- MORNING 235 
      John holds his lab results between his teeth as he flips
      through the envelopes. He finally finds Lara's envelope,
      removes her report and replaces it with this one.

236 EXT. NURSING HOME -- MORNING 236 
      We watch through the windshield of the Prius as the lab van
      drives off in the direction of the prison.

      John tugs Carrie's birthday invitation from his pocket, flips
      it open, checks the handwritten address.

237 INT. POLICE STATION - HOMICIDE DIVISION -- MORNING 237 
      Harris enters Lt. Nabulsi's cubicle to find him standing.


 (CONTINUED) 82. 
237 CONTINUED: 237 
 SGT. HARRIS                    Taillight matches any 2004-2009 Prius.

 LT. NABULSI                        (with a certain disgust)
                   What kind of a criminal drives a
                   Prius?

 SGT. HARRIS                    A socially responsible one?
                       (avoids Nabulsi's searing
                        look by reading the report)
                   Over a thousand of them registered
                   in the city, seven thousand in the
                   state.

 LT. NABULSI                    How many registered to felons?

 SGT. HARRIS                    Six in the state. Four of them to
                   embezzlers or white collar criminals,
                   one to a rapist, one to a murderer.

 LT. NABULSI                    Guess we start with the murderer.

 SGT. HARRIS                    She's in prison for life.      The rapist
                   is out.

 LT. NABULSI                    Find him.

238 EXT. NICOLE'S HOUSE -- MORNING 238 
      John stands with Luke, who holds a hand-wrapped gift.        Luke            
      knocks at the front door of a lovely small house.                            

 NICOLE (O.S.)                    Hello?                                                          

      They see Nicole in the side yard, spreading a paper tablecloth.              

 JOHN                    ...Hi.                                                          

      They move to help keep the tablecloth from blowing away.                     

 NICOLE                    Thanks.   Good to see you.

                   It's a pony.                                               

 NICOLE                    Those aren't easy to wrap.                                 
                       (now awkward)
                   You know the party is at eleven,
                   right?

 JOHN                    What time is it?
                       (checks watch)
                   Nine. Oh, I'm so sorry, I should
                   have looked more carefully.

 NICOLE                    It's no problem.

                   Why don't you go give this to Carrie?                      

      Luke spots Carrie on the back step and runs over.                       

 NICOLE (CONT'D)                    Well, I guess you can help.                                

 JOHN                    Oh. Actually, I can't stay.   I have                       
                   to run some errands.

 NICOLE                        (recovering with grace)                                
                   We'll see you later then.                                  

 JOHN                    Thanks so much.
                       (a moment)
                   If....

      John looks to Luke and realizes this might be the last time             
      he sees him.                                                            

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    He...He has my parents' phone number
                   in his pocket. In case I'm late.

 NICOLE                    No problem.                                                

      John throws one more look at Luke then walks off.

 SGT. HARRIS                  No car in the garage. You want to
                 get a warrant?

 LT. NABULSI                  Yeah.

      Harris looks around to check no one is watching.

      follow procedure in taking the prisoner into the hospital.
      The sheriff watches until they are safe inside, then leaves.

254 INT. LUKE'S ROOM -- DAY 254 
      Nabulsi inspects Luke's room, still fully furnished, the
      curious faded crayon drawing on the wall. He spots a couple
      of coins on the floor. He picks up a quarter, and flips it.
      Harris steps into the room.

 SGT. HARRIS                  She's being transferred to University

 JAIL GUARD #1                    We have Lara Brennan.

      The duty nurse checks her chart and nods to a NURSE.                      

 DUTY NURSE                    Put her in 7725 and start an IV.                             

      The EMT passes her over to the nurse and leaves. The DUTY                 
      NURSE picks up the phone as they move off down the hall.

 JAIL GUARD #1                    Yeah?... We're here: prisoner's
                   secure, no problems.... Will do.

      He hangs up and turns to see John enter, carrying Luke's                  
      backpack, wearing a white doctor's smock. He raises a gun.                

 JOHN                    Put the phone down.

      Guard #1 obeys.

 JOHN DO IT!! 
      Guard #2 reaches for his weapon; John pistol whips him to                      
      the floor. The nurse cups a hand over her mouth to stifle a                    
      scream.

257 EXT. STREET -- DAY 257 
      Harris speeds toward the hospital.         Nabulsi is on the radio.

 DISPATCHER (V.O.)                    Lieutenant, the prisoner is secure;

                   squad car will meet you at the
                   entrance.

      Nabulsi puts the walkie down and flips on the siren.          Harris           
      reacts.

 SGT. HARRIS                    She just said --

 LT. NABULSI                    Run the light.

258 INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - ROOM 7725 -- DAY 258 
      A second handgun and holster      slides across the floor to meet              
      the one that already lies by      John's feet. The two guards
      kneel, facing the far wall.       John pulls a roll of duct tape               
      from the backpack and tosses      it to the terrified nurse.                   

 JOHN                    Tape their hands and feet.
                       (when he hesitates)
                   Do it!!

      The nurse tapes the guards' wrists behind their backs.                         

 LARA                    You have to stop this.

 JAIL GUARD #1                    You walk out that door with him and
                   you will both be killed.

 LARA                    No.   Stop.

      John yanks her clothing and a white smock out of the bag and
      tosses them to her.

 JOHN                    Put it on.

 LARA WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?! 
 JOHN                    Because we have no other choice!!

 LARA                    No.

 LARA                    No!

      They stare at each other.         John offers her his cell phone.

 JOHN                    Okay. Tell your son you aren't

       Lara stares at him with hatred, mutters:

 LARA                     You son of a bitch.

       Lara pulls off her prison garb, standing before them naked
       except for her panties. She quite purposely does not turn
       away or cover herself, but lets her eyes burn into him.
       John presses the STOPWATCH button on his watch and the COUNTER
       starts running.

       Lara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to               
       the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice            
       DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The              
       Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to              
       understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall                 
       and stares after them.                                                   

 DR. LIFSON                     What are you doing?                                         

       John yanks Lara's arm and makes a dash for the elevator,                 
       pulling his gun from his pocket.                                         

       The Duty Nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the

 LT. NABULSI                     What's wrong?

       Before he can answer, the elevator doors open and they come
       face to face with John and Lara. John sees their police IDs
       and levels his weapon.

       Around them, patients and employees scream and run away.

 JOHN                     Back away!

 LT. NABULSI                     Don't be stupid. Drop the weapon.                           

 JOHN                     Get back!

 LT. NABULSI                    We have units at every exit.     You'll

 JOHN                        (to Lara)
                   Hit the button.

      Lara stands frozen.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Hit it!

      She presses a button.     The doors start to close.

 LT. NABULSI                    Don't do this.                                               

      Doors closed.     Nabulsi runs and screams:

 LT. NABULSI (CONT'D)                    Where are the stairs?!

      HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2 leads the way. Nabulsi and Harris
      pass him at the door as he yells into his walkie.

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2                    Male and female; white lab coats!
                   Parking levels!

266 INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS 266 
 LARA                        (freaking out)
                   Oh please oh please oh please...

 JOHN                    It'll be okay.
                       (she keeps panicking)
                   Look at me! Do what I say; it'll be
                   okay; I promise.

      She stares at him, having never seen him like this before.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Lara?

      She nods.

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    Take the coat off.
 93. 


267 INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL AND P1 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 267 
      Nabulsi, Harris and the guard bound down the stairs into the
      lower elevator lobby. Nabulsi sees the doors aren't opening
      and runs back to the stairs, meeting the cop from upstairs
      on his way down.

 LT. NABULSI                   Stay here!

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #2                       (into walkie)
                  Parking garage! Get your asses down
                  here!

      Nabulsi and Harris leave them and thunder down the stairs.

268 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 268 
      The elevator doors open and John tosses the lab coats out
      toward a trash can in the direction of the garage. He pounds
      the elevator button.

269 INT. P2 LEVEL 269 
      Nabulsi and Harris burst onto this floor -- see the elevator
      doors are closed.

 LT. NABULSI                   Watch that door!

      Harris obeys as Nabulsi flings himself down the next flight.

270 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY - P3 LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 270 
      The elevator isn't closing. John slams the button repeatedly.
      He hears Nabulsi's heavy feet on the stairs, angles and aims
      the weapon -- Lara can't believe what she's witnessing.
      Suddenly the doors close, just a heartbeat before Nabulsi
      gets there. Nabulsi spots the discarded lab coats and runs
      out into THE GARAGE. He heads for the ramp, scanning the
      parked cars.

      Getting to the bottom of the ramp he looks up and sees a
      SQUAD CAR racing down toward him. As it brakes, Nabulsi
      realizes they couldn't have escaped this way; he's been had.              

 LT. NABULSI                       (shouts into walkie)
                  Who's in the lobby?!

      But he only gets static.    He charges back toward the stairs.            
 94. 


271 INT. ELEVATOR - LOBBY LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS 271 
      The doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his
      weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors
      he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's
      hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner.

      They weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing
      another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them.

      They turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward
      them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when
      Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs
      past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken
      their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and
      turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and
      speaks.

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1                  Main floor, rear corridor.

      John and Lara turn a corner. John spots the SHIPPING OFFICE.             
      They enter and head for the loading bay.

272 INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS 272 
      Nabulsi and Harris break into the lobby, sweating. Officers
      run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene,
      realizes they couldn't have gone out the front. He hears a
      shout:

 HOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)                  Back here!

      They turn and run in the direction of the voice, turning the
      corner and seeing the SECURITY GUARD at the end of the hall,
      who sees them coming turns and runs off after John and Lara.

 LT. NABULSI                      (into radio, on the run)
                 Get units to Grant Street!

273 EXT. HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS 273 
      John punches open the door and they hop down off the dock
      and take off for the street.

274 EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 274 
      John tugs Lara across the street, dodging traffic. He yanks              
      off his jacket and pulls it back on inside-out -- this side              
      is black and gold.                                                       
 95. 


275 EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 275 
       Nabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of                  
       Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very                     
       few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a                    
       crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to                 
       a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving                      
       toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team                      
       colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses.                            

276 EXT. NEARBY PEDESTRIAN MALL -- DAY 276 
       Lara and John weave through the fans.                                        

 JOHN                    Put your hair down.                                              

       Lara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then
       opens a door. Leaving the throng of fans, he guides Lara                     
       through and down the stairs into the T-Train Subway Station.

277 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS 277 
       Nabulsi runs to the crosswalk as Harris takes the other                      
       direction. The other two officers take the far sidewalks.                    

278 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 278 
       John and Lara quicken their pace.    The camera tilts up and                 
       to the glass ceiling.                                                        

278A EXT. PEDESTRIAN MALL -- CONTINUOUS 278A 
       Nabulsi searches the faces in the mall. He looks down through                
       the station skylight, catches a fleeting glimpse of them. He                 
       runs for the entrance, his walkie flying to his face.                        

 LT. NABULSI                    They're on the platform! Block

                   the Port Authority. Stop all trains!                             

279 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 279 
       John sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs.                  
       Almost dragging Lara, John nudges past slower people to make                 
       it onto the train. Then they wait. The doors don't close.                    

280 EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS 280 
       Walkie in hand, Harris jumps into their unmarked car and                     
       pulls out. Two SQUAD CARS wail out past him.

281 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 281 
      Above -- Nabulsi sees the train and shoves past commuters.                

282 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 282 
      John spots him coming, slips the long screwdriver from the                
      small backpack he's carrying. Lara sees him tighten his                   
      fingers around the grip. The doors finally close just as:                 

283 INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS 283 
      Nabulsi bounds down the stairs. The train leaves the station.             
      Nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it.                         

284 EXT. T-TRAIN STATION -- DAY 284 
      This station sits above ground. Three squad cars scream up.
      The officers clamor out of the cars and run for the platform.             

285 EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- DAY 285 
      Harris skids the unmarked vehicle around the corner, heading
      parallel to the underground.

286 INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL -- DAY 286 
      Nabulsi runs down the tracks, the car ahead nowhere in sight.

287 INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS 287 
      The T-Train DRIVER gets an emergency call from the base. He
      looks back into the car as IT RISES UP OUT OF THE UNDERGROUND.

      Daylight floods the car as the train emerges from underground.
      John jams the long screwdriver into the door and PRIES IT
 OPEN. 
288 EXT. T-TRAIN AND TRACKS -- DAY 288 
      The wheels SCREECH and the brakes SEIZE. Passengers topple
      to the floor. John grabs Lara and they leap out onto the
      tracks.

      He finds the slit he cut in the tall fence. They slip out
      through it, onto the street and into the parking lot beyond.

289 INT. HARRIS' UNMARKED CAR -- CONTINUOUS 289 
      Harris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks.
      He locks up his BRAKES as he sees the stalled T-Train.

290 EXT. PARKING LOT - OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS 290 
      John yanks off his jacket as they jump into the rented SUV.                 
      John calms his racing heart, drives away and turns the corner.              

291 EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- CONTINUOUS 291 
      Harris leaps from his vehicle and runs to the fence on his
      side of the tracks -- it is ten feet tall with razor wire,
      no way over it. He sees:

      Nabulsi charge up out of the tunnel. He jumps into the
      stalled train car, looks around, doesn't see John and Lara.

292 EXT. TUNNEL UNDER RIVER -- MORNING 292 
      The SUV comes up out of the dark and drives away from the
      city center, as a police helicopter swoops overhead, going
      the opposite direction.

293 INT. RENTED SUV -- MORNING 293 
      John checks the counter, still running on his watch. 11:05.
      He wets his thumb and rubs his wrist until the 15 is erased.
      All that remains now is the second number: 35. They merge
      into traffic heading toward the suburbs.

294 EXT. T-TRAIN TRACKS -- MORNING 294 
      Nabulsi pushes through the hole in the wire. Harris runs
      across the tracks with his jacket off, having scaled the
      fence on the far side.

 JOHN                    You would've stopped me.

      He nods toward the glove box                                                 

 JOHN (CONT'D)                    There's a case in there. Brush,

                   had was old. I hope I got it right.

      She opens the glove box, unzips the case, and is touched by                  
      this small gesture.

296 INT. POLICE STATION - HOMICIDE DIVISION -- DAY 296 
      Detective Collero, who we last saw when they arrested Lara,
      stops by Detective Quinn's cubicle.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    You want to take a guess who just
                   escaped from jail?

297 EXT. NICOLE'S HOUSE -- MORNING 297 
      Lara sits in the SUV at the curb. John waits at the door.
      It is opened by BRENDA, Nicole's mother.                                     

 BRENDA                    Hello.

 JOHN                    Hi.   I'm here for my son.

 BRENDA                    Oh, they aren't back yet.                                       

 JOHN                    Back from where?

 BRENDA                    The zoo.

 JOHN                    ...The zoo?                                                     

      Finds an invite and hands it to him.       The back clearly says             
      they are going to the zoo.                                                   

 BRENDA                    It's a zoo party.

 JOHH                    No.    Thank you.                                                   

      John turns and walks back to the SUV.          Brenda watches for a              
      moment, made curious by his behavior.

      He gets into the vehicle.         Lara is in a panic.

 LARA                    What's wrong?

      John punches ZOO into POINTS OF INTEREST on the GPS.                             

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Where's Luke?

 JOHN                    He's at the party.

      He sneaks a look at his stopwatch: 24 MINUTES and counting.

 LARA                    What party?     You said the party was                              
                   here.

 JOHN                    I was wrong.     She took them to the                               
                   zoo.

      The GPS comes up with an address.          John punches a button.

 LARA                           (can't help herself)
                   She?

      He drops the transmission into gear and speeds off.

298 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- MORNING 298 
      A squad car is waiting, another arrives.          Harris pulls up

299 EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING 299 
      John drives like a man possessed.

300 INT. SUV - DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION -- MORNING 300 
      John brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an                    
      intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror,                 
      the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them.

      John's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer              
      at 35, praying he's not their target.

      The police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the
      four lane street.

      John breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch -
      29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS.

 GPS VOICE                    Time to destination: eleven minutes.

      Lara sees him sweat, unaware of the significance of the time.

301 EXT. STREETS -- DAY 301 
      The SUV swerves around a corner, heading into the outskirts
      of town.

302 INT. SUV - FOUR LANE STREET -- DAY 302 
      John's eyes flick to his stopwatch: 32 minutes flicks to 33.

      Signs appear quickly now.    Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next
      Left.

      John keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to
      make this choice -- their freedom, or their son.

      Too many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can
      escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to
      them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his
      grandparents after all.

      Then there it is:

      The sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on
      the right.

      The sign to the Zoo sits behind it, pointing to the next road
      on the left.

 34:02, 34:03, 34:04... 
      John takes the freeway ramp.

303 EXT. INTERSTATE -- CONTINUOUS 303 
      The SUV climbs up the on-ramp, leaving the city behind.                  

304 INT. SUV - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS 304 
 LARA                    You took the wrong turn!    It's back
                   there.

      No response. Lara looks back over her shoulder, wondering                
      if this is some kind of shortcut.                                        

 LARA (CONT'D)                    The zoo is back there. You're going                         
                   the wrong way!                                              
                       (no response)                                           
                   It's back there!
                       (no response)
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!! 
 JOHN                    She'll call my parents.

 LARA                    What??

 JOHN                    They'll take care of him, I will
                   figure out how to get him to us.

 LARA                    Are you out of your mind!

 JOHN                    I tried!! There's no more time!!
                   Any second now there's going to be a
                   roadblock ahead! It might be there
                   now!! If we don't get out now we
                   don't get out!!

      Lara sits back in her seat, stunned and horrified, as John
      continues.




 (CONTINUED) 102. 
304 CONTINUED: 304 
 JOHN (CONT'D)                    I promise. I promise I will find a                           
                   way to get Luke to us. I will find
                   some way.

      Lara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch.
      John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he
      slams his foot on the brakes!

      The tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn.

      Horns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision.
      John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a
      circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder,
      miraculously facing in the right direction.

      John allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt.               
      She opens the door and steps out.                                         

      John closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back
      together. He opens his door and steps out.                                

305 EXT. INTERSTATE HWY - SHOULDER -- DAY 305 
      John sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's              
      pulled over. John nods to him that everything is okay and                 
      comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel
      shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the
      field beyond. He sits beside her in silence.

      Behind them the cars whip by.    No one even thinks to stop to
      see if they need help.

      Lara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field.

      There is nothing for either of them to say, they both know
      how they got here.

      Their hands sit on the gravel between each other. Without
      looking at him, Lara tentatively entwines a single finger
      with his. He slowly gathers strength from her touch.                      

306 INT. SUV - ON THE SHOULDER -- MOMENTS LATER 306 
      They close the doors, and John starts the engine and they
      drive forward. John takes the first exit.

307 EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE - ALLEY -- DAY 307 
      A garbage truck is just pulling up as Paula shows Harris and
      an officer her recycling bin. They pull out John's
      overstuffed trash bag.

308 EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE -- DAY 308 
      Lara sits in the SUV by herself, watching the entrance.

309 EXT. ZOO -- DAY 309 
      Nicole, surrounded by a dozen six year-olds, passes Luke off
      to John.

 JOHN                  No, it really is fine. I can't thank
                 you enough for taking care of him.

 NICOLE                  It is our pleasure.    Wasn't it,
                 Carrie?

      John and Luke turn and walk toward the exit.

310 EXT. ZOO ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS 310 
      Lara turns and sees John and Luke walking toward her.

 LARA                  Hi.

 LUKE                  Hi.

 LARA                  Did you have a nice time at the party?

 LUKE                  Yeah.

      Lara walks him to the car, as if this day is no different
      than any other.

 LARA                  What was your favorite thing?

 LUKE                  Ice cream cake.

      She lifts him into his seat and buckles him in.

 LARA                  They had ice cream cake here?

 LUKE                  At Carrie's house.



 (CONTINUED) 104.

 LARA                    Oh.   What flavor?

 LUKE                    Lots of flavors.

 LARA                    My favorite.

      John starts the car.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    I'm going to sit back here, okay?

 JOHN                    Sure.

      Luke plays with a toy. Lara closes the door behind her.
      She looks out the window and sees:

      NICOLE standing at the entrance, looking at her.                        

      Not exactly sure why she does it, LARA offers her a grateful
      smile.

      NICOLE watches them pull away, confused about what she should
      do.

311 INT. SUV - ZOO PARKING LOT EXIT -- CONTINUOUS 311 
      John drifts up to the stop sign at the intersection. A sign
      points out the interstate to the left -- and he can see the             
      overpass and freeway entrance; the business district to the             
      right. He checks his watch: 48 minutes. He resets it to                 
      zero. Game over.                                                        

      He switches on the radio and searches for NEWS.

      Luke taps Lara on the shoulder.    She leans down.

 LUKE                    I think we're going to the cottage.

 LARA                    Really?

      He nods knowingly.

 LUKE                    I have money.

      Lara almost loses it; smiles.


 (CONTINUED) 105. 
311 CONTINUED: 311 
 LARA                    Good.   Then I'll stick close to you.

 LUKE                    Okay.

      John finds the news station.

 NEWS RADIO                    -- Traffic down to two lanes at the
                   tollbooths. And downtown is worse.
                   Stay away from the train station if
                   you are trying to get anywhere. Not
                   sure what is happening but a KPGH                             
                   caller says trains aren't moving and
                   commuters are getting irate.
                       (etc.)

 LARA                    John?
                       (no reply)
                   What are we going to do?

 JOHN                        (finally)
                   We're going to the train station.

      John turns right, heading downtown.

312 INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY 312 
      Detective Quinn spots Harris fly in carrying a brimming green
      trash bag. Quinn jumps up and follows him into the SITUATION
      ROOM. COLLERO hurries to catch up.

      Harris dumps the contents onto the conference table as she
      enters. Quinn immediately dives into the contents. HARRIS
      and COLLERO share an awkward look.

 SGT. HARRIS                          (smitten)
                   Hi.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                          (casting her eyes down)
                   Hi.

      She and Harris dig into the crumpled papers and photos.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                         (to Collero)
                   You're not going to nod off, are
                   you?

      Collero gives Quinn a burning look.    Nabulsi enters.

313 EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DAY 313 
      John double-parks and pulls on a ball cap. Traffic is
      snarled, the place is awash with police and squad cars.
      Hundreds of people mill out front.

 JOHN                    Stay in the car.

      John puts on his sunglasses and walks right through the middle
      of it all. Lara watches, certain he will be spotted and
      arrested.

      John steps onto the crowded sidewalk outside the front doors.
      He speaks to a large woman; she shakes her head. He goes on
      to speak to a black couple, who apparently aren't interested.
      He approaches an elderly couple.

314 EXT. INTERSTATE -- DAY 314 
      The SUV heads up the on-ramp.

315 INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY 315 
      Nabulsi is on the phone, catching hell from his Captain, who            
      has had an earful from his counterpart in the State Police.             

 LT. NABULSI                    I understand....I understand. I
                   didn't tell them to stop EVERY
                   vehicle. Just the ones with a couple
                   and a young child.

      He hangs up, takes the quarter from his pocket and spins it
      on his desk.

316 INT./EXT. FREEWAY TOLLBOOTH -- DAY 316 
      John spies the tollbooth ahead, traffic down to two lanes.              
      The ELDERLY MAN beside him has a small bag on his lap.                  

 ELDERLY MAN                    Are you sure twenty dollars is enough?
                   Ticket to Buffalo costs three times
                   that.

      And now we notice the man's WIFE sitting in the back seat,
      with Luke and Lara. John pays the toll.

 JOHN                        (re: SUV)
                   This thing is very good on gas.

      A State Trooper waves them toward the booth.                                

      The trooper ahead checks them out and waves them on.       They             
      are free.

      The same trooper stops the car behind them -- in it, a couple               
      with a child.

317 INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- DAY 317 
 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    Every one in the state.

 LT. NABULSI                    Go wider. Send their photos to every
                   train, bus station and airport in a
                   three hundred mile radius.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                        (looking at her pad)
                   So, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia,
                   New York, New Jersey, Virginia,
                   Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana?

 LT. NABULSI                    You know what direction they are
                   going, smart ass?

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    Captain, a lot of these places barely
                   have fax machines.

 LT. NABULSI                    Then start dialing.
                       (as they exit:)                                            
                   Prioritize. Closest airports first.                            

      Nabulsi spins the quarter again, staring at it as if it will
      give him the answer.

318 EXT. DOWNTOWN BUFFALO -- AFTERNOON 318 
      The Brennans drop off the elderly couple. John waves, drops                 
      his gun in the trash can, gets back in and drives away.                     

319 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 319 
      Harris and Collero finish recreating a portion of John's

      Harris steps out into the HALL, passing an INTERVIEW ROOM.

      Behind the glass he sees QUINN grilling MICK. Harris keeps               
      going into Nabulsi's office. Nabulsi sits, spinning the
      coin, jacket off, shirt untucked.

 SGT. HARRIS                    You want to see it?

 LT. NABULSI                    Only if it will tell me where they
                   are.

 SGT. HARRIS                    Not so lucky.

      Nabulsi flattens the coin. Something makes him stare at his              
      fingers. He moves his hand, revealing a Canadian quarter.                

 LT. NABULSI                    How far is it to the Canadian border?

 SGT. HARRIS                    Four, five hours?

321 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- EVENING 321 
      Nabulsi comes out of his office, passing a waiting ERIT.

 ERIT                    Excuse me?   You call this coffee?

      Nabulsi shakes that off and enters the SITUATION ROOM. Every
      phone at the table is manned, all having the same conversation:

 SGT. HARRIS                    I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Police
                   Department. We have a fugitive
                   warrant for Lara and John Brennan,
                   they are most likely traveling with
                   their six year-old son, and we have
                   reason to believe they might be flying
                   out of your airport.

      Collero hangs up from her call and looks to the next number.

 LT. NABULSI                     How many airports in Ontario and

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     Should I stop calling and count?

       Nabulsi gives her a look.      Collero dials.

 SGT. HARRIS                     Yes, we are sending you photographs.
                    We would appreciate it if you could
                    disseminate them....How many terminals?

 DETECTIVE QUINN                         (bursts in)
                    I got his parents!

325 INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 325 
       John and Lara wait for Luke to step through the metal
       detector. The alarm sounds. John and Lara react as the
       security agent takes Luke into the glass isolation booth.

326 INT. POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOMS -- NIGHT 326 
       Collero questions Grace on the other side of the glass.       She

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    So, you just decided to go for a

 GRACE                    George wanted to see the leaves.

      Track to the next room, where Nabulsi questions George.

 LT. NABULSI                    So you have absolutely no idea where
                   they are going?

 GEORGE                    I told you.    We never spoke.

      George stares Nabulsi down.

327 INT. TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT -- NIGHT 327 
      A female security agent searches Luke, digs a handful of
      Canadian quarters out of his pocket. John's heart races.

328 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - PASSPORT CONTROL -- NIGHT 328 
      The Brennans approach passport control. Lara glances at
      John, sees he is sweating and red. She slips her hand into
      his and takes the passports.

 LARA                    I'll do this.

      She turns and smiles at the officer, putting on all her charm.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Hello.

      He remains stern-faced. Taking their passports, he examines
      them against PHOTOGRAPHS on his computer screen. He looks
      at them, looks at the passports again, then finally waves
      them through.

 LARA (CONT'D)                    Thank you.

      As they step away, the passport officer turns, sees his
      replacement waiting. He stands and exits to take his break.

      The SECOND PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER takes his seat and motions
      for the next traveler to approach. As they do an ALERT comes
      on his computer screen. He taps on it -- and up comes
      photographs of LARA and JOHN.

       He notes them, taps the screen again and the two take their
       place beside the others on the watch list. He motions for
       the traveler to hand over her passport.

329 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 329 
       The phones are quiet. Alone, Harris stares at the portion
       of the wall that he assembled. Collero enters.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Too bad you didn't find more of it.

 SGT. HARRIS                     Yeah. And wish I could figure out
                    where this is.

       He points to a small torn photo, taped back together.

 SGT. HARRIS (CONT'D)                     I checked websites for every tourist
                    destination I could --

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     That's the presidential palace.
                        (Harris turns & stares)
                    It was all over CNN. When they
                    deposed...what's-his-name.                                

330 INT. POLICE STATION - NABULSI'S OFFICE -- NIGHT 330 
       Harris bursts in.

 SGT. HARRIS                     We know where they're going!

331 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - GATE B-15 -- NIGHT 331 
       John and Lara sit, waiting to board, Luke asleep.                      

 AIR CANADA ATTENDANT (V.O.)                     We'll now begin boarding by rows.                         

331A INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - SECURITY OFFICE -- NIGHT 331A 
       An AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF snatches photos of Lara and John             
       out of the printer and bolts out of the office, joined by              
       two other OFFICERS.

332 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT 332 
       John, Lara and Luke walk down the jetway, until they are                   
       stopped by the crowd of passengers before them. John tries                 
       not to show how nervous he really is.                                      

332A INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - GATES -- NIGHT 332A 
       Airport Security runs up to the gate and pushes past the                   
       boarding passengers, searching their faces. The Airport                    
       Security Chief strides past the passengers and onto the                    
       jetway, the pages of photographs in his hand.                              

333 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 333 
       Nabulsi waits in silence on the other end of a phone.     The
       room is full, no one speaks.

334 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT 334 
       A second AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICER squeezes along the wall,                 
       passing the waiting passengers. We pan to see Luke's brightly              
       colored roller-board. Our hearts stop; it is all over.                     

335 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 335 
       Nabulsi waits on the other line for an eternity.    Finally:               

 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)                   Sorry. There is no one by their
                  description on the flight.

 LT. NABULSI                   They're on it. Do you have the                                  
                  photographs?                                                    

335A INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - JETWAY -- NIGHT 335A 
       The young AIR CANADA FLIGHT ATTENDANT kneels to help the                   
       child with the colorful rollerboard -- we see it's a FIVE                  
 YEAR-OLD GIRL. 
 AIR CANADA ATTENDANT                   Can I take this for you?                                        

 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (V.O.)                   We have the photographs. They aren't                            
                  on this plane.                                                  

336 INT. TORONTO AIRPORT - GATE 32 -- CONTINUOUS 336

 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF                        (listens, turns to attendant #2)                            
                   Are there any other flights to Haiti                            
                   tonight?

337 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 337 
 AIRPORT SECURITY CHIEF (O.S.)                    No other flights. Anything else?                                

 LT. NABULSI                    ....No.   Thank you.

      Nabulsi hangs up, defeated.     Quinn stares out the window,
      deep in thought.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    It's starting to rain.

      Nabulsi looks at him as if he's nuts.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                    I'll call the FBI.

      Collero exits, Quinn turns and looks at the partial "wall."

 DETECTIVE QUINN                    You ask yourself why we found this
                   bag and not the others?

338 INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT 338 
      Lara looks up from her son, sees her husband staring out the
      window at the darkness beyond. Ding.

 AIR CANADA ATTENDANT (V.O.)                    The captain has switched off the
                   seat belt light. Flight time to
                   Caracas, Venezuela this evening is
                   five hours and fifteen minutes.
                   While in your seat, the captain asks--                          

339 INT. POLICE STATION - SITUATION ROOM -- NIGHT 339 
      Now it's just Harris and Nabulsi, staring at John's wall.

 LT. NABULSI                    This guy was a teacher?

 SGT. HARRIS                    At a community college.

340 INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- DAWN 340 
       Sitting in his pajamas, George flips open an ancient atlas
       and runs his finger down across the Gulf of Mexico to Caracas,
       Venezuela. And he thinks of his grandson and smiles.

341 EXT. VENEZUELAN COUNTRYSIDE (HELICOPTER SHOT) -- DAY 341 
       A taxi snakes along a mountain road, through the dense forests
       of Venezuela.

342 INT. TAXI - DRIVING - MOUNTAIN ROAD -- DAY 342 
       Exhausted but awake, John stares out the window at the
       coastline below. Lara and Luke sleep beside him.

343 EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY 343 
       More rain. Detective Quinn squats in the covered parking lot,              
       staring at the spot where the crime took place. Flash to:                  

344 EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT 344 
       Elizabeth turns at her car, is slammed in the head with the
       extinguisher and she falls dead.

       The extinguisher is tossed to the floor and rolls.

       A YOUNG FEMALE JUNKIE yanks at Elizabeth's purse, getting                  
       blood on her hands before she frees it. She looks like a                   
       junkie. She runs off toward the sidewalk.                                  

344A QUINN - IN THE PRESENT 344A 
       Turns and sees...                                                          

344B LARA - IN THE PAST 344B 
       She hurries along the sidewalk to get out of the rain.                     
       Turning the corner into the garage she COLLIDES with the                   
       JUNKIE. Lara's purse catches the woman's coat.                             

       The JUNKIE puts her hand on Lara's shoulder, leaving a SMUDGE              
       OF ELIZABETH'S BLOOD on Lara's raincoat. She tugs free. A                  
       BUTTON from the woman's coat POPS OFF and hits the sidewalk.

       Lara turns and yells "Hey," then keeps going.

       She is about to get in the car when she sees the fire
       extinguisher in front of her left wheel. She picks it up,
       turns, annoyed. She places it down by the wall.



 (CONTINUED) 115. 
344B CONTINUED: 344B 
       Lara gets in her car and drives off, oblivious to Elizabeth's           
       body lying on the concrete floor on the passenger's side.

       Her co-worker sees her drive off as he steps into the garage.           
       He spots the body and turns and looks after Lara's car.                 

345 EXT. LARA'S OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- DAY 345 
       Quinn puts his used gum in a wrapper. COLLERO watches from              
       the car as her partner walks to the corner of the building.             
       QUINN steps up to where the two women collided and looks                
       down at the sidewalk.                                                   

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Was it raining when we searched the                        
                    crime scene?

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     Three years ago?? What are we doing
                    here?

       Quinn drops his gum wrapper onto the sidewalk. It hits a                
       stream of water coming out from a rain gutter and washes                
       away. Quinn watches it -- then follows... Collero shakes                
       her head, grabs a newspaper to keep the rain off and follows.

       The gum wrapper washes over the curb into the gutter and                
       travels to the storm drain a half a block away.

       Quinn gets there, kneels.

 DETECTIVE QUINN                     Act like a cop. Grab the other side.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO                     You're out of your mind.

       Quinn jerks the grate up.    Collero grabs the other side and
       helps him lift.

       They stare down into the hole. Quinn runs his hand along
       the lip, digging up the mud and sediment...finds nothing.

 DETECTIVE COLLERO (CONT'D)                     You really thought you were going to
                    find it?

       Collero wipes her hands on a tissue as Quinn stares down the
       hole a little longer, then lets the grate fall.




 (CONTINUED) 116. 
345 CONTINUED: 345 
 CLOSE ON INSIDE LIP OF STORM DRAIN 
      Just before the grate clangs we see JUNKIE'S JACKET BUTTON,              
      squeezed between the grate and the wall.                                 

346 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - SOUTH AMERICA -- EVENING 346 
      The taxi crosses the ancient square of a small town.

347 INT. COLONIAL HOTEL -- EVENING 347 
      The room has two single beds. John waits at the bathroom
      door. Lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them.

      She touches his hand. He offers a smile. She slips past
      him. He steps into the bathroom and closes the door. Lara
      lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face
      to face with her sleeping son.

      Without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first
      time, without being prodded. He turns around and lets her
      wrap her arms around him. And she almost dies of happiness.

348 INT. HOTEL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 348 
      John washes, trying not to look in the mirror, not wanting
      to glimpse the man he has become.

349 INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT 349 
      Lara and Luke sleep, spooning. John sits on the other bed.
      He picks up the TV remote and flips through Spanish language
      stations. And there it is: CNN in English. Sports right
      now, but John knows there is no place they can hide.

350 INT. BAR -- DAY 350 
      Damon takes the money from John's wallet, leaves him with a
      twenty.

 DAMON                    Good luck.

      Damon leaves him there. As John wonders if he is capable of
      doing this, we cut to BLACK. Read:

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM

               Union Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art 
               Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still 
               grand.

               A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main 
               concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00.

               Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter.

               THE TIME -

               12:06.

               We see the big hand slam into "7".

               A loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from 
                         San Diego, Del Mar...

               EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM

               The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow, 
               grinding stop.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, 
                         and Irvine is now arriving at Gate 
                         Nine.

               Doors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Amtrack 264 will be departing in 
                         fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for 
                         Oxnard, Ventura...

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM

               A MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors. 
               He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his 
               beefy counterpart.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc...


               THE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo...

               Then he looks up to the big clock.

               12:07.

               The minute hand slams into the "8".

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...and points north.

               He resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of 
               the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look sharp.

               They stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the 
               crowd.

                                     MS. JONES
                         That one.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Nah.  Hates his wife.

               They're talking about a couple in their forties.  She 
               motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband 
               follows with the suitcases.

               WHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by.

                                     MS. JONES
                         I hate rollerblades.

               EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM

               The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding 
               a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the 
               steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within 
               the train:

                                     GENE
                         Lynn!  Lynn!!


               GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and 
               inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. 
               He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her.

                                     GENE
                         Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?

               As he comes down the steps:

                                     GENE
                         I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of 
                         my sight, all right? I want you to 
                         stay right by me. Will you do that 
                         for me?

                                     LYNN
                         Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the 
                         platform and gives out an exaggerated 
                         sigh.

                                     GENE
                         We made it.

               LYNN nods back.

                                     LYNN
                         We made it.

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:08PM

               WHOOSH! A SECURITY GUARD approaches the two ROLLERBLADING 
               TEENS. They circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away, 
               laughing.

               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as 
               they come through the gate.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Skate-boarders I don't mind, even 
                         though they dress like fuckin' idiots, 
                         but when I see some pin-head on 
                         rollerblades, I get the definite 
                         urge to grease the grill of my car 
                         with 'em.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Keep your eyes peeled.

                                     MS. JONES
                         What about them?


                                     MR. SMITH
                         Too old.

               They're talking about a COUPLE IN THEIR SIXTIES, warmly 
               greeting each other.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Him!

                                     MR. SMITH
                         If you ever had an idea it would die 
                         of malnutrition. First those blue 
                         hairs then some Spic.  Leave this to 
                         me. I know people. It's my job. I'm 
                         a people person.

               MR. SMITH laughs at his joke.

                                     MS. JONES
                         What the fuck are you looking for?

               MR. SMITH has spotted someone.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I'm looking for them.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Where?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Right there.

               He starts walking towards the exit gate.

               INT. UNION STATION -ARRIVAL CONCOURSE - DAY - 12:09PM

               GENE has emerged with LYNN. They pause there, getting their 
               bearings. Next to them, a YOUNG COUPLE is kissing. They can't 
               keep their hands off each other.

                                     GENE
                         I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do 
                         you see a phone?

               LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them, 
               covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE 
               laughs.


                                     GENE
                         Come on, you.

               They start walking across the concourse, towards MR. SMITH 
               and MS. JONES.

                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss 
                         like that?

                                     LYNN
                         On TV.

                                     GENE
                         You never saw your Mom and me kiss 
                         like that?

               LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows 
               down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level. 
               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move 
               around them, and keep going.

                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You 
                         can talk about her all you want. You 
                         know that, don't you?

               LYNN nods.

                                     GENE
                         So, come on. You never saw us kiss 
                         like that?

                                     LYNN
                         No way.

                                     GENE
                         How did you see us kiss?

               LYNN gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss.

                                     GENE
                         That's it? That little peck of a 
                         kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some 
                         kisses.


               LYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to 
               him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at 
               the big clock.

               12:10.

                                     GENE
                         Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.

               INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PM

               MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target: 
               the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE.

               WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them. 
               MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls 
               her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on 
               the couple.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look at 'em. He'd do anything for 
                         her.-

                                     MS. JONES
                         Young love.

               The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words 
               themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are 
               only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR. 
               SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (sotto voce)
                         Foreigners! Fuck!

                                     MS. JONES
                         Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and 
                         when we need their help in Kuwait, 
                         where the fuck are they?

               MR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with.

               INT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PM

               GENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has 
               wandered a few yards away.


                                     GENE
                         Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have 
                         an interview with him at twelve-
                         thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is 
                         Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at 
                         the last minute like this but... 
                         Hey, hey!

               He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN, 
               one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.

                                     GENE
                         Watch that! Lynn, come here!

               She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a 
               victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES. 
               MR. SMITH has noticed GENE.

               GENE at the phone.

                                     GENE
                         Sorry. There's some crazy kids on 
                         skates. Listen, the train just got 
                         in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few 
                         minutes late.

               The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other 
               objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH 
               watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand-
               filled ashtray next to him.

                                     GENE
                         Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as 
                         I can. Bye, now.

               He hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS.

                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Ready?

                                     LYNN
                         Nods.

                                     GENE
                         Let' s do it.

               He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to 
               knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The 
               ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they 
               hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing 
               nasty things to knees and wrists.


                                     GENE
                         Whoops.

               He stands over them with LYNN.

                                     GENE
                         Now, see, this is why you should 
                         always wear a helmet and knee pads. 
                         You never know when you're going to 
                         fall down and go boom. Right?

                                     LYNN
                         Right.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PM

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Perfect.

               He starts forward.

                                     MS. JONES
                              (not so sure)
                         Perfect.

               She follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Could I see some identification, 
                         sir?

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     MS. JONES
                              (ditto with the badge)
                         I.D. Could we see some?

                                     GENE
                         Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? 
                         Will a driver's license do?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That'll do just fine.

               GENE pulls out his wallet, surprised and confused. MR. SMITH 
               looks at it.


                                     GENE
                         Is this about those kids? Look, I'm 
                         sorry about that. But they darn 
                         near...

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?

                                     GENE
                         Yes.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Where's that?

                                     GENE
                         Near Lompoc, north. What's...

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Come with us, sir.

                                     GENE
                         I'd like to know what...

                                     MR."SMITH
                         Don't cause a ruckus, sir.

               He pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not-
               so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You don't want to cause a ruckus, 
                         with the little girl and all.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Come with me, honey.

               MS. JONES swoops LYNN up and heads for the station entrance.

                                     GENE
                         Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take 
                         the girl!

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Don't worry. She's good with kids.

               GENE hurries after MS. JONES. MR. SMITH grabs up the 
               suitcases.


               INT. UNION STATION - SOUVENIR SHOP - DAY - 12:11PM

               MS. JONES nears a souvenir stand. The OWNER is looking the 
               other way. Without breaking stride, MS. JONES reaches out, 
               snatches a child's coloring book and crayons.

                                     LYNN
                         You stole that.

                                     MS. JONES
                         No, I didn't. I confiscated it. 
                         There's a difference.

               And they're out the door, GENE hurrying after. The big hand 
               on the big clock moves.

               12:12.

               EXT. UNION STATION PARKING LOT - DAY - 12:12PM

               MS. JONES heads for-a van with smoked windows. She gets inside 
               with LYNN. GENE stops a few feet away.

                                     GENE
                         What is going on?

               MR. SMITH prods him in the ribs.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.

               GENE looks desperately around for help. There is none. He 
               lets MR. SMITH push him toward the van.

               INT. VAN -.DAY - 12:13PM

               LYNN and MS. JONES are in the back.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Let's get your seatbelt on. Always 
                         gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that 
                         right?

               LYNN resists.

                                     LYNN
                         I want my daddy.


               GENE climbs into the front passenger seat.

                                     MS. JONES
                         There's your daddy. See? We're your 
                         daddy's friends.

               MR. SMITH climbs into the driver's seat.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's right. The policeman is your 
                         friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?

               GENE looks down. MR.. SMITH has pulled his gun. He points it 
               casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general 
               direction of the little girl.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Daddy?

                                     GENE
                         Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our 
                         friends.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey, would you look at this crazy 
                         car? Everybody has their own radio. 
                         What do you think of that?

                                     LYNN
                         Everybody does?

                                     MS. JONES
                         Yep. And you can listen to it without 
                         anybody else listening. Let's try it 
                         out.

               She puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in 
               end.

                                     MS. JONES
                         This is what they call the jack. Hi, 
                         Jack!

                                     LYNN
                         Laughs.

                                     MS. JONES
                         It goes in that little hole.


                                     LYNN
                         Let me do it.

               She plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN 
               gets a big smile on her face.

                                     LYNN
                              (loudly)
                         It's loud!

               She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, 
               etc., oblivious to all else.

                                     MS JONES
                         Removes a Pro Label Machine from 
                         under the seat. She begins to type 
                         in several characters.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Let's get down to business.

                                     GENE
                         Who are you? You're not the police.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Brilliant.

               MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic 
               emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag.  He looks 
               back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun. 
               It hurts.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay 
                         attention and your daughter won't be 
                         hurt.

                                     GENE
                         You wouldn't...

                                     MS. JONES
                         Try us.

               He looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair.

                                     GENE
                         Get your hands off her.

               He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         Mr. Watson, you're not paying 
                         attention. Your daughter's life 
                         depends on you. Do you understand 
                         that?

               GENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having 
               a hard time focussing.

               She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR. 
               SMITH Do you understand?

                                     GENE
                         Yes, yes, I understand.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Good.

               He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in 
               GENE'S lap.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         This is for you. In it there is a 
                         picture of a woman and an itinerary. 
                         It is her itinerary. She is presently - 
                         are you listening, Mr. Watson?

                                     GENE
                         Yes, I'm listening.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         She is presently at the Bonaventure 
                         Hotel. That's right near here.

               He gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is 
               glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         When you leave this van you will get 
                         yourself a cab and take it to the 
                         Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will 
                         take this.  

               MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the 
               back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it 
               in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         ...and you will kill the woman whose 
                         picture is in there. Not just shoot 
                         her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend 
                         you empty the gun into her. Close 
                         up. Got all that?

               It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain.

                                     GENE
                         You're out of your mind.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What's your point?

                                     GENE
                         I will do no such thing.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.

               A "snap!" from the back seat. GENE looks. MS. JONES has broken 
               a carrot stick. She breaks another.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Don't worry. We'll take good care of 
                         the kid.

               She gives half the carrot stick to LYNN, pops the other half 
               in her mouth and grinds it to pulp. MR. SMITH is checking 
               his watch.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         It is now 12:16. If the woman in the 
                         picture is alive at 1:30...
                              (holds up a walkie-
                              talkie)
                         ...I call my partner, your daughter 
                         is dead.

               He looks in the rear-view mirror to MS. JONES.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         And what happens if I don't call 
                         you?

                                     MS. JONES
                         I kill her anyway.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do 
                         you understand?

               He taps the manila envelope.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         The woman in the picture...

               He indicates the back seat with his head.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         ...or your daughter.

               GENE looks at his daughter.

                                     GENE
                         Oh, my God...

               MR. SMITH reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope 
               into GENE'S pockets.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only 
                         you can help her.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Only you.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You're wasting time.

               He reaches across GENE, opens the door and pushes him out, 
               then follows him. LYNN takes off the ear-phones, tries to 
               undo her seatbelt.

                                     LYNN
                         Where is my daddy going?

               MS. JONES wraps a big arm around her.

                                     MS. JONES
                         He's going to help the police. Your 
                         daddy is going to be a hero.

                                     LYNN
                         My daddy is going to be a hero? Like 
                         Power Rangers?


                                     MS. JONES
                         Just like Power Rangers.

               EXT. UNION STATION PARKING'LOT - DAY - 12:18PM

               MR. SMITH activates the walkie-talkie, speaks into it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Let's test this thing. You on?

               He holds it up for GENE to hear.

                                     MS. JONES (O.S.)
                              (filtered)
                         Reading you.

               MR. SMITH still has GENE'S wallet. He opens it, pulls out 
               some cash, puts it in GENE's breast pocket.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You'11 need some cash.
                              (re: the wallet)
                         I'll hang onto this for the time 
                         being. Oh, and...

               He grabs one of GENE's hands.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You'll need these.

               He dumps six bullet's into GENE's palm from a cloth Chivas 
               Regal bag.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a 
                         wastin'.

               GENE just stands there, transfixed by the bullets in his 
               hand. MR. SMITH reaches out, turns him around and gives him 
               a shove away from the van and into the midst of...

               EXT. UNION STATION - PARKING LOT - BUS STOP - DAY - 12:19PM

               ...a LARGE CROWD OF TOURISTS, that have just exited an 
               arriving mini-bus. GENE is caught up in the crowd and carried 
               along like a leaf in a stream.

               Amid the chattering CROWD, GENE is pushed along as if in a 
               trance. He touches the pocket with the gun. He looks at the


               Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's 
               like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets, 
               turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist 
               him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see...

               The van is gone!

               ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM

               He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks 
               desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his 
               surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. 
               He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step.

               A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S 
               legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds 
               himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart 
               plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her.

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         Mama!

               She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, 
               reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching 
               the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder.

               Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT 
               POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station.

               It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He 
               is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more 
               confident.

               Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into 
               view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right 
               past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in 
               behind him speaking in his ear.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You talk to a cop, you even look at 
                         a cop too long and your daughter is 
                         dead.
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Do it.

                         Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling 
                         Daddy. Come in, Daddy.

               GENE grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man.

                                     GENE
                         Lynn!

                         I can hear you good. Can you hear 
                         me?

                                     GENE
                         Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's enough.

                                     MS. JONES (V.O.)

                         He has to say "over and out". Daddy, 
                         you have to say "over and out".

                                     GENE
                         Over and out.

               MR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look at your watch. Look at it! At 
                         one-thirty your little girl is dead. 
                         Say it with me. At one-thirty my 
                         little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!

                                     GENE
                              (softly)
                         At one thirty my little girl is dead.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Unless you do what you're told. Go 
                         do it!


               He pushes GENE on, toward a cab.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         And don't forget I'll be watching 
                         you.

               GENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH 
               raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the 
               stand.

               EXT. UNION STATION - CAB STAND - DAY - 12:21PM

               The CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his 
               cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab.

                                     CABBIE
                         Where to, sir?

                                     GENE
                         The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure 
                         Hotel. Do you know where that is?

               The CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into 
               the cab.

               INT. CAB - DAY - 12:21PM

               The CABBIE gets in and they take off. GENE stares at the 
               manila envelope in his hand. He starts to open it, is stopped 
               by:

                                     CABBIE
                         Amtrack?

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     CABBIE
                         You just come in on Amtrack?

                                     GENE
                         Uh, yes..

                                     CABBIE
                         Business or pleasure?

                                     GENE
                         Business.


                                     CABBIE
                         Where'd you come from?

                                     GENE
                         San Diego.

                                     CABBIE
                         Oh, San Diego? I've thought about 
                         moving to San Diego.  It's hard to 
                         make a living in this town. These 
                         short hops.  Can't make a dime on 
                         'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can 
                         make a buck. These little hops cost 
                         me money.

                                     GENE
                         Sorry.

                                     CABBIE
                         'S okay. What do you think?

                                     GENE
                         Huh?

                                     CABBIE
                         Better in San Diego? More opportunity 
                         there? What?

                                     GENE
                         I really don't know. I don't live 
                         there. I was just visiting...a grave.

                                     CABBIE
                         Aw, too bad.

               They lapse into silence. GENE starts to open the envelope 
               again.

                                     CABBIE
                         Somebody close?

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     CABBIE
                         The grave. Somebody close?


                                     GENE
                         Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were 
                         separated. She was thinking about a 
                         divorce.

               GENE notices the dashboard clock -

               12:22

               GENE leans forward.

                                     GENE
                         Look...I've... I've got a problem. A 
                         big problem...

                                     CABBIE
                         Oh, yeah?

               He hits the horn and swerves to the left.

                                     CABBIE
                         Jesus! Watch it, buddy!

               EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY - 12:22PM

               GENE looks out his window and finds himself staring at MR. 
               SMITH, staring back at him, driving the van, next to him. He 
               throws himself back in the seat.

               INT. CAB - DAY - 12:22PM

               The cab pulls into the drive front of the Bonaventure Hotel 
               and stops.

                                     CABBIE
                         I'd love to hear about your problem, 
                         but the ride's over. Three-fifty.

               GENE looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to 
               the curb on the other side of the street.

                                     CABBIE
                         Three-fifty. I hope your problem 
                         doesn't have anything to do with my 
                         three-fifty.

               GENE looks back at the CABBIE, waiting for his fare.


                                     GENE
                         Right. Right.

               GENE digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his 
               business cards. He hurriedly writes on it: "HELP. VAN KIDNAP 
               CHILD." He wraps a five around it, pushes it into the CABBIE'S 
               hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.

               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM

               GENE stops a few yards from the cab, watching the CABBIE.

               INT. CAB - DAY - 12:23PM

               The CABBIE finds the secreted card, but looks at the wrong 
               side.

                                     CABBIE
                         What do I want with an accountant?

               A DOORMAN leans down at the window.

                                     DOORMAN
                         I got one for the airport. You free?

                                     CABBIE
                         You bet.

               The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away, 
               the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it 
               up.

               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM

               GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm 
               snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what 
               it is. He looks around.

               VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and 
               going. No one pays particular attention to him.

               GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out 
               and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away.

               GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately 
               hanging onto the last glimpse of it.


               MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE 
               goes into the hotel.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

               GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air-
               conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants, 
               waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance.

               HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

               Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around 
               this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by 
               someone high above.

               CLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM

               GENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He 
               breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he 
               starts tracking all around him, seeing...something.

                                     GENE
                         Oh, my God. Oh, no.

               He desperately fumbles in his pocket.

               Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a 
               huge, rolled up banner.

               GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He 
               rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, 
               the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous 
               reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the 
               same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of 
               it in your best red, white, and blue:

                         "RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR"

               And an addendum:

                                      "HERE TODAY!"

                                     GENE
                         Oh, shit.

               It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see 
               what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere. 


               On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several 
               years her junior. These have the caption, "Governor Grant 
               and husband Brendan".

                                     GENE
                         Oh, sweet Jesus...

               His eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance, 
               walkie-talkie in hand, watching him.

               GENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and 
               gives GENE a move of the head - "Get to it."

               GENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate 
               him, then slides out the itinerary.

               The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00 
               noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor 
               Samara Grant".

               GENE checks his watch.

               12:26.

               He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy, 
               GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays.

                                     GENE
                         Could you tell me where the Emerald 
                         Bay Room is?

               GUSTINO points up.

                                     GUSTINO
                         Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow 
                         the signs.

               GENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns 
               back.

                                     GENE
                         Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

               GUSTINO smiles.

                                     GUSTINO
                         No problem.


               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:26PM

               GENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third       
               floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs.

               INT. "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:2 6PM

               The whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as Gene 
               ascends.

               GENE forces himself not to look at MR. SMITH behind him. His 
               nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination.

               INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 12:26PM

               GENE sees the arrow and sign for the Emerald Bay Room.  He 
               walks that way. MR. SMITH follows.

               INT. THIRD FLOOR - SHOP ARCADE AREA - DAY - 12:27PM

               GENE and MR. SMITH pass gift shops, snack bars. The walkway 
               is crowded and GENE is going against the tide of REPORTERS, 
               POLITICIANS, SUPPORTERS, and just a lot of PEOPLE WITH NAME 
               TAGS.

               GENE plows on through...

               ...and runs smack into BRENDAN GRANT.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (laughs)
                         Whoops!

               The two men reel back from each other. A SECURITY MAN, 
               earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them. 
               BRENDAN GRANT is a charmingly smooth man.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Nice body check.

               He continues on, talking to an ATTRACTIVE WCMAN COMPANION.

               BRENDAN GRANT What the Governor really admires, Mrs. Wentzel, 
               and Eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion, 
               are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it 
               into a positive force.


               He slides a familiar hand around her waist.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         You know my wife has a deeply personal 
                         reason for going after repeat drunk 
                         drivers. They are felons and they 
                         should be treated as such. A drivers 
                         license is a privilege, not a right.

               And he is hustled away. Right past an election poster 
               featuring him and Governor Grant.

               Still stunned by the encounter, GENE turns back and watches 
               the Governor's husband, but keeps walking.

               INT. EMERALD BAY ROOM - DAY - 12:28PM

               It is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. GENE comes 
               in.

               A WOMAN is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's 
               just copped.

                                     GENE
                         Excuse me, is the...thing over?

                                     WOMAN
                         Yes. You didn't miss much. The 
                         food...chicken again.

                                     GENE
                         Eleanor Grant is gone?

                                     WOMAN
                         Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same 
                         at all these...

               But GENE has turned away. The WOMAN gives him a face, grabs 
               another centerpiece and exits. A CLEAN-UP CREW is starting 
               to go through the room. GENE leans against a wall, breathing 
               through a combination of relief and agony.

               MR. SMITH is suddenly next to him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Check your itinerary. Move along.


               GENE gets out the itinerary. "12:30 - 12:45 - Hors d'oeuvres/ 
               Buffet w/Friends of Eleanor Samara Grant - INVITATION ONLY -
               Bona Vista Lounge".

                                     GENE
                         This says "invitation only".

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Of course you're invited. You're a 
                         big donor to the campaign. They love 
                         you.

               MR SMITH digs  into the manila envelope, comes out with a 
               handful of security badges, name tags, invites. He plucks 
               the name tag that MS JONES printed earlier. It has a red 
               ribbon signifying a Major Donor to the Campaign. He fastens 
               it to Gene's lapel.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red 
                         Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.

                                     GENE
                         Where did you get these? Who are 
                         you?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I'm the guy who's going to kill your 
                         daughter if you don't get moving.

               INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE "RED" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:28PM

               GENE approaches. He notices a flurry of movement, a small 
               GROUP OF PEOPLE moving determinedly through the lobby. It is 
               GOVERNOR ELEANOR GRANT with a small entourage!  She is a 
               handsome woman in her fifties. The entourage consists of 
               KRISTA BROOKS, Eleanor's, late-twenties assistant, a few 
               assorted POLITICAL AIDES and a couple of PEOPLE WITH NAME 
               TAGS. GENE is not sure what to do. The group reaches the 
               elevator. KRISTA pushes the button.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         They-didn't hear a word I said. The 
                         mike was too low on the podium.

                                     KRISTA
                         How much did we pay for that room?


                                     CHIEF AIDE
                         We didn't.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Somebody did.

               KRISTA turns to an Aide.

                                     KRIST
                         A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.

               The elevator doors open. They crowd in. The doors start to 
               close.

               Gene looks around, where did Mr. Smith go?

               GENE springs forward, thrusts his hand between them. The 
               doors stop, then bounce open. GENE is startled, finding 
               himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard.

                                     BODYGUARD
                         Excuse me, sir, this car is for the 
                         Governor. You can take the next one.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Don't you dare, Franco. This is one 
                         of our biggest supporters.

               She smiles charmingly, offers her hand to GENE.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial 
                         incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- 
                         it? I love saying that.

               GENE steps aboard, shakes her hand.

               INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM

               The elevator begins to rise.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Whose idea was it to have a lunch 
                         right after the brunch? I'm about to 
                         bust as it is.
 

                                     KRISTA
                         We'll just walk through, do a little 
                         grip-and-grin, then get ready for 
                         the press con.

               INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR

               We are on the third floor.

               The doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise.

                                     GENE
                         Governor...

               It comes out a little louder then he intended. He has turned, 
               his back to the door. Everyone looks at him. He's committed.

                                     GENE
                         I need your help.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What can I do for you Mr....Watson?

                                     GENE
                         Its'...ah...about my daughter....

               The elevator slows and stops on the next floor above.

               INSERT FLOOR INDICATOR

               We are on the fourth floor.

               Behind GENE, the doors open.

                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)
                         Room for one more?

               GENE freezes.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I think we can accommodate you.

               She offers her hand to MR. SMITH as he steps on board.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial 
                         incumbent.
 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         A pleasure to meet you, Governor.

               The car begins to rise again. ELEANOR .GRANT turns back to 
               GENE.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You were saying?  Your daughter....?

                                     GENE
                         I...

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Yes?

               ANGLE ON MR SMITH

               Yes???

               ANGLE ON GENE

               What to do now?

                                     GENE
                         She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure 
                         to get your autograph.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Of course.  I wish everything were 
                         that easy.

                                     KRISTA
                         I've got the pen if you've got the 
                         paper.

               GENE looks at her. She smiles back.

                                     KRISTA
                         How about that?

               He looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, 
               the one MR. SMITH gave him.

                                     KRISTA
                         Is that something precious?

                                     GENE
                         No, that's,..that's fine
 

               He gives it to ELEANOR GRANT. KRISTA hands over the pen. 
               GENE's eyes flick over to MR. SMITH who is staring at the 
               envelope.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What's her name?

               GENE looks at the Governor, only inches away, back to MR. 
               SMITH, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt -
               do it! GENE pulls his eyes away.

                                     GENE
                         Her name? Her name is Lynn.

               ELEANOR GRANT writes the autograph. MR. SMITH'S eyes drill 
               into him. GENE looks over. MR. SMITH raises a hand to his 
               face, pretends to scratch an itch. His other hand taps his 
               wristwatch. GENE's hand slides toward his jacket pocket.  
               Sweat beads on his forehead. He's barely aware of KRISTA 
               talking to him.

                                     KRISTA
                         It's funny. I don't even keep a pad 
                         of paper with me anymore, everything's 
                         gone so electronic.

               He gives her a quick, weak smile. His free hand wipes the 
               sweat from his face.

                                     KRISTA
                         If it wasn't for double A batteries 
                         I'd be in big trouble.

               He is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops 
               when he notices MR. SMITH'S hand slide into his jacket, where 
               his gun is.

               He looks at the other MR. SMITH, earphone, crewcut-Security. 
               There is the hint of a gun on his hip.

               GENE's eyes widen, dart to MR. SMITH'S face, his hand sliding 
               into his coat. His hand hovers over his gun, trembling. Is 
               the SECURITY MAN staring at him?

               ELEANOR GRANT hands over the autograph.
 

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Are you all right? Elevators make me 
                         queasy, too.

               GENE gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. He takes 
               his hand out of his pocket. It's shaking. He clenches it to 
               stop the shakes.

               The doors open, startling him.

               INT. THIRTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:2 9PM

               ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage exit to greetings and 
               applause.

               GENE stays in the elevator, frozen, alone with MR. SMITH.

               The doors close and the elevator descends.

               INT. "RED ELEVATOR" - DAY - 12:29PM

               MR. SMITH is fuming, his face red. He explodes.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         She was right in front of you! What's 
                         wrong with you!?

               His fists clench. He seems about to lose control. He backs 
               GENE into a corner, physically terrified.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Are you 'fucking with me!?

                                     GENE
                         The gun...

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What about the gun?

                                     GENE
                         It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the 
                         bullets in it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You...

               He raises a fist. Struggles with the impulse to smash GENE, 
               controls it. Angrily, he takes the gun from GENE's pocket, 
               expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.
 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You won't get many chances like that, 
                         Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. 
                         Don't blow the next one.

               He indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes. 
               GENE looks out and down.

               GENE'S POV

               The van. It's moving into a parking spot across from the 
               Bonaventure, on Flower Street.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:29PM

               LYNN is coloring a picture in her stolen book. MS. JONES 
               takes a look.

                                     MS. JONES
                         That's pretty good.

                                     LYNN
                         I've done much better ones than this.

                                     MS. JONES
                         You have, huh?

                                     LYNN
                         Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much 
                         more colors at home.

                                     MS. JONES
                         That's good.
                              (checks her watch)
                         That's good, sweetie pie.

               INT. RED ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:29PM

               The elevator continues its descent and the van disappears 
               from view. GENE strains to see it again, but it's impossible.

               MR. SMITH jams the loaded gun into GENE's pocket.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         There, all loaded. Ready for the 
                         hunt.

               The elevator, doors open into the lobby.


               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - YELLOW ELEVATOR LOBBY - 
               DAY - 12:29PM

               MR. SMITH walks out. GENE follows. MR. SMITH, suddenly becomes 
               self-conscious, walks away from GENE. The object of his 
               shyness: A JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE nearby. The man is taping 
               his wife with a video camera.

               VIEW THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA - 12:31PM

               We see what the camera is seeing, the WIFE, smiling. Behind 
               her, we see GENE, looking confusedly after Mr. Smith.  He 
               turns, walks out of frame. In the corner of the picture, a 
               read-out of the TIME:

               12:31:00.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:31PM

               Back in real life, GENE walks toward a shoeshine stand outside 
               the Men's Room. "Huey's Polished Act" and below that, hand-
               lettered, "Disabled Veteran" where HUEY himself, a fiftyish 
               black man, reads a "Smithsonian" magazine.

               He sees GENE and perks up - a customer.

                                     HUEY
                         Having a rough day? Down at the heels 
                         as they...?

               But GENE goes right past HUEY and into the Men's Room.

                                     HUEY
                              (calling after him)
                         You don't see your face, you don't 
                         pay!

               HUEY gives up, goes back to his magazine.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM. - DAY - 12:31PM

               Gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, 
               splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes.  
               He tries to find an answer, a way out. A pay phone, on the 
               wall behind him, comes into focus. Then a hand reaches in, 
               grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire.  Gene 
               spins around.  It is MR. SMITH, of course.
 

               MR. SMITH smiles. GENE doesn't. MR. SMITH leaves.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY

               GENE exits the Men's Room and walks back the route he came.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 12:32PM

               HUEY sets down his magazine again.

                                     HUEY
                         Having a rough day? Down at the heels 
                         as they say? What you need is a shoe 
                         shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

               It's HUEY's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times. 
               GENE looks around.

               MR. SMITH is in the lounge area, facing the Flower Street 
               entrance, able to keep the Men's Room and GENE in view.

                                     HUEY
                         Take ten, take a break, take a seat, 
                         take a load off. Put the world in 
                         perspective.

               GENE lets HUEY usher him into a chair.

               The gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the 
               chair. A grim reminder. He pulls out the itinerary.

               ECU - ITINERARY

               12:45  -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant  -  Pacific Rim 
               Multi-Cultural Conference  -  Pool Deck  -  Fourth Floor

               GENE looks at his watch.

               ECU WATCH

               12:32.

               The minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches.

               ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM

               He works away at GENE's shoes.
 

                                     HUEY
                         So, are you a visitor or lucky enough 
                         to live in The City of Angels?

               It's more of HUEY's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.

                                     GENE
                         I'm...I'm visiting.

               GENE watches MR. SMITH frown and amble toward the shoeshine 
               stand.

                                     HUEY
                         What do you do, if I may be so bold?

                                     GENE
                              (looking at MR. SMITH)
                         I'm just an accountant.

                                     HUEY
                         Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. 
                         Where would the government be without 
                         accountants?  They wouldn't know how 
                         hard they can squeeze us before we 
                         pop, isn't that right?

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:33PM

               He takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his 
               chair.

               ANGLE ON HUEY - 12:33PM

                                     HUEY
                         Now you take tips. Time was a tip 
                         was between a man and his customer. 
                         Not any more. They've figured out 
                         what they call a formulae, don't 
                         laugh, it ain't for babies. They 
                         take your sales, see, and slap a 
                         percentile on there, figuring that 
                         somewhere between your lies and your 
                         bad luck they'll hit on the mean 
                         amount, mean meaning "in the middle", 
                         but if you ask me it means "just 
                         plain mean". Why you can have Uncle 
                         Scrooge wring a nickel over your 
                         poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy 
                         Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins 
                         like manna from heaven, don't make 
                         no difference, they'll tax your behind 
                         according to that same figure. Doesn't 
                         seem quite right., does it?
 

                                     GENE
                         No. No, it doesn't.

               The Bellboy GUSTINO walks by, calls out to HUEY.

                                     GUSTINO
                         Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?

                                     HUEY
                         It's a load, my friend, but somebody's 
                         got to carry it.

               GUSTINO laughs, waves.

                                     GENE
                         I have to do something.

                                     HUEY
                         What's that? You have to speak up.
                              (taps his ear)
                         I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between 
                         that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. 
                         Compliments of the United States 
                         Army Artillery Corps.

                                     GENE
                         I said I have to do something.

                                     HUEY
                         I'll have you out of here in two 
                         shakes o'f a lamb's tail.

                                     GENE
                         Is within himself.

               GENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here. 
               She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of 
               numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists all 
               over the house.

               HUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his 
               chair?


                                     GENE
                         Drove me crazy. There must have been 
                         one on me. I didn't add up so she 
                         left. That's what attracted me to 
                         her In the first place. She made up 
                         her mind and she did it. She wouldn't 
                         sit around waiting for...whatever. 
                         She'd do something. She'd do 
                         something.

               HUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a live 
               one.

                                     HUEY
                         Yes, well, you know, for a quality 
                         shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. 
                         Wears like iron. You're a wise man. 
                         There ya' go. Two bucks.

               HUEY gestures for GENE to get down. GENE steps to the floor. 
               He pays HUEY with a twenty.

                                     HUEY
                         You got anything smaller?

                                     GENE
                         Keep it.

                                     HUEY
                         It's a twenty.

                                     GENE
                         Keep it.

               GENE is thinking about something.

                                     HUEY
                         Well...thanks muchly...

               GENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street 
               entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket.

                                     GENE
                         Can I get out to Flower Street from 
                         here?

                                     HUEY
                         Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you 
                         right out there.


               HUEY nods toward the bar.

                                     GENE
                         Thanks.

               GENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for 
               the boys in white.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:35PM

               GENE looks towards the Flower Street entrance. The van is 
               still there. A bus pulls up.

               GENE walks past MR. SMITH.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You get another chance in ten minutes.

                                     GENE
                         Then I have time for a drink.

               He heads up to the bar.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         All right, Mr. Watson, but make it 
                         just one. I don't want you...

               But GENE is long gone.

               INT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM

               GENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just 
               returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting 
               sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where 
               MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked.

                                     REPORTER
                         So where was I?

                                     BARTENDER
                         I don't know. Something about the 
                         Governor's new regime.

               GENE hears this and glances towards them.

                                     REPORTER
                         Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old 
                         Boys like yesterday's newspapers.


               GENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the 
               lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street.

                                     REPORTER
                         The white boys are in for it. When 
                         they got her elected they never 
                         thought she was gonna make the 
                         Governor's office look like the United 
                         Nations.

               The BARTENDER laughs. GENE quickly cuts across the lobby and 
               out the smaller door onto Flower Street.

                                     REPORTER
                         We're talking Custer's Last Stand 
                         here. The only minorities not on her 
                         staff are the ones still lost in the 
                         Rain Forest.

               EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY - 12:3 6PM

               GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving 
               through the traffic.

               Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping 
               low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door, 
               one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on 
               the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks 
               inside the cab.

               No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces 
               himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks 
               out the gun.

               INT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM

               The first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched 
               out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead.

                                     GENE
                              (a gasp)
                         Lynn!

                                     MS. JONES (O.S.)
                         Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.

               MS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on. 
               GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles.


                                     MS. JONES
                              (softly)
                         What we have here is what they call 
                         a Mexican standoff. The thing you 
                         gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind 
                         the seat?"  Now, a twenty-two'd go 
                         right through it, but even a button 
                         will throw a twenty-two off so there's 
                         a good chance it'd get screwed up 
                         somewhere along the way, miss the 
                         target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A 
                         thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight,
                         unless it hits metal, then it'll 
                         bust up in little bitty pieces. 
                         They'll keep going but they'll be 
                         slowed down quite a bit. How's about 
                         a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through 
                         the seat, her, you, the dashboard, 
                         shit, it'll go through the engine 
                         block before it knows it's hit 
                         anything, end up in some pedestrian 
                         three blocks away. What do you think? 
                         What's my poison?

               GENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. 
               He lowers the gun, defeated.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Well it's a comfort to know you've 
                         got the co-Jones to pull that thing 
                         out. Whether you've got the balls to 
                         pull the trigger we've still got to 
                         see.

               EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY

               GENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The 
               gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's 
               holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:38PM

               MS. JONES puts her gun down, raises a walkie-talkie.

                                     MS. JONES
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         He's coming back in.


                                     MR. SMITH
                              (filtered)
                         I've got him in the crosshairs.

               INT. BUFFET AREA - DAY - 12:38PM

               MR. SMITH near the entrance, eating some food. He watches

               GENE walk past him. Their eyes meet.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:39PM

               GENE looks at his watch, then checks the itinerary once more.

               ECU - ITINERARY

               12:45 -  Governor Eleanor Samara Grant - Pacific Kim Multi-
               Cultural Conference - Pool Deck - Fourth Floor

               ANGLE ON GENE-NEAR BUFFET AREA - 12:39PM

               GENE addresses another Bellboy, HECTOR who is moving luggage 
               out to the street.

                                     GENE
                         Pool Deck?

                                     HECTOR
                         Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.

               GENE thanks him and moves across the lobby MR. SMITH follows 
               GENE

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - BAR AREA - DAY - 12:39PM

               GENE heads toward the escalators. Ahead of him, he sees 
               ELEANOR GRANT and BRENDAN GRANT surrounded by AIDES and 
               SECURITY MEN facing a crowd of PRESS PEOPLE. The Governor 
               and her husband have an arm around each other. They are 
               smiling, relaxed, quite the" happy couple. They give each 
               other a warm kiss. Camera flashes, recording the moment.

               GENE, heading toward them, has to thread his way through a 
               large WEDDING PARTY - tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns. When he 
               clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference.


               ANGLE ON BRENDAN GRANT - 12:3 9PM

               He is now alone in front of a campaign poster, fielding 
               questions from a few remaining REPORTERS.

               Farther on, ELEANOR GRANT and her entourage can be seen taking 
               the escalator up. GENE heads that way, passing BRENDAN GRANT.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         My wife is not interested in negative 
                         campaigning. She wants to accentuate 
                         the positive. I don't know about you 
                         but I find that refreshing.

                                     A REPORTER
                         Have you ever thought of running for 
                         office yourself?

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (smiles, charmingly)
                         Me?

               A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN walks by. The Governor's husband's eyes 
               follow her appreciatively as he says:

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         I'm just a business man.

               ANGLE ON GENE - 12:40PM

               He nears the escalator. It's crowded and GENE is pulled into 
               the midst of NEWS PEOPLE, TV, RADIO, PRESS. He joins the 
               flow and lets it pull him along.

               GENE rides the escalator to the Second Floor and follows the 
               crowd up two flights of the circular stairs.

               Down a short tunnel and out onto the Pool Deck.

               EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - POOL, DECK - HIGH ANGLE - 12:41PM

               About an acre of grass on the Fourth Floor. Skyways connect 
               the Pool Deck to the office buildings across Flower and 
               Figueroa. A platform has been set up with chairs and 
               microphones in front of a podium.


               EXT. POOL DECK - CLOSE ANGLE ON GENE - 12:41PM

               GENE blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. When his eyes 
               adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching A 
               SECURITY MAN with a hand-held metal detector. He panics, 
               turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along, 
               trapped. The line shuffles forward. He turns, determined to 
               make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a 
               2ND SECURITY MAN, who waves him to one side.

               2ND SECURITY MAN Excuse me, sir, You don't have to wait. I 
               can take you over here.

               GENE is dragged forward. He looks around; no way out. He 
               stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of 
               his body, is lifted over to the other. Down it slides, toward 
               the pocket concealing the gun. GENE waits for the alarm -
               which doesn't come. The SECURITY MAN operating the gizmo 
               deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. GENE is pushed 
               on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:

               PRESS by the dozens. Eleanor Samara Grant SUPPORTERS by the 
               hundreds. SECURITY MEN and COPS IN UNIFORM. GENE moves through 
               them, trying to figure out what just happened. He glances 
               back to the 2ND SECURITY MAN, and bumps into one particular 
               POLICE OFFICER, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts 
               with a quick laugh.

               POLICE OFFICER Easy, sir. Got to watch where you're going in 
               a crowd like this.

               He is a handsome, solid-looking guy. You'd trust him. Call 
               him OFFICER TRUST. OFFICER TRUST seems to be in charge. He 
               moves off through the crowd, giving LOCAL POLICE orders in 
               an easy way.

               GENE looks around. He can't see MR. SMITH. He edges his way 
               after OFFICER TRUST, who reaches the wall beyond which is 
               the drop to the street. He leans there comfortably, scanning 
               the crowd, GENE reaches the wall a few yards away from him. 
               He looks out at the city, getting his courage up. Just as he 
               turns to approach OFFICER TRUST:


                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)
                         I know what you're thinking.

               GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him. 
               He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.

                                     GENE
                         What would you do in my place?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Me?

               He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         The bitch would be dead. Course I 
                         ain't sayin' which bitch.

               He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie-
               talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the 
               sidewalk four stories below.

               MR. SMITH goes ballistic.

               GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST.

                                     GENE
                         There's a plot to kill the Governor. 
                         If you don't believe me, check that 
                         guy right there. He has a gun.

               OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         So do you, Mr. Watson.

               And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie-
               Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         You got this under control?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yeah.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         It doesn't look like it.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         It's under control.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         It better be.

               OFFICER TRUST walks away.

               MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie-
               talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him 
               to an isolated corner.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I oughta throw you after that walkie-
                         talkie but I'm going to give you a 
                         break because you're an amateur.

                                     WAITER M (O.S.)
                         Gentlemen...

               The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.

               GENE shakes his head.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.

               GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         There was this guy. Big guy. Irish-
                         Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, 
                         jolly son-of-a-bitch.

               We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Nobody could make me laugh like him. 
                         We closed more bars together than I 
                         can count. He was my pal. I loved 
                         that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to 
                         say it. But he was fuck-up. He had 
                         this image of himself. Thought he 
                         was con man. Always trying to shave 
                         the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always 
                         miss him. Tell me why.


                                     GENE
                         What...?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Tell me why I miss him.

                                     GENE
                         He's dead?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's right. He's dead. Tell me 
                         why.

                                     GENE
                         How should I...?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Tell me why he's dead.

               GENE stares at him for a beat.

                                     GENE
                         You killed him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's right, I killed him. He fucked 
                         up one too many times so I put a 
                         bullet in his eye. Then I put two 
                         more into him just to make sure. Now 
                         that was somebody I loved.

               He moves in on GENE, crowding him. He breathes hard, looks 
               like one insane piece of work.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I loved that motherfucker but I got 
                         the call and I put him down like a 
                         sick animal. So if you've got any 
                         doubts about what's going to happen 
                         if you don't deliver let me tell you 
                         something. I'd make gravy out of 
                         your little girl just to season that 
                         black Irish cocksucker's meat.

               A wave of applause catches their attention.


               ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

               She and her entourage enter the Pool Deck and walk toward 
               the platform. ELEANOR GRANT gladhands people on the way.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - 12:45PM

               He turns' back to GENE.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Do what you're supposed to do. Do it 
                         now.

               He grabs GENE and gives him a push. There is a general 
               movement in the crowd toward the platform. GENE is buffeted 
               along. MR. SMITH follows him, keeping him in sight, but then 
               a PACK OF PHOTOGRAPHERS move in, start snapping, lifting 
               their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. MR. SMITH 
               instinctively turns away, hiding his face. He moves around 
               the PHOTOGS and finds himself separated from GENE by the 
               mob. He searches, trying to spot him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Shit!

               ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM

               In the crowd, GENE is bumped this way and that. His face 
               displays an inner devastation. His eyes focus desperately on 
               something ahead:

               It is the back of ELEANOR GRANT'S head. She is turning this 
               way and that, greeting supporters.

               GENE's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. He is at 
               the end of his rope. He is going to do it.

               ANGLE ON ROSTRUM

               A local POLITICO mounts the platform, taps the microphone.

               LOCAL POLITICO Can I have your attention Please! Please 
               welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished Mayor 
               of Los Angeles.  The honorable Tom Bradley.

               The CROWD reacts loudly, yells and whistles. GENE-pushes his 
               way forward.


                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         It is my extreme pleasure this 
                         afternoon to introduce to you...

               ANGLE ON GENE - 12:4 6PM

               He is now a few yards from ELEANOR GRANT. He comes up against 
               the SECURITY MAN who gave him the once-over with the metal 
               detector. The man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away. 
               He nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the CROWD.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         ...a woman who can only be 
                         characterized as a one-of-a-kind.

               GENE is close to ELEANOR GRANT. She is just a few bodies 
               away, visible between them. His hand moves in his pocket. He 
               swallows. The impulse sweeps over him and...

                                     KRISTA (O.S.)
                         Feeling better?

               KRISTA BROOKS, the young woman from the elevator is next to 
               him, smiling. He looks at her in confusion.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         An iconoclast with class...

                                     KRISTA
                         The elevator. You weren't feeling 
                         well.

               GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         A genuine lady who's not afraid to 
                         get into the trenches...

                                     KRISTA
                         Are you better now?

               GENE turns, scans the crowd - no sign of MR. SMITH.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         ...and go to the mat with greedy 
                         special interests...

               GENE looks at KRISTA, studies her intensely. She's a bit 
               unnerved.


                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         The finest Governor our state has 
                         ever had...

               Again GENE looks at ELEANOR GRANT. She's turning around, 
               facing the crowd, facing him.

                                     TOM BRADLEY
                         My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor 
                         Grant!

               ELEANOR GRANT raises her arms. A perfect target. The CROWD 
               roars as GENE turns back to KRISTA. He leans into her, speaks.

                                     GENE
                         My wife always said I had a problem 
                         trusting people.

                                     KRISTA
                         Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara 
                         Grant.

                                     GENE
                         You don't understand. I'm going to 
                         trust you. And you have to trust me.

               Krista looks at Gene.

                                     KRISTA
                         Yes, you're right, I don't understand.

                                     GENE
                         Look...my daughter ... she's going 
                         to die...unless you can help me.

               Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously 
               a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case 
               nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help.

                                     KRISTA
                         Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me 
                         get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist 
                         you, he's our...

               Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only, 
               unnoticed by anyone else.


                                     GENE
                              (sotto voce)
                         No! You have to listen to me.

               Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene.

                                     KRISTA
                         I'm listening, I'm listening.

               ANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM

               ELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming 
               LOCAL POLITICO.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         My friends, my good friends...

               ANGLE ON THE CROWD

               Gene and Krista are gone.

               EXT. BEHIND THE PLATFORM - DAY - 12:47PM

               Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe 
               of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the 
               pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a 
               ringing speech, accented with applause.

                                     GENE
                         Please...please...you have to believe 
                         me... They have my daughter.  They 
                         want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or 
                         they'll kill my daughter.

               KRISTA tries to edge away.

                                     KRISTA
                         All right, let's just...let's get 
                         security in on this.

                                     GENE
                         No! You can't! They're in on it.

                                     KRISTA
                         I don't see how they could be in on 
                         it. They're the best. They're hand-
                         picked.
 

                                     GENE
                         I don't know. One of them is following 
                         me. If he knew what I'd just told 
                         you they'd...

               GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking 
               he's going to shoot her.

                                     GENE
                         Look, how did I get in here with 
                         this!?

               KRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact.

                                     KRISTA
                         I don't know.

                                     GENE
                         You've got to trust me. I'm putting 
                         my daughter's life in your hands. 
                         She's only six. She's just a little 
                         girl. Please, please, trust me.

                                     KRISTA
                         It's a little hard to trust you under 
                         the circumstances.

               GENE looks at her intently.

                                     GENE
                         You're right, it is.
                              (beat)
                         Here.

               GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the 
               least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her 
               fingers.

                                     GENE
                         Will you trust me now?

               She stares at the gun, at the strange man.

                                     KRISTA
                         I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's 
                         one person we can go to.
 

                                     GENE
                         The man following me has a walkie-
                         talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll 
                         call his partner. I do anything out 
                         of line and he'll send the word to 
                         kill my daughter.

                                     KRISTA
                         He'll think you're in the crowd until 
                         the end of the speech. Wait a minute.

               She steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S 
               voice is heard.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
                         ...I remember that horrible night as 
                         if it were yesterday. A phone call 
                         pulling me out of sleep, the terrible 
                         news...

               KRISTA checks her watch.

               12:48.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.)
                         My husband and child senselessly 
                         killed by a drunk driver.

                                     KRISTA
                         We've got about ten minutes.

                                     GENE
                         Are you sure?

                                     KRISTA
                         I've heard this speech a lot. Come 
                         on. We'll take care of him.  We will.

                                     GENE
                         But...

                                     KRISTA
                         Trust me. You asked me for help. Let 
                         me help. Trust me.

                                     GENE
                         Okay...

               She starts to lead him away.
 

                                     GENE
                         Hey.

               He stops her, points to the gun she still holds.

                                     GENE
                         I think you better put that away.

                                     KRISTA
                         I think you're right.

               She pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it 
               out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away.

               EXT. POOL DECK - DAY - 12:4 9PM

               MR. SMITH still roams the crowd, looking for Gene.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy 
                         us, has a curious way of giving us 
                         strength.

               He sees OFFICER TRUST who gives him a questioning look. He 
               ignores it.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I doubt if I would be before you 
                         now, if I hadn't been put through 
                         that crucible of loss.

               MR SMITH notices the JAPANESE TOURIST COUPLE we met before. 
               The man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle.  
               MR. SMITH glances up toward what the man is shooting. 
               Consternation and anger fill his face.

               ANGLE ON RED BONAVENTURE TOWER - 12:4 9PM

               What he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising. KRISTA 
               stands at the glass looking down. Behind her, just glimpsed, 
               is GENE.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         And though I can never forget William 
                         and Bill Junior or the love I felt 
                         for them...


               MR. SMITH cuts a wake through the CROWD.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I have found joy again in serving 
                         this great state. I have found love 
                         again in my second husband Brendan...

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - DAY - 12:.50PM

               The elevator doors open. GENE and KRISTA bolt out and hurry 
               down the hall.

                                     GENE
                         Where are we going?

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 12:50PM

               KRISTA leads GENE past the SECURITY GUARD stationed in the 
               hallway at a small table. GENE tries to keep his face turned 
               away. The GUARD glances up.

                                     HALL GUARD
                         Ms. Brooks ...

                                     KRISTA
                         Is he in?

                                     HALL GUARD
                         Yes, ma'am.

               They walk past him. He's a bit curious about GENE, but shrugs 
               it off.

               GENE and KRISTA reach a door and knock.

                                     GENE
                         Who is this? Are you sure we can 
                         trust him?

                                     KRISTA
                         I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her 
                         Campaign Manager.

               The door opens. BRENDAN GRANT is framed there.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         What is it? Is there a problem?
 

                                     KRISTA
                         We need to see you, Brendan.

               She grabs GENE and pushes inside.

               INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:51PM

               Upscale suite. BRENDAN GRANT'S coat is draped on a chair. 
               KRISTA moves past him, pulling GENE.

                                     GENE
                              (to KRISTA)
                         We have to hurry.

                                     KRISTA
                         I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone 
                         is trying to kill Eleanor.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         What? What are you talking about?

                                     KRISTA
                         We need people we can "trust. We 
                         only have a few moments...

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         This is...this is insane. How do you 
                         know this?

                                     GENE
                         I know it because I'm the one who's 
                         supposed to kill her.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         You are!?
                              (to KRISTA)
                         You brought this man here!? You 
                         brought this man to my room!?

                                     KRISTA
                         I had to. Her Security people may be 
                         involved...

               There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent 
               bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands 
               on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, 
               perhaps wearing glasses.
 

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Is there a problem, Brendan?

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         There certainly is. This man says 
                         he's been hired to kill Eleanor.

                                     GENE
                         Not hired. They're blackmailing me.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Who is this "they"?

                                     GENE
                         I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. 
                         Grant! They have my daughter. I'm 
                         not some lunatic. Your wife is in 
                         trouble.  Someone is trying to kill 
                         her. Someone is trying to make me 
                         kill her. Please, listen...

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         And on the strength of this story, 
                         you bring this man to Brendan's suite?  
                         Does that show good judgment, Ms. 
                         Brooks?  I'm just a friend of 
                         Brendan's, but it seems to me...

                                     KRISTA
                         He brought a gun onto the pool deck.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                              (beat)
                         What?

                                     KRISTA
                         He got onto the pool deck with a 
                         gun. How did he get past her Security 
                         carrying a

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         I see. Where is this gun?

                                     KRISTA I
                         Have it.


                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Well, is it real? Do we know anything 
                         about it?

                                     KRISTA
                         It looks real. I don't know anything 
                         about guns.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Could I see it?

               KRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands 
               it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it 
               awkwardly, examines it.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         My goodness. It certainly looks real.

               He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         What's your opinion? You're the expert 
                         in these matters, supposedly.

               GENE turns, to see who he is talking to.

               ANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM

               MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak, 
               MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He 
               marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the 
               couch. He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and 
               goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder 
               what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock 
               fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand 
               there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (calmly, staring at 
                              GENE)
                         Yeah, I'd say it's real.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Are you out of your fucking mind!?


               The door opens. OFFICER TRUST slides in quickly.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         Somebody mind telling me...
                              (sees KRISTA's body))
                         What the hell happened!?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Help me get her off the rug.

               OFFICER TRUST checks the hall, shuts the door. They begin to 
               drag her body to the bathroom. The MYSTERY MAN watches.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         What have you done to me!? Christ 
                         almighty!

               GENE's eyes follow them. As if rousing from a sleep he comes 
               to life.

                                     GENE
                         No!

               He tries to rush to the bathroom but MR. SMITH is right there, 
               gripping him. GENE struggles frantically, uselessly, watching 
               the bathroom door close. MR. SMITH is beyond anger. He grabs 
               GENE'S throat, muscles down. GENE grips the iron hand that's 
               cutting off his air.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You fucked up.

                                     MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)
                         That's enough.

               The MYSTERY MAN grabs MR. SMITH'S arm, tries to pry him loose. 
               MR. SMITH is beyond reason.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You want me to kill your kid!? You 
                         want me to kill you!?

               GENE's eyes begin to roll back in his head. Everything begins 
               fading to black.

               The blackness retreats in a rush and GENE finds himself 
               staring at the butt of MR. SMITH'S gun, visible under his 
               coat. He reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank 
               into
 

               MR. SMITH, again, again. MR. SMITH'S shocked face falls away. 
               GENE heads for the door.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Don't let him go!

               OFFICER TRUST steps between GENE and the door. GENE shoots 
               him down and is out the door.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE stumbles out in the hall, gun in hand. He hurries down 
               the hall, looking back to see the MYSTERY MAN and a wounded 
               OFFICER TRUST spill out of Room 2503. The HALL OFFICER pulls 
               his weapon MYSTERY MAN Get him!

               GENE fires at the HALL OFFICER who goes down. GENE rushes 
               down the hall. One of the guest room door's opens and a MAN 
               staggers out. It is a bloody, wounded MR. SMITH! GENE stops 
               in shock.

                                     GENE
                         I killed you.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You fucked up.

               And MR. SMITH grabs him by the collar and throws him over a 
               railing.

               INT. THE LOBBY - MID-AIR - DAY

               GENE is falling, falling. He passes the ascending elevator 
               and gets a glimpse of MS. JONES and LYNN, pressed against 
               the glass, her face a mask of terror. The floor rushes up to 
               meet GENE and...

               INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:5 6PM

               ...he hits the floor, thrown there by MR. SMITH. His escape 
               has been a dream. A wrist-watch fills the frame.

               12:56.


               It is GENE's. We are seeing his P.O.V. He's laying on the 
               floor, his watch-hand in front of his face.

                                     MYSTERY MAN (O.S.)
                         You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!

                                     MR. SMITH (O.S.)
                         Nearly doesn't count.

               Lose the P.O.V.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         I'm on record. I never wanted this. 
                         I wanted simplicity; a telescopic 
                         sight, a powerful rifle, but no. 
                         What was good enough for Oswald wasn't 
                         good enough for you two. You had to 
                         get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off 
                         the street, stick a gun in his hand.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         It's academic now. She had to be 
                         killed.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What were you going to do, Brendan? 
                         Lock her in a closet?  You're in the 
                         fucking kitchen now. Get used to the 
                         heat. He's been seen all over the 
                         hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes. 
                         We even got him on video. It'll work. 
                         Don't worry about it.

               GENE stirs on the floor.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         (about GENE) Is he awake?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Yeah.

               He yanks GENE to his feet.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Oh Great. Why don't we just give him 
                         our home phone numbers while we're 
                         at it?


                                     MR. SMITH
                         It doesn't matter what he hears.

               He pulls GENE over to the bathroom door. Throws it open. 
               GENE reacts to what he sees within.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's what it looks like. She was 
                         alive a minute ago. Now she's dead. 
                         Because you wouldn't do what I told 
                         you to do.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Get going. You've only got a few 
                         minutes to pull it together.

               MR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall.  The 
               door closes. Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are 
               alone BRENDAN GRANT I don't know if we should go through 
               with this.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         It's too late for that.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         There is a dead woman on my bathroom 
                         floor!

                                     MYSTERY MAM
                         What about it? She's Eleanor's 
                         assistant and they will have been 
                         shot with the same gun, by the same 
                         lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who 
                         went over the edge.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (breathing easier)
                         Only thing better would be if he 
                         were a postal worker.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         He won't be doing any work once I 
                         get through with him.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         And in a few months you're in the 
                         Governor's mansion. The people'd 
                         make you king of California if they 
                         could.
 

               BRENDAN GRANT laughs.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 12:57PM

               OFFICER TRUST exits from the room and engages the HALL OFFICER 
               in conversation down the hall. GENE and MR. SMITH turns the 
               other way, walk. In an undertone:

                                     GENE
                         I'm not stupid.. I know how this is 
                         supposed, to work.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Do you now, Mr. Watson?

                                     GENE
                         I kill her - and you kill me.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Keep your voice down.

                                     GENE
                         Even if you don't, Her Security men 
                         will.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 12:58PM

               They reach the elevator. MR. SMITH punches the button. GENE 
               turns on him.

                                     GENE
                         How am I supposed to get away?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's not my problem, Mr. Watson

               He gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         Come back.

                                     GENE
                         How do I know you won't kill my 
                         daughter once I'm gone?


                                     MR. SMITH
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         Come Back....Fucking Radio.

               MR. SMITH is getting nothing but static. He angrily keys 
               off, hisses at GENE:

                                     MR.SMITH
                         I told you she'd be alright, if you 
                         do your job.

                                     GENE
                         And I'm supposed to trust you?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         What choice do you have?

               The elevator doors open. MR. SMITH gestures graciously.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         After you.

               INT. "BLUE" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:58PM

               They step into the elevator. Stare at each other. The doors 
               close. MR. SMITH erupts. He grabs GENE slams him into the 
               outside window. GENE's face is smashed into the glass by MR. 
               SMITH'S shoulder. His body presses GENE against the glass 
               wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from GENE's ear.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Look out there! You see the van?

               The van can be seen below on Flower Street.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You see it?!

               WHAM! He slams GENE's head against the window. He lifts up 
               the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Come back.


                                     MS. JONES (V.O.)
                              (filtered)
                         Yeah.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Do it!

               He jabs the walkie-talkie next to GENE's ear.

                                     LYNN (V.O.)
                              (filtered)
                         Daddy...?

               And then a scream. The horrible sound of a little girl in 
               terrible pain. It cuts through GENE like a stab in the heart.

                                     GENE
                         Lynn!

               He struggles to turn around. MR. SMITH kidney punches him, 
               hard! GENE goes down on one knee.

               The car stops. SOMEONE starts to board it, stops in surprise. 
               MR. SMITH sticks a badge in their face.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Security. Take the next car.

               They back off. The doors close, the car continues its descent.

               MR. SMITH lifts the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Again.

                                     GENE
                              (a gasp)
                         No, please...

               Another bone-chilling scream from the walkie-talkie. GENE is 
               ripped to his soul. MR. SMITH hauls him to his feet, shoves 
               him against the glass.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You got one last chance. Half an 
                         hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill 
                         her myself. I'll rip her fucking 
                         head off right in front of you!


               MR. SMITH releases GENE, who goes limp. The elevator doors 
               open onto the lobby.

               MR. SMITH gets out, straightening his tie, wiping the sweat 
               from his face.

               INT. THIRD FLOOR "GREEN" ELEVATOR LOBBY - DAY - 12:59PM

               GENE gets out of the elevator, almost getting caught in the 
               closing doors. He can't even fight back at the doors. They 
               pound him a couple of times before he is able to step clear 
               of the elevator. GENE stifles a retch, hurries away.

               MR. SMITH is standing there. Childish giggles erupt from the 
               walkie-talkie.

                                     LYNN (O.S.)
                              (filtered, giggling)
                         Daddy, did you hear me scream?

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:00PM

               MS. JONES holds the walkie-talkie for LYNN.

                                     LYNN (O.S.)
                         She told me to scream as loud as I 
                         could. Did you hear me?

               OMIT

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:01PM

               GENE staggers over to the row of sinks. Leaning on one sink 
               with both hands, his body shudders violently. And he throws 
               up.

               A man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks. He 
               sees GENE retching, turns away in disgust, and leaves quickly.

               GENE turns on the faucets.to wash the mess away.

               He tries to clean up, but catches his reflection in the 
               mirror. He has trouble looking himself in the eye.
 

               INT. THIRD FLOOR LOBBY - DAY - 1:01PM

               MR. SMITH is fuming. Into the walkie-talkie:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         The next time I tell you to do 
                         something, you goddamn well do it!

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:01PM

               MS. JONES tries to be private on the walkie-talkie.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit 
                         a screaming kid in traffic, come out 
                         here and do it yourself. He got the 
                         message, didn't he?

               LYNN watches her, knowing something's not quite right.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - EXT MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:02PM

               GENE comes out of the Men's Room, stands there at a loss.

                                     HUEY (O.S.)
                         Having a rough day? Down at the heels 
                         as they say? What you need is a shoe 
                         shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

               GENE looks around. HUEY has his nose in his magazine, calling 
               out his patter for whoever drifts by.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:02PM

               GENE walks over, climbs into a chair.

                                     HUEY
                              (still not looking up)
                         Take ten, take a break, take a seat, 
                         take a load off. Put the world in 
                         perspective.

               GENE has settled into the chair. HUEY tosses the magazine 
               aside, swings into action...

                                     HUEY
                         So, are you a visitor or are you 
                         lucky enough to...
 

               ...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes.

                                     HUEY
                              (as he looks up)
                         You got a complaint?

               GENE looks down at him.

                                     GENE
                         You remember me?

                                     HUEY
                         I remember. The big tipper.

                                     GENE
                         Something is going to happen. When 
                         it's over you'll know what I was 
                         talking about.

                                     HUEY
                         Oh, man...

                                     GENE
                         Please. Something is going to 
                         happen...

                                     HUEY
                         What? The end of the world? Man, 
                         don't give me your mad rap. I'm not 
                         a bartender. I don't want to hear 
                         it. I raise a family doing this 
                         bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your 
                         crazy white ass out of my chair.

                                     GENE
                         Please...

                                     HUEY
                         Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the 
                         right to crap in my ear. You want 
                         change?  You got it, brother. What 
                         was that you gave me, a twenty?

               HUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up. 
               From behind him:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Come on, let's get some privacy.


                                     GENE
                         He's deaf.

               It spills out of GENE almost without volition. There's a 
               note of pleading hidden in it. GENE slowly points a thumb at 
               HUEY's "Disabled Veteran" sign.

                                     GENE
                         He can't hear a word we're saying.

               MR. SMITH looks at the sign. HUEY stops what he's doing -
               "What the fuck?" He almost says it aloud, then:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You wouldn't be kidding me now, would 
                         you, Mr. Watson?
                              (to HUEY's back)
                         Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't 
                         hear me? Nigger?

               HUEY's face settles into something cold. What's he going to 
               do?  He stands, looks at GENE, who stares back at him, then 
               slowly turns around, looks at MR. SMITH - and breaks into a 
               jive-ass grin.

                                     HUEY
                         Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient 
                         just got multiplied by two. What do 
                         you think of that?  You'll have to 
                         forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your 
                         approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm 
                         deef as a post. Compliments of the 
                         United States Army...
                              (does a snappy salute)
                         ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a 
                         shine, sir? You don't see your face, 
                         you don't pay.

               MR. SMITH is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (loudly)
                         Yeah, sure, give me a shine...
                              (looks at GENE)
                         ...shine.

               HUEY goes to work on his shoes.
 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I'm putting your toy back in your 
                         pocket, Mr. Watson.

               Unseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun being 
               transferred to GENE's pocket.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         It's all wound up. Now let's get out 
                         your itinerary.

               GENE does.

               "1:'30 - California Leads the Nation into the 21st Century -
               California Ballroom - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant and 
               Brendan Grant" It is the last entry.

                                     GENE
                         One thirty. California Ballroom.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (glances at HUEY)
                         That's right. That gives you...

               He looks at his watch.

               1:04.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         ...twenty-six minutes to get your 
                         shit together.

                                     GENE
                         Let me talk to her again.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         No. 

                                     GENE
                         I want'to talk to her.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Forget about it.


                                     GENE
                         I talk to her or you can forget about 
                         it.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Don't you threaten me.

                                     GENE
                         What are you going to do about it, 
                         shoot me?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         (glances again at HUEY) You know 
                         what I'm gonna do.

                                     GENE
                         What? Walk out there and twist her 
                         arm off?

               MR. SMITH doesn't reply.

                                     GENE
                         It would be a lot less trouble just 
                         to let me talk to her.

               They stare at each other for a few beats. Then MR. SMITH 
               checks HUEY out and gets out the walkie-talkie.

                                     MR. SMITH
                              (into it)

                         What gives? 

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Just put her on.

               GENE grabs the walkie-talkie.

                                     GENE
                         Yes, sweetie, it's me.

               MS. JONES holds the walkie-talkie for LYNN.

                                     LYNN
                         Can we go now?

               INT. BONAVENTURE LOBBY - DAY - 1:05PM

               MR. SMITH, GENE and HUEY in situ.

                                     GENE
                         No, honey, not to be a hero. But I 
                         want you to remember something for 
                         me, all right?

                                     LYNN (O.S.)
                              (filtered)
                         All right.

                                     GENE
                         He's doing it for you. No matter 
                         what anybody tells you, no matter 
                         who they are, he's doing it for you, 
                         because he loves you.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         That's enough.

               He reaches for the walkie-talkie, but GENE stares him down. 
               Back to the walkie-talkie:

                                     GENE
                         Will you promise me that?

               MR. SMITH grabs the walkie-talkie.

                         I don't care who the fuck you do it 
                         for just so you do it. Hey.

               He reaches down, snaps his fingers in HUEY's face. HUEY looks 
               up.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You done yet?

                         Just about.

               He gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away.

                                     HUEY
                         Two dollars, if it pleases you.


                                     MR. SMITH
                         It doesn't. I remember when it was a 
                         fuckin' quarter.

               He throws a couple dollars to HUEY. To GENE as he stalks 
               away:

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Twenty-five minutes.

               TO HIS BACK:

                                     HUEY
                         Thanks for the tip.

               HUEY turns back to GENE. They stare at each other.

                                     HUEY
                         Mister, what are you dragging me 
                         into?

                                     GENE
                         I'm not dragging you into anything. 
                         I don't expect...

                                     HUEY
                         Cover your mouth.

                                     GENE
                         What?

                                     HUEY
                         This gorilla's watching you, is that 
                         right?

                                     GENE
                         That's right.

                                     HUEY
                         Then don't let him be seeing you 
                         talking to me. I don't want him 
                         twisting my arm off.

               GENE lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. HUEY 
               pretends to work on his shoes.

                                     HUEY
                         That was your kid on the walkie-

                         There was a woman. She was trying to 
                         help me. I watched him murder her.

                                     HUEY
                         What are you supposed to do?

                         Kill the Governor.

               HUEY checks his perimeters, then:

                         I knew I should have packed up and 
                         gone home as soon as I got that 
                         twenty. What am I supposed to do 
                         about this situation?

                                     GENE
                         One of them is in on it. He might 
                         even be in charge. Her Security is 
                         in on it. There's only one person I 
                         know for sure isn't in on it.

                         The Governor. If I could just talk 
                         to her...

                         No way, there's nothing you can do 
                         to help me.

                         somehow...do right by my little girl.

               He gets out her picture, stares at it.

                                     GENE
                         It's about time I did. I was one of 
                         those guys, workaholics. I worked my 
                         ass off for them - my wife, my 
                         daughter.  That's just what I thought 
                         I was supposed to do.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah, all right, listen...

                                     GENE
                              (running on)
                         So when she wanted a divorce...I 
                         was...I didn't know what I'd done 
                         wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see 
                         it....

               HUEY takes his wooden brush and whacks GENE on the foot, 
               snapping him from his downward spiral.

                                     HUEY
                         Why don't you tell me about the early 
                         years some other time?

                                     GENE
                         I'm sorry. You understand I don't 
                         mind dying if I could save my 
                         daughter. I mean that.

                                     HUEY
                         Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with 
                         these shoes any more or it's gonna 
                         look funny. You go down get yourself 
                         something to drink. Make sure Godzilla 
                         there, follows you.

                                     GENE
                         What are you going to do?


                                     HUEY
                         I haven't the faintest idea. Go on 
                         now. I'll get word to you.

               GENE gets down.

                                     GENE
                         If nothing else, someone heard my 
                         story.

               He gives HUEY a twenty.

                                     GENE
                         Keep the change.

                                     HUEY
                         Don't think I won't.

               GENE just stands there. HUEY has to give him a little push.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:09PM

               GENE turns and walks across the lobby toward the bar. His 
               mind is racing. As he passes MR. SMITH...

                                     GENE
                         I need a drink.

               MR. SMITH rises immediately, looks back at HUEY. HUEY gives 
               him a symbolic tip of the hat. MR. SMITH follows GENE.

               INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY - 1:11PM

               GENE finds a stool at the empty part of the bar. The place 
               is half-full, noisy. The television is showing a game show.

               The BARTENDER comes over.

                                     GAME SHOW HOST (O.S.)
                              (over television)
                         ...and time is running out...

                                     GENE
                         Give me a ...a gingerale?

               MR. SMITH sits -at the other end of the bar. The BARTENDER 
               gets him a beer. GENE and MR. SMITH lock eyes in the mirror.  
               Between them, a couple of T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS are grabbing 
               a quick beer. A video camera resides on the bar by them.


               GENE notices OFFICER TRUST, walking by on a level above, 
               watching him.

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1
                         Man, I thought she was going to get 
                         out the violins.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         No shit. If I hear that stop the 
                         violence routine one more time I'm 
                         going to shoot somebody.

               A WAITRESS appears suddenly at GENE's elbow, surprising him. 
               She puts a basket of pretzels next to him and a coaster next 
               to his drink.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Here's your Ginger Ale, sir.

                                     DOWN THE BAR:

                         They're all the same.

               The WAITRESS is tapping a long fingernail against the bar.

               GENE looks down and sees it. A note on the coaster. "Men's 
               Room - Huey."

               The WAITRESS turns the coaster over, and leaves. GENE looks 
               down the bar at MR. SMITH, drinking, unaware.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         You know what bothers me?

               GENE looks at his watch.

               1:12.

                                     TV REPORTER

               GENE stands.

                                     GENE
                         Well, I'm just a regular guy.

               The T.V. NEWS TECHNICIANS stare at him.

                                     TV REPORTER
                         Is that right?

                                     GENE
                         Yeah, that's right. But I've built a 
                         good solid business out of nothing. 
                         Don't underestimate the regular guy.

               He heads for the open lobby.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Sir, you haven't paid.

                                     GENE
                         It's on the Special Interest at the 
                         end of the bar.

               GENE jerks a thumb at MR. SMITH and is gone. MR. SMITH starts 
               to follow him. The BARTENDER is right with him.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop.

               MR. SMITH slaps some money on the bar and leaves.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:13PM

               MR. SMITH scans the lobby trying to spot Gene. OFFICER TRUST 
               comes up behind him.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         Where is he? Did you lose him?

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Shut up.
 

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM

               Elsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be 
               clocks everywhere.

               A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the 
               time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris.

               The souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display, with the 
               logos of various LA sports teams.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - RESTAURANT AREA - DAY - 1:14PM

               The restaurant, the travel agency, the newsstand, all have 
               clocks.

               1:14 .

               Everywhere he turns. GENE has to look at his watch.

               1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once. 
               GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick 
               over one number in a thunderous chorus.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM

               He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the 
               chair - "Gone to Lunch" and there is a clock face with 
               moveable hands. "We'll be back at 1:30."

                                     GENE
                              (sotto voice)
                         Let's all hope so.

               And he enters the Men's Room.

               Across the lobby MR. SMITH spots him, heads that way.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM

               GENE enters to find HUEY and GUSTINO the Bellboy. HUEY runs 
               to the door, keeping a lookout.

                                     HUEY
                         Quick, off with the shoes and pants. 
                         Trade with Gustino. The big guy's 
                         coming.
 

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:16PM

               MR. SMITH marching towards the Men's Room.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM

               HUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other, 
               uncomfortable, to say the least.

                                     HUEY
                         C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.

               GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his 
               pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same. 
               GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small 
               for GUSTINO.

               GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door.

               HUEY comes back from the door.

                                     HUEY
                         Gustino! Drop 'em!

               GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's 
               pants still up. He drops them.

                                     HUEY
                         And cover up them socks. Man, who 
                         dresses you?

               HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only". 
               He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and 
               GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins 
               mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in.

               His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's 
               shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles.

               MR. SMITH smirks and leaves.

               The Janitor raps on GUSTINO's stall with the mop.

                                     JANITOR
                         Fue.  (Gone.)
 

               INT. SERVICE HALL - DAY - 1:17PM

               HUEY and GENE move down a drab service corridor. Boxes stacked 
               on both sides, floor buffers at rest, shelves with cleaning 
               supplies. GENE notices for the first time that HUEY has a 
               pronounced limp.

               They come upon IRENE the Cleaning Woman. She joins them moving 
               down the corridor.

                                     HUEY
                         Meet Irene.

                                     GENE
                         Hi.

                                     HUEY
                         Irene is going to help.

                                     GENE
                         Thank you.

               IRENE takes GENE's hand and leads him along at a half-trot.

                                     GENE
                         Where am I going?

               INT. BONAVENTURE - SERVICE ELEVATOR FOYER - DAY - 1:17PM

               They come through a short corridor and onto the service 
               elevator.

                                     HUEY
                         You said there was only one person 
                         you knew wasn't in on this thing.

                                     GENE
                         Yeah.

                                     HUEY
                         You're going to go see her.

                                     GENE
                         What!?

               The elevator doors close.
 

               INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAT - 1:17PM

               IRENE punches the button for the twenty-fifth floor.

                                     HUEY
                         You sure she's asleep?

                                     IRENE
                         I took up extra pillows. She take a 
                         nap before her big speech.

                                     GENE
                         What am I supposed to say to her?

                                     HUEY
                         It'll come to you. See if you can 
                         stop this thing 'fore it gets started. 
                         Save us all considerable 
                         embarrassment.

               HUEY takes a pillow and a blanket from IRENE'S cart and puts 
               it into GENE's arms IRENE You don't have to save me. I got 
               nothin' to do with it. You ain't gettin' no key from me.

                                     HUEY
                              (shocked)
                         Irene...?

               The service elevator stops. IRENE pushes her cart out into 
               the hall signalling them to stay put for a second. She starts 
               moving out into the hall, the card key falls on the floor.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM

               At the other end of the hall the HALL OFFICER turns when he 
               hears her approach.

               INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY -

               GENE and HUEY hover in the door of the service elevator. 
               Gene reaches down and snags the card key at his feet.
 

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:17PM

               The HALL OFFICER has to move his table aside so Irene can 
               pass with the cart. As he turns,

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               HUEY pushes GENE across the hall to the door of the Governors 
               bedroom.

               The Service Elevator door closes.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM     

               HALL OFFICER turns quickly at the noise.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE holds totally still in the alcove outside her room.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SECURITY TABLE - 1:18PM

               HALL OFFICER looks suspiciously, and finally sits back down.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE uses the key to let himself into

               INT. ROOM 2510 - 1:18PM

               Lit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the 
               bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a 
               pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands 
               over her, not knowing how to begin.

                                     GENE
                              (softly)
                         Excuse me...

               ELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Who the hell are you?

               She sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting 
               his hand on top of hers on top of the phone.
 

                                     GENE
                         No, please.

               They stare at each other for a beat.

               She bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up 
               to the bed.

               Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not 
               fearless.

                                     GENE
                         Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt 
                         you.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         My security people are right next 
                         door.

                                     GENE
                         I appreciate that.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         One loud scream will bring them in 
                         here instantly. You won't get very 
                         far. Think it over.

                                     GENE
                         If I were here to hurt you I would 
                         have done it already.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         That's...a comfort to hear.

                                     GENE
                         I have a problem.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Ah.

                                     GENE
                         Only you can help me. I'm also sorry 
                         to say, my problem is your problem, 
                         Mrs. Grant.

               She studies him.
 

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I remember you...in the elevator.

                                     GENE
                         That's right.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You were very nervous.

                                     GENE
                         It was because I had this...in my 
                         pocket

               He slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in.

                                     GENE
                         I need you to listen to me. Carefully. 
                         Three lives depend on you listening 
                         very carefully to what I have to 
                         say.

               She smiles.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                              (friendly as can be)
                         Of course. But suppose we set up an 
                         appointment. I have an important 
                         speech to deliver and you're cutting 
                         into my nap time.

               Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR 
               GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of 
               constituent...

                                     GENE
                         Krista Brooks is dead.

               She freezes, slowly replaces the phone.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         How do you know that?

                                     GENE
                         I saw her die. She was shot. With 
                         this gun.

               She turns to him.
 

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You shot her?

                                     GENE
                         No.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Who did?

                                     GENE
                         I don't know. The only thing I know 
                         about him is that he works for your 
                         husband.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What?

                                     GENE
                         And your husband works for somebody 
                         else.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What the hell are you saying?

               GENE glances at the bedside clock.

               1:19.

               He looks back to the Governor.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - THIRD FLOOR - DAY - 1:19PM

               An increasingly edgy MR. SMITH is looking at the Men's Room 
               door. He glances over to OFFICER TRUST who's keeping an eye 
               on him. He looks at his watch again, then gets up and heads 
               for the Men's Room.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:19PM

               MR. SMITH enters. HECTOR is at the urinal.

               MR. SMITH checks out the feet under the stall. He has to 
               bend over to check properly. GENE''s shoes, GENE' s pants 
               legs.

               HECTOR notices MR. SMITH'S actions.

               MR. SMITH is aware that he's been noticed, but he is very 
               suspicious.
 

               HECTOR flushes the urinal.

               MR. SMITH stays by the stall. He is going to look over the 
               top of the stall. He rises on his tiptoes.

               But HECTOR is staring at him like he's a pervert.

               MR. SMITH is suddenly embarrassed. He backs away from the 
               stall.

               HECTOR washes his hands, watching MR. SMITH in the mirror.

               MR. SMITH leaves.

               HECTOR dries his hands. He walks over to the stall and knocks 
               on the door.

                                     HECTOR
                         He's gone.

               And GUSTINO tosses a Bellboy jacket over the top of the stall. 
               HECTOR puts it on.

                                     HECTOR
                         Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? 
                         You need to eat more fiber.

                                     GUSTINO (O.S.)
                         You got anything to read?

               INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:21PM

               The clock on the nightstand.

               1:21.

               ELEANOR GRANT sits against the headboard. GENE sits on the 
               edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in 
               his hand.

                                     GENE
                         I knew you wouldn't believe me.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I said I'd listen to you, not 
                         necessarily believe you. You're 
                         telling me my people are in a plot 
                         against me. You're telling me my 
                         husband wants me killed. What do you 
                         expect?
 

                                     GENE
                         I don't blame you. I don't have any 
                         proof. But nothing like this occurs 
                         in a vacuum. You can't be totally 
                         oblivious. You must suspect something. 
                         You're doing things which are making 
                         people angry. People who have been 
                         in power a long time are losing their 
                         jobs. You know them better than me. 
                         How much does it mean to them?  How 
                         far would they go to hang onto it?

               Her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. GENE sees it, 
               hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor. 
               Excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.

                                     GENE
                         There's only one way to find out for 
                         sure. Try to cancel the last speech.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                              (smiling, covering 
                              her inner thought)
                         I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as 
                         my last speech.

                                     GENE
                         It's the last chance they have for 
                         me to kill you. Try to get out of 
                         it. They won't let you. They can't. 
                         Try to change the schedule and you'll 
                         know I'm right. What have you got to 
                         lose? It comes down to who you trust, 
                         them or me? Test them.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I love it when pistolero's talk of 
                         trust.

               GENE, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. He takes 
               the plunge.

                                     GENE
                         This? I've never even fired one.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Indeed.

               ELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging 
               the room into blackness.


                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                              (in the blackness)
                         Franco! Franco.'

               GENE slips out into the hall as the connecting room door 
               flies open. Light from the other room spills in. FRANCO rushes 
               in, pulling a gun.

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - SECURITY TABLE - DAY - 1:22PM

               The HALL OFFICER jumps from his chair and runs into the suite

               INT. TWENTY-FIFTH FLOOR - HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE quickly moves to the Service Elevator and pushes the 
               button.

               INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:23PM

               ELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light 
               coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in 
               his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame.

                                     FRANCO
                         What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?

               She hesitates.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream, 
                         Franco.

               INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1:23PM

               The service elevator opens and GENE rushes out. He hurries 
               down the dim service corridor. Suddenly an arm snakes out of 
               the blackness and grabs him! HUEY steps into the light.

                                     HUEY
                         Well?

                                     GENE
                         I don't know.

                                     HUEY
                         What are you going to do now?


                                     GENE
                         I don't know. I have to get back.

               GENE keeps moving fast.  HUEY limps to keep up

                                     HUEY
                         What are you going to do!?

                                     GENE
                         This is about power and you haven't 
                         got any. There's nothing more you 
                         can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.

               HUEY watches him disappear.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:23PM

               MR. SMITH sees the T.V. TECHNICIAN and REPORTER leaving the 
               bar with their equipment.

                                     OFFICER TRUST (O.S.)
                              (alarmed)
                         Where is he?

               MR. SMITH looks at the man who has appeared behind him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         In the john.

               He looks at his watch.

               1:23.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         Get moving.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You' oughta learn to relax. I told 
                         you I've got it under control.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         It's time. It's time now.

               MR. SMITH scowls and heads for the Men's Room.
 

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:24PM

               A different watch. The minute hand moves to:

               1:24.

               It is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks 
               back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or 
               another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie, 
               puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car.

                                     LYNN
                         Where are we going?

                                     MS. JONES
                         Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at 
                         all.

               She pulls the van out into traffic.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:24PM

               MR. SMITH bursts into the Men's Room. He goes to the stall 
               and lifts his fist to pound on the door.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's 
                         up!

               The stall door opens and GENE comes out, zipping up his pants. 
               He brushes right past MR. SMITH, heads for the door. MR. 
               SMITH reaches out, grabs him.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         You forgot to wash your hands.

               He throws him against the sinks. GENE washes his hands. MR. 
               SMITH leans against the sink next to him In the mirror above 
               the sink, GENE sees the stall door swings open. GUSTINO Is 
               huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. MR. SMITH 
               doesn't notice.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I 
                         know you're not just a regular guy, 
                         see, I know that. Even if you don't 
                         know it yourself. Maybe that's why I 
                         picked you.
 

               GENE steps between MR. SMITH and the open stall door.

                                     GENE
                         I know what I have to do. I'll do 
                         it. Let's go.

               And'they exit the Men's Room. GUSTINO slumps with relief.

               INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:25PM

               Other lights have been turned on. ELEANOR GRANT is fixing 
               her hair in the mirror. FRANCO is cleaning up the broken 
               lamp. There is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it 
               opens, revealing BRENDAN GRANT. The MYSTERY MAN hovers in 
               the background.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Hey, El, how's the head?

               She turns, locks eyes with the MYSTERY MAN.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         Eleanor.

               She nods, turns back to the mirror.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm 
                         thinking of canceling the speech.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         It's an important speech.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         I'd say critical, not that it's any 
                         of my business.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         It's just another speech in a Tower 
                         of Babel so high that Nimrod himself 
                         would be put to shame. Cancel. Make 
                         my apologies.

               In the mirror she takes note of BRENDAN GRANT and the MYSTERY 
               MAN exchange a look.
 

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Excuse me.

                                     MYSTERY MAN
                         I'll trot along. Nice to see you, 
                         Eleanor.

               BRENDAN steps into the room, shuts the door.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         During a campaign every speech is 
                         important. This is free media 
                         exposure. Primetime news coverage 
                         that we couldn't buy.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         What's he doing here?

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Who, him? Just visiting.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT T
                         Hings have changed, Brendan. I thought 
                         you understood that.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         He's my friend. And he did help you 
                         to get elected, after all.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Don't remind me.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (re the broken lamp)
                         What happened here?

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Nothing. I broke a lamp.

               Brendan steps behind Eleanor and puts his arms around her 
               affectionately.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Eleanor, please. I'll put it this 
                         way. This speech or a half-dozen 
                         rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do 
                         you say?


                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Truth is, besides the headache I've 
                         come down with a little lower 
                         intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll 
                         get you some Pepto, you'll make one 
                         of your patented tributes to the 
                         common person, then back to 
                         Sacramento. This is no time to lay 
                         down on the job. I don't care what 
                         the polls say, you can't afford to 
                         relax. Look what happened to Bush. 
                         Tell you what, if you want to blow 
                         off the Sacramento speech, fine. But 
                         do this one and we'll get out of the 
                         smog.

               ELEANOR GRANT looks at him, almost sadly. She steps toward 
               the dressing table to fix her hair

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         All right, I'll do it.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         That's my girl.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         But I want to make some changes. Get 
                         Krista in here right away won't you?

               BRENDAN looks at her for a beat, then snaps his fingers like 
               he just remembered something.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You sent my assistant on an errand.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                              (trying to look 
                              sheepish)
                         I've been a bad boy.

               ANGLE ON ELEANOR

               It was not what she wanted to hear.


               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:26PM

               Mr. Smith pushes Gene toward the escalators.

               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM

               All sorts of MEDIA PEOPLE hover around, CAMPAIGN WORKERS 
               wearing political buttons and REGULAR FOLKS round out the 
               crowd. People are eating, drinking, and talking.

               There are a couple of bars, one at each end of the room. 
               Dessert tables are strategically placed around the room. On 
               the speaker's platform at one end is a podium with some chairs 
               arranged behind it.

               One of the POLITICO'S takes the podium microphone.

                                     POLITICO
                         Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great 
                         pleasure to introduce to you the 
                         esteemed spouse of our Governor. 
                         Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr. 
                         Brendan Grant.

               The crowd applauds warmly.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM

               GENE and MR. SMITH move down the hall, following the signs 
               to the California Ballroom. The entrance to it looms ahead.

               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM

               BRENDAN GRANT at the podium.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Ladies and gentlemen of the press, 
                         campaign volunteers, and those of 
                         you who were looking for any excuse 
                         to take off work for the afternoon...

               Polite laughter.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM

               GENE is pushed up to the doorway where he is met by our 
               friend, the SECURITY MAN with the metal detector. He gives 
               MR. SMITH a nod over GENE's shoulder and sends GENE to join 
               the crowd beyond.


               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:28PM

               VIEW THROUGH CAMERA

               The Video Camera clumsily tracks past the CROWD, and comes 
               tosettle on GENE who is walking into the room, not quite 
               sure where he is going.

               UP ON THE PODIUM:

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         We have with us today the first woman 
                         Governor of our great state...

               GENE is pushing forward into the crowd. He looks back, seems 
               surprised, begins turning, searching for someone as:

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What 
                         can I say about her....that won't 
                         get me in trouble when I get home 
                         tonight.

               Laughter.

               Lose the video camera effect.

               ANGLE ON GENE - 1:28PM

               GENE, in the midst of the crowd, can't locate MR. SMITH. 
               Confusion clouds his face.

               He finds himself near the T.V.TECHNICIAN from the bar. The        
               TECHNICIAN is talking into a walkie-talkie.

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are you 
                         reading me?

               He gets nothing but static. GENE's eyes move to the back of 
               the room.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         She's a woman who loves our great 
                         state.

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Charlie...
                              (gives it up)
                         I can't get shit on this stupid radio.


               GENE looks up to a spotlight booth set up in the back.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         A brilliant legislator.

               GENE sees the GLINT of something. A gun? His eyes widen. Is 
               that MR SMITH there? He looks from the spotlight booth to 
               the stage.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         ...who will soon win her second term 
                         as the greatest Governor California 
                         has ever seen!

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Somebody's going to ave to run down 
                         to the truck. Tell them this radio's 
                         fucked.

               GENE looks away from the stage and locks eyes with OFFICER 
               TRUST. He's at the front of the ballroom to one side of the       
               speaker's platform.

               OFFICER TRUST stares at GENE like a hungry wolf, clutching 
               his gun in his pocket. They both hear:

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         I can't get through. Walkie-Talkies 
                         don't work from here. There's too 
                         much concrete and stuff.

               Realization floods GENE'S eyes. He looks back at Mr. Smith 
               in he booth.

               ANGLE ON MR. SMITH - EXTREME CLOSEUP

               The camera pans along the barrel of the weapon until it comes     
               to Mr. Smith who is settling into firing position.

               ANGLE ON CROWD

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         Ladies and gentlemen...

                                     T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN
                         Nothin's getting out.

               OFFICER TRUST, presses forward, hand in pocket. Gene is his 
               target.


               ANGLE ON PODIUM - 1:29PM

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         I am honored to present to you our 
                         esteemed Governor and my beloved 
                         wife, Eleanor Samara Grant!

               ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

               The crowd erupts in .applause and cheering as ELEANOR GRANT 
               comes from the rear of the auditorium and begins to work her 
               way down the center aisle. She waves and nods to all the 
               lyal supporters who surround her.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Thank you! Thank you all!

               Ballons are released above her onto the center of the floor.

               ANGLE ON WAITER-GUSTINO

               He is pushing a large high cart filled with hundreds of 
               finished plates back towards the kitchen area.

               ANGLE ON GENE - 1:30PM

               GENE looks at Mr. Smith and Officer Trust and the impending       
               disaster. He has to do something...anything...NOW!

               GENE begins frantically clawing his way toward the podium.

                                     GENE
                         Look out! Look out!

               But it is lost in the uproar.

               Fighting to be heard above the noise:

               GENE clawing forward, screaming hopelessly. He pulls the gun 
               out.

               ANGLE ON ELEANOR GRANT

               She spots Gene in the crowd, pushing toward her, gun drawn. 
               Her eyes widen in fear.


               BRENDAN GRANT follows her gaze. His eyes widen in something 
               other than fear.

               GENE aims his gun at the ceiling and fires.

               BAM! BAM!

                                     GENE
                         Look out!

               Pandemonium.  Total chaos. People scattering.

               The Gun in the booth swings from Gene to ELEANOR GRANT.

               Mr. Smith fires, but his target is blocked by a panicked 
               guest who is hit.

               From behind her, FRANCO runs to protect ELEANOR GRANT as 
               more gunfire erupts.

               Mr. Smith's aim is clear and he pulls...BAM!  BAM!

               FRANCO is hit in the center of the back and in the shoulder.  
               He falls onto ELEANOR GRANT and they both fall down hard on 
               the steps. Blood is everywhere.

               ANGLE ON GENE

               He looks over and sees ELEANOR GRANT, beneath FRANCO, looking 
               very dead.

               He careens toward a door.

               ANGLE ON PODIUM

               On the dais, BRENDAN GRANT crawls over to where FRANCO lays, 
               half on top of ELEANOR GRANT. They are both still, eyes 
               closed. BRENDAN looks down at his wife's face, splattered        
               with blood.

                                     BRENDAN GRANT
                         My God, he did it!

               The Governor suddenly and violently gasps for breath.  Her 
               eyes snap open and burn into BRENDAN. She has heard her worst     
               suspicions confirmed.


               BRENDAN'S a great liar, but even he can't hide the shock and 
               fear on his face.

               INT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY

               GENE bursts through a door. He is followed speedily by OFFICER 
               TRUST.

                                     OFFICER TRUST
                         You little son of a bitch.

               His attack is interrupted by a noise from the darkness. The 
               HUGE DISH PLATE CART, fully loaded, comes flying toward them 
               pushed by GUSTINO. The cart smashes into OFFICER TRUST, 
               throwing him against a wall, dishes clatter and smash.

               GENE raises a hand to the darkness and takes off.

               INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY

               The dais. FRANCO takes a shuddering breath. ELEANOR GRANT 
               pulls herself free, leans over him. She rips opens his shirt 
               revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet 
               hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm. His eyes 
               flutter open.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Are you all right, Franco?

                                     FRANCO
                              (painfully)
                         I'd be better if they'd put sleeves 
                         on these damn vests.

               She touches his face, looks over to where her husband stands. 
               Their eyes lock. It's curtains for BRENDAN.

               EXT. HOTEL TAXI STAND - DAY

               The van pulls into a waiting area.

               INT. LOBBY - NEAR SHOESHINE STAND - DAY

               Huey turns and spots a van arriving outside the hotel. He 
               realizes who it could be.


               INT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM

               GENE 'bangs out of a door, comes to a failing and sees:

               MR. SMITH has reached the spiral stairway. He starts down 
               it, two and three steps at a time.

               GENE moves along the railing.

               MR. SMITH is a whole floor below him. He looks up, sees GENE 
               and lifts the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

               GENE pockets the gun climbs the parapet. And jumps!

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:30PM

               GENE lands right on top of MR. SMITH. The walkie-talkie flies 
               over the railing and into the water of the central fountain.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:30PM

                                     MS. JONES
                              (on the walkie talkie)
                         It's time....You read me?  I don't 
                         hear from you I'm going ahead now.

               CHECKS HER WATCH:

               1:30

               INT. THE LOBBY - DAY - 1:31PM

               MR. SMITH and GENE roll down the steps, fighting. MR. SMITH 
               basically beats the crap out of him and gets up to continue 
               on. GENE somehow pulls himself up and tackles MR. SMITH. He 
               gets in a few lucky shots before MR. SMITH overpowers him, 
               beats him again finally .sending him flying into the fountain 
               pool.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:31PM

               MS JONES looks to the back seat at LYNN.

                                     LYNN
                         Why do you keep looking at me?


                                     MS. JONES
                         That's my job. I'm your babysitter.

               As they talk MS. JONES screws a silencer on her gun.

                                     LYNN
                         I'm not a baby.

                                     MS. JONES
                         You're a big girl, huh?

                                     LYNN
                         I'm not a big girl but I'm not a 
                         baby.

               MS JONES turns to face LYNN.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Close your eyes.

                                     LYNN
                         Why?

                                     MS. JONES
                         I've got something for you.

                                     LYNN
                         A surprise?

                                     MS. JONES
                         You ask too many questions. You want 
                         the surprise or not?

               LYNN closes her eyes. MS. JONES makes to do the deed.

               Suddenly, HUEY appears behind her at the windshield.

                                     HUEY
                         Good afternoon, madam. Hello there, 
                         little girl.

               With a crumpled up newspaper he begins vigorously rubbing 
               the window. LYNN's eyes pop open.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey, hey, what are you doing!?


                                     HUEY
                         Just giving you the gift of a clean 
                         windshield. Only cost you a dollar.

                                     MS. JONES
                         I don't want my windshield cleaned.

                                     HUEY
                         You just think you don't want your 
                         windshield cleaned.

                                     MS. JONES
                         No, I know I don't want it cleaned. 
                         Get out of here.

                                     HUEY
                         Don't be like that. Think of me as 
                         the Moses of dirty windshields leading 
                         you through the desert of dead bugs.

               LYNN laughs.

                                     MS. JONES
                         For the last time, I don't want it 
                         cleaned. Now get the hell out of 
                         here!

                                     HUEY
                         It's already done. I've already done 
                         it. You have to pay me now.

                                     MS. JONES
                         I don't have to pay you nothin'.

                                     HUEY
                         You're going to deny me a lousy dollar 
                         after I've sweated like a pig giving 
                         you the gift of a clean windsheild?

                                     MS. JONES
                         Fuckin' A.

                                     HUEY
                         I don't think so.

               He reaches in the passenger's window.


                                     MS. JONES
                         Hey!

                                     HUEY
                         I think this is worth a dollar.

               He snatches the walkie-talkie off the seat.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Goddamnit! Gimme that!

               She lunges across. HUEY dangles the walkie-talkie before 
               her.

                                     HUEY
                         Oh, we'll have to do better than 
                         that.

                                     MS. JONES
                         You worthless piece of shit! Gimme 
                         that!

               She throws open the passenger door, climbs out.

               EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY

               HUEY backs away, taunting her with the walkie-talkie. She is 
               caught between the van and HUEY, trying to keep her gun under 
               wraps.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come 
                         here!

                                     HUEY
                         Gimme a dollar.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Fuck you!

               She loses it, hauls out her cannon.

               BAM!

               HUEY's leg is shot out from under him. He ends up on his 
               back. MS. JONES swoops down on him, trying to grab the walkie-
               talkie..

                                     MS. JONES
                         Gimme that thing!


               HUEY's wounded leg is twisted under him.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY

               Lynn is terrified by the gunfire and looks for someplace to 
               go.

               EXT. THE VAN - DAY

               MS. Jones jumps on the wounded HUEY who is stunned but bravely 
               clutches the Walkie Talkie under him.

                                     MS. JONES
                         Goddammit, give it to me, you 
                         Sunnavabitch!

               She sticks the gun in HUEY's face. He tries to take it away 
               from her, but she's really tough...and mad.  The gun fires 
               wildly, hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing 
               a chain reaction of COLLISIONS on the street.

               INT. THE VAN - DAY

               LYNN tries to open the van door to escape. The van's door 
               flies open. MR. SMITH stands there, gun in hand.-

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Daddy blew it.

               He points the gun. Lynn jumps back in terror and clambers 
               back in the van.  She goes over the seat as he FIRES...

               The back window SHATTERS.

               MR SMITH steps inside the van a step and aims over the seat. 
               This time he won't miss.

               LYNN has nowhere to hide.

               BAM! BAM!

               But it isn't his gun firing. He stands, staring surprised, 
               wide-eyed. He pivots...


               EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY

               ...and stares at GENE, soaking wet, holding the gun. MR. 
               SMITH'S gun slides from his hand.

                                     MR. SMITH
                         Very good...Mr. Watson. I told 
                         them...I could make a killer out of 
                         you.

               He drops to his knees, pauses, then tree-falls onto his face.

               ANGLE ON GENE

               He rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to 
               pick Lynn up.

               ANGLE ON MS JONES AND HUEY

               She has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from HUEY 
               to GENE. She raises her gun and aims at GENE and LYNN inside 
               the van.

               HUEY reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered 
               artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the 
               side of her head. She is knocked aside and out.

                                     HUEY
                         There's nothing like a good wing-
                         tip.

               INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - LATER - 2:26PM

               At HUEY's shoe-shine stand, GENE and HUEY sit in the shoe- 
               shining chairs. They are variously bandaged. LYNN is on GENE'S 
               lap. She clings to him, .her face buried against him.

               They are guarded by COPS.

                                     HUEY
                         What time is it?

               GENE looks at his wrist, gives an ironic smile.

                                     GENE
                         Lost my watch.

               A hub bub catches their attention.


               ANGLE ON LOBBY AREA-BELOW - 2:26PM

               A handcuffed BRENDAN GRANT is lead out by STATE POLICE. PRESS 
               flock around them - shouting questions.

               ELEANOR GRANT watches her husband taken out.

               The PRESS descends on her like ducks on bread crumbs. 
               Questions litter the air like confetti.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Any comment at this time would be 
                         most premature. Please, we'll have 
                         something for you in a couple of 
                         hours. Please...

               ELEANOR GRANT finally makes her way toward GENE. COPS keep 
               the PRESS back.

               INT. BONAVENTURE - SHOESHINE STAND - 2:27PM

               ELEANOR GRANT looks at GENE for a long moment.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I...1 would like to...thank you, 
                         Mister Wat... Gene.

               GENE NODS, SMILES.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         I would also like to apologize.

                                     GENE
                         For what?

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         For not believing you.

                                     GENE
                         Believe me, I don't blame you.
                              (to LYNN)
                         This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.

               LYNN lets go of her father with one of her hands, gives a 
               shy little wave.

               The Governor reaches out, strokes the little girl's hair.


                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         You have a very brave father, Lynn.

               LYNN looks up.

                                     LYNN
                         He's a hero.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Yes, yes he is.

                                     LYNN
                         Dads are like that.

               She goes back to clinging to her father.  Gene looks like he 
               might cry he, loves her so much.

                                     GENE
                         Can we go now?

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Of course. I'll get a car to drive 
                         you.

                                     GENE
                         No, that's... That's OK. We don't 
                         need any help. We'll be just fine. 
                         Won't we, Lynn?

               LYNN nods. ELEANOR GRANT offers her hand to GENE.

                                     ELEANOR GRANT
                         Good luck.

                                     GENE
                         Same to you.

               ELEANOR GRANT walks away. The PRESS renews their assault.

               HUEY and GENE look at each other. Then:

                                     GENE
                         Thanks for the shine.

                                     HUEY
                         Thanks for the tip.


                                     GENE
                              (to LYNN)
                         Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone 
                         call.

               He gets up wearily, carrying his daughter, grabs his 
               briefcase, and heads away. LYNN peeks back over his shoulder 
               at HUEY, shyly waves. HUEY points at her.

                                     HUEY
                         Kisses to you.

               LYNN laughs, comes to life.

                                     LYNN
                         No, kisses to you!

                                     HUEY
                         No, kisses to you.

               INT. BONAVENTURE - LOBBY - DAY - 2:30PM

               Across the lobby, GENE's watch lays on the ground. The crystal 
               is smashed, the hands stopped.

               1:31.

               A shoe steps on the watch, crushing it further. It belongs 
               to the MYSTERY MAN. He stops, checks his perimeters and walks 
               slowly toward the exit.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                                        FADE IN:

    CLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into
    flesh. The ink is needled into the surface of the skin,
    raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the
    precision of ritual.

    The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto
    Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon.
    The image has beauty but retains the violence required to
    saturate flesh with art.

    The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle-
    work.

                             HOLLYWOOD
              Fuck!   Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking-
              fuck!

    PULL BACK to reveal that we're in...


1   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT                                      1

    A place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying
    towels, tea and cigarettes. Dozens of Yakuza look on as
    the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to
    expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos.

    HOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first
    tattoo, a relatively small one on his back.

    He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby.

                            HOLLYWOOD
              Watch it, old man!

    The old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush.       Maybe
    a little harder.

                               HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
              What the fuck?     You're doing it
              wrong.

                            TATTOO ARTIST
              The needle is doing what the
              needle does.

                            HOLLYWOOD
              What's that supposed to mean?

                               TATTOO MASTER
                 The irezumi does not hide the
                 skin, the tattoo reveals the
                 nature of the man and illuminates
                 the four noble professions in the
                 Book of Five Rings: the Warrior,
                 the Artist, the Merchant, and the
                 farmer. If there is a conflict
                 between the needle and the skin,
                 between the mark and the man, then
                 perhaps the path you have chosen
                 is not the path for which you are
                 suited.

                               HOLLYWOOD
                 What did you just say, old man?

    Hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old
    man's jaw.

                               HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
                 I know you didn't just disrespect
                 me, did you? You that fucking
                 stupid? You disrespect me, and
                 I'll tattoo this ceiling with your
                 fucking brains!

    The old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through
    years of service to men like Hollywood.

                                  TATTOO MASTER
                 No disrespect.

    Hollywood smiles.

                               HOLLYWOOD
                 You're lucky. I can't kill you
                 'til you finish this thing. Gimme
                 that mirror! How's it looking?

    Goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus.
    Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror.         He
    whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an
    origami envelope.

                               HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
                 Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck.

                               YAKUZA ONE
                 Hey, boss. This just came for you.

              A letter.

                            HOLLYWOOD
              So open it, dumb ass.

    He opens the origami envelope, then hesitates at what he
    sees.

                             HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
              What?   What is it?

    He pours the contents out into his hand.

                            YAKUZA ONE
              Looks like sand.

    He tastes it.

                            YAKUZA ONE (CONT'D)
              Yup. Sand. Black Sand.

    The tattoo master drops his brush.     It clatters to the
    floor.

                              TATTOO MASTER
              No...

                            HOLLYWOOD
              You know what this is?

    The artist barely nods.

                            HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
              Wanna let us in on the joke?

                            TATTOO MASTER
              Years ago, I watched a man open an
              envelope like that one.

    His eyes pool with fury at the memory.

                            TATTOO MASTER (CONT'D)
              There were many with him and they
              laughed like you laugh now. Then
              it came from the shadows and their
              laughter was drowned in blood.
              You cannot bargain with what is
              coming. You cannot reason with it.
              Because it is not a human being.
              It is a demon sent straight from
              hell that will never stop until
              you are dead.

              What came out of the shadows?

                            TATTOO MASTER
              I cannot say the word.

                             HOLLYWOOD
              What word?

    He pulls open his robe, revealing a hauntingly beautiful
    tattoo of a Shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump
    of scar tissue at the center of his heart.

                            TATTOO ARTIST
              That night, one of their blades
              struck here. I should have died,
              but for an accident of birth. My
              heart is here, on the other side.

    Hollywood peers closer at the dark figure of the demon.

                            HOLLYWOOD
              What the fuck is that?

                            YAKUZA ONE
              Looks like a Ninja, boss.

                            HOLLYWOOD
              A ninja? Are you kidding me?
              That's the word you're afraid to
              say? Ninja?

    As he starts to laugh.

                            HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
              Ninja-Ninja-Ninja!

    His laughter is infectious.

                            HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
              You old fuck! You had me going!
              Ninja. That's some good shit.

    His Lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his
    head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his
    tongue wagging in space.

    Lights shatter around the room.

    Chaos ensues. The panicked screams of the fleeing
    entourage co-mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles
    of Hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are
    eviscerated.

    There's a RUSH of movement, more felt than seen. The
    whistle of swords through the air. Cries and screams.
    Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled.

    STAY on the face of the Tattoo Master, barely visible in
    the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window.
    Frozen. Immobile. As the killing continues around him.

    Then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate
    BREATHING, and a MATCH being struck by Hollywood who
    looks up --

    -- and sees a dark figures standing before him. Everyone
    else is dead. Only he and the Tattoo Master remain. The
    figure regards him with still silence. For perhaps the
    first time in his life, Hollywood is terrified.

                            HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
              Listen... you don't have to do
              this! Whatever you're getting
              paid, I'll triple it! You hear me!
              I'll pay you whatever you want!
              Just name your price!

    Their answer is silence. Hollywood sees his guns nearby.
    With a desperate scream, he THROWS the match in the air
    as he DIVES for his guns, grabbing one in each hand.

    There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed
    hands are tumbling gracefully through the air.

    The blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it
    were barely there, coming out the other side as --

    -- Hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces,
    splattering the artist with blood.

    The match touches the floor and goes out.

    The Tattoo Master does not move, has not moved.    Frozen.

                            TATTOO ARTIST
              But you are real, aren't you?

    After a moment, the ninja emerges into the moonlight, the
    way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the
    dark to inspect its kill.

    The artist doesn't move, but his eyes widen, his heart
    pounding in his ears.

                            TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)
              For fifty-seven-years, I've told

              No one ever believed
              me.

    The ninja walks towards him, his steps soundless. He
    crouches down, his eyes taking in the old man's tattoo.

                            TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)
              But you are real, aren't you?

    There's the shing of a sword being unsheathed.    The
    artist closes his eyes, anticipating death.

    Silence. He waits for the death blow. It does not come.
    He finally forces himself to open his eyes.

    The ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he
    came, leaving death and blood in his wake.

                                                        CUT TO:


2   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                      2

    A roll of toilet paper drops into a cart. PULL BACK to
    REVEAL RAIZO, 20s, slim and sinewy, his expression
    distant, almost haunted. He considers the toothpaste
    options for a moment, then drops in one of those too.
    Moves on to food.

    Turkish Muzak plays in the background, a Beatles song,
    "Helter Skelter" by way of Turkish musicians. Other
    SHOPPERS cruise past in their own private quests.

    Raizo gets quick, easy bachelor food: six eggs, a single
    stick of butter, several handfuls of noodle packages.


3   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT - MOMENTS LATER      3

    Raizo waits while the CHECKER - a pretty young woman -
    tallies up his groceries.

                            CHECKER
              That's a lot of noodles.

              Are you a student? Tourist?   Here
              on business?

    Raizo shakes his head to all three.

                            CHECKER (CONT'D)
              When was the last time someone

    She winks at him.       Very cute.

                               RAIZO
                 I don't think so. Sorry.

    No smile. No emotion in Raizo's face. He pays in cash.
    He picks up the bag and starts away when --

                               CHECKER
                 So if you're not a student, and
                 you're not a tourist, and you're
                 not here to work... what are you
                 doing?

                                 RAIZO
                 Waiting.

                                 CHECKER
                 For what?

                               RAIZO
                 For the wheel to turn.

    And he exits.


4   EXT. ISTANBUL, STREET - DAY                                  4

    Ancient gateway between Asia and Europe. Minarets thrust
    up from the tangled streets into the bright Aegean sky.

    The street is crowded with bicycles, cars and motorcycles
    as Raizo makes his way down a narrow sidewalk.

                               OZUNU (V.O.)

5   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHT               5

    We're in a heavily shadowed room, lit with flickering
    candles as an older man, OZUNU -- hard-edged and
    unforgiving -- talks to his clan.

                               OZUNU
                 ...you must never, ever forget who
                 you are, how you came to be. You
                 are Ozunu. You are a part of me
                 as I am a part of you.

     Beside him is a ten-year-old boy.       His expression has the
     weight of stone.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  This is the truth of your lives
                  and it will remain true after
                  death.

     He pushes the boy forward.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  This is my new son. I have given
                  him the name Raizo. Welcome him
                  as your brother.

     The clan mummers "welcome Raizo", bowing their heads.

     One head remains upright, looking him in the eye.        A girl
     roughly his own age. Her name is Kiriko.

     Raizo turns to his LANDLADY, an older woman who looks up
     at him from the top of the stairwell.

                  We had a heating problem, and I

    He stands on the other side of the door, surveying the
    room for a moment with severe, unforgiving eyes. The
    place is monastic, nothing decorative, or comfortable.

    Then, in a quick series of cuts, he checks all of the
    secret places he hides things.

    A drawer is flipped over and a hidden bottom opens
    revealing weapons. A panel in the oven reveals his chain
    and blade. A hidden compartment in his suitcase exposes
    inky folds of fabric. He sifts through them as we hear-

                            OZUNU (V.O.)
              You should have died.


8   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO - DAY                      8

    Raizo, breathing hard, stands over another young boy that
    he has just defeated in a fight. Both are sweaty, dirty,
    scarred. The other children are lined up in perfect
    rows, watching silently. Most are boys, but a few are
    girls. One of them is KIRIKO, lithe and supple, a
    child's eyes haunted by an adult's sorrows and knowledge.

    Ozunu circles Raizo as he regards his fallen opponent.

                            OZUNU
              On the street. Abandoned by your
              parents. Without a home. Without
              people to care for you. You

    As we TRACK with Ozunu, we see that Raizo's body is
    covered in scars.

              Scars are the calligraphy of
              violence, Raizo. They inscribe
              the story of one's life.

                  Some people see money as the root
                  of all evil, but to me it looks
                  like a fingerprint. Whether we're
                  talking about 19th century Korea,
                  or 21st century Iraq, the game is
                  the same. If you want to
                  understand why certain things are
                  happening, you have to understand
                  the flow of money.

                                MIKA
                  Ozunu. I think. I've been going
                  through some of the original
                  transcripts of the trial of
                  Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor
                  questioned him about a payment of
                  100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki
                  answered that he didn't know what
                  the prosecutor was talking about.
                  The question was never brought up
                  again. But what pinged for me was
                  the amount- the exact same amount
                  rumored to be paid to the Hattori
                  Clan for the assassination of Lord
                  Sanda.

                                MASLOW
                  So you start to wonder, in this
                  ever changing world, if the cost
                  of a man's life has remained
                  constant.

                                MIKA
                  Exactly. I figure these clans are
                  like a thousand years old. They
                  probably don't change a lot.

     She begins flipping through huge reams of bank records.

                                MIKA (CONT'D)
                  I started looking at international
                  wire transfers, targeting banks in
                  the regions of several high-
                  profile assassinations and bingo-

     The proverbial needle in a haystack; a single wire
     transfer circled in red.

                  the assassination $1,555,999.90
                  was transferred from the bank of
                  Shanghai. The exact market value
                  of one hundred pounds of gold.

                                MASLOW

               I thought you might say that so I
               checked how often this particular
               bank transferred that market
               equivalent to a hundred pounds of
               gold in the last three years.

               Let me guess.

               Look, no one's denying the
               historical record, Mika. But the
               whole idea just doesn't fit in
               with a modern world. It's like
               one of those questions on an IQ

               whatever you want if it makes you

               there. They're killing people and
               nobody is doing a damn thing to
               stop them.

      Close on tokens being rammed down the mechanical throat
      of a washing machine. Overhead, the fluorescent lights
      STROBE unevenly, the fixtures old and in need of new

      Raizo steps back as the washer begins to cycle loudly, a
      wheezbox instrument that rattles, gurgles and groans.

      Silently. The fluorescent strobing above them.

      We sense a strange tension between them as we realize
      they are alone in the midnight cleaners. He looks at
      her. She smiles. The uneven strobing on either side of
      the Laundromat casts uneven shadows on her face... almost
      as though she had two faces. One light, one shadow. We
      EXTEND the silence for a long BEAT until he looks down at

      Her eyes REACT as suddenly a blade flashes from beneath
      the sheet, reaching for Raizo's throat.

                  How do you know what the police

                  KGB agent named Aleksei Sabatin.
                  In it, he raises the possibility
                  that several political
                  assassinations were conducted by
                  an ancient but very sophisticated
                  network he calls the Nine Clans.

     He smiles and turns before she flushes a bright shade of

     A teapot begins to sing.

     Raizo pours the boiling water into a plastic bowl of
     noodles. He covers the bowl and waits a moment for the
     soup to cook.

     As he stares, we hear.

17   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - DAY         17

     Several of the younger members of the clan are sitting at
     the table, about to eat.

     Ozunu stands before them. He removes a small blade from
     inside his robe. Places the blade against his palm.

                                OZUNU
                  Hunger and thirst, your bowels and                   *

                  veins, are the body's weaknesses.                    *

     The knife slices down along his palm, opening a split;
     the flesh parts, yet no blood flows.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  Master them, and you master the
                  self.

     He closes his fist.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  This is the power of the Ozunu
                  clan.

     He concentrates, squeezing his hand tightly until he
     opens it revealing that the wound has closed.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  This is the way of the ninja.

     The children look at each other, except for Raizo who
     stares at Ozunu.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  Eat tonight and you work twice as                    *
                  hard tomorrow.

     Ozunu leaves.

     The children look at the soup, their mouths watering.
     All around, the older Ozunu clan members eat noisily.
     One of the children can't resist any longer and begins
     scooping up the noodles. In short order, others do the
     same.

      Willing himself not to be hungry.

      The grown Raizo looks at his soup.    We cannot tell if he
      is going to eat or not.

                                 OZUNU
                   The world feeds on the weak.


18    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHTINGALE        18
      FLOOR - NIGHT

      Young Raizo stands in the central chamber of the
      compound. The floor beneath his bare feet is made of
      thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood
      laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not,
      however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong
      move will make them shift noisily.

      This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor.

                                 OZUNU
                   Suffering exists only because                       *
                   weakness exists.

      Ozunu watches from the far side of the room as Raizo
      takes his first step. Carefully. Graceful as any
      dancer.

      He makes no sound.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   You must hate all weakness. Hate                    *
                   it in others, but most of hate it                   *
                   in yourself.


      He takes another step, and another.    Each soft as a
      falling feather.

      He is a third of the way across the floor - his body
      gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor
      sings beneath him.

      Raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he
      subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending
      foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches.

      Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod.      Slashing
      blows that leave deep cuts.

     Raizo's expression hardly changes. Ozunu returns to his
     place, and Raizo starts walking again, making no noise,
     and leaving no trace of his passage...

     ...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints.


19   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT            19

     The same evening. Most of the children in this place
     sleep on mats in the same room. They are exhausted,
     silent, motionless.

     We FIND Raizo and though he makes no sound, his eyes show
     silent tears of pain, his feet still bleeding and
     bruised.

     Kiriko looks on from her mat for a long, silent BEAT,
     knowing the agony he is in. Then, as if coming to an
     inner decision, she reaches under her mat for a leaf into
     which a thick salve has been folded. She crosses the few
     feet to Raizo's mat and, as he watches in silent agony,
     she puts her finger to her lips, then kneels down --

     -- and begins applying the salve to his feet. Within
     moments, we can see the pain leaving his eyes. Finishing
     quickly, she folds the remaining salve back into the
     leaf, exchanges a quick, furtive glance with Raizo, then
     heads back for her mat.

     He lays there for a BEAT, confused as to whether his
     diminishing pain is a good thing. Then he turns to look
     at Kiriko, but she lays with her back to him, apparently
     asleep.

     He regards her silently for a moment, then rolls over
     himself to sleep as we come around to --

     -- the other side of Kiriko, and see that she is very
     much awake, almost smiling. She closes her eyes.

                                                           CUT TO:

     The apartment is dark as Mika ENTERS and turns on the
     lights. She looks the place over, then goes room to
     room, turning on every light in the place. The practiced
     way she does it makes it clear she does this every night.

     Satisfied she's alone, she goes into the bedroom to
     change.


21   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER           21

     Mika is curled up in a chair and with KGB report.

     She turns a page and sees a photocopied drawing of a very
     intricate floor that we now recognize as the Nightingale
     Floor. She reads the caption beneath it.

                   with what might be one of the
                   oldest of the Nine Clans. He
                   travels with a group of orphans
                   that are being taken from a city
                   devastated by war to the Shido of
                   the Ozunu clan. The people of the
                   surrounding province refer to the
                   Shido as "The Orphanage."


22    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO                             22

      We see Battuta, the 14th century Muslim explorer sitting
      among the original leaders of the Ozunu clan, watching
      two children fight.

                                 SABATIN (V.O.)
                   Battuta describes a ceremonial
                   dinner followed by a display of
                   martial skill. The combatants
                   were children neither beyond the
                   age of ten.

      Battuta masks his revulsion as the battle continues until
      one child beats the other to death. Small fists gleam
      with blood as one boy pummels the other.

                                 SABATIN (CONT'D)
                   His host explains that a man's
                   life must be made meaningless
                   compared to the life of the Clan.
                   Own the meaning of a man's life

      Slowly the light in the bedroom hallway goes OUT.

      She freezes, and the world seems to freeze with her.      She
      doesn't move, doesn't breathe.

      She forces herself to sit slowly up, reaching under her
      bed for a cricket bat. A car drives by outside. Could
      be nothing. Could be everything.

      Despite her fear, she edges toward the door. Slowly
      peers around it. The darkened hall is empty.

      There is a ticking sound, like someone tapping at a
      window. Could be a tree in the wind. Could be something
      else.

      She moves slowly through her apartment.   Every shadow
      could conceal unseen eyes.

      She comes to the end of the hall, where the overhead
      light is out. She flicks the switch on and off.
      Nothing. She reaches carefully toward the light bulb.
      Taps it. The bulb rattles, it's just burned out. She
      breathes a sigh of relief. Then she notices --

      -- that the living room window is open, the blinds gently
      swaying from the wind, tapping against the sash.

      She closes it and locks it. Looks to her desk,
      concerned. Did she leave the window open? Or is
      something going on.

      She goes to her desk, anxious, to check on something.
      She opens a drawer, revealing a box of tampax. Pulls out
      the tampax to reveal a key... a place no guy would think
      to check.

      She unlocks a drawer and takes out an unmarked DVD in a
      slim plastic case. Relieved, she starts to put it
      away...then stops. Is it the same DVD? She moves OS.

      MOMENTS LATER... the TV is switched on, and an image
      begins to play, revealing a time coded security camera,
      recording an urban street corner in Japan. The tape is
      riddled with digital noise and artifacting.

      Then, slowly, the digital noise seems to coalesce, to
      grow shapes. The shadows come to life.

      Then with incredible speed two dark figures start
      battling it out, their blades striking sparks that are
      still descending after they've slipped back into the
      shadows.

      They emerge over and over, brief flashes of clarity like
      the perfect arc of a calligrapher's brush describing the
      wing of a bird. Fight. Retreat. Silence. Shadows.
      Sparks.

      Mika hits the pause button and moves closer to the
      screen, examining the figures.

      One of the figures is wearing a mask, but the face of the
      other combatant is revealed, albeit somewhat obscured by
      the dim light and digital noise.

                 ...who are you?

       She stares at the fierce beauty of his face and touches
       the screen gently.

       CLOSE on a bed of nails; sixteen penny nails arranged in
       perfect rows pointing up, the sharp tips catching the
       light.

       As we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep,
       but this is really the first time we have heard him sound
       like he is straining.

       As we continue to WIDEN, we discover the reason for this:
       he is doing handstand push-ups. On the nails. Over and
       over, with little apparent effort.

       The hard edges and lines of his body catch the light,
       like the tips of the nails, as we HEAR:

       Young Raizo looks up and sees young Kiriko looking at
       him. She smiles. He looks back to his weapon.

       Raizo walks down a street where repair work is being
       done. To keep cars from falling into the hole, they've
       covered the street with big steel plates. As the cars
       and trucks pass over the plates, they make a bump-thump
       sound. Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump. We PUSH IN
       on Raizo under that sound.

     Kiriko is working in the bonsai garden. Raizo watches
     her silently for a moment noticing that she is secretly
     loosening the wires, letting the branches ease back into
     their natural shape.

     He whispers.

                             RAIZO
               You shouldn't do that. It's
               against the rules. If they catch

               They'll put you in the box.

                             KIRIKO
               Yes, they will.

     She finishes releasing the branch.

                             KIRIKO (CONT'D)
               I believe the heart of the tree
               knows which way it needs to grow.

                             RAIZO
               Trees don't have hearts.

                             KIRIKO
               Everything has a heart.

                                  RAIZO
                  I don't.

     There's sadness and bitterness in his eyes. He's closing
     off to the world, becoming what they want. She won't let
     that happen.

                                KIRIKO
                  Really? Let me see.

     He hesitates, then approaches. Kneels down beside her.
     She reaches toward him. He flinches...a sword he can
     handle, but kindness has become something foreign...then
     allows her to undo the top button of his shirt. She
     presses her ear to his chest. Listens.

     Then she gently whispers to it.

                                KIRIKO (CONT'D)
                  Hello....hello, you in there.

     She listens again.

                                KIRIKO (CONT'D)
                  It's saying hello back. And that
                  it's happy to meet me...but it
                  misses you.

     Raizo smiles despite himself.

                                  RAIZO
                  Liar.

                                 KIRIKO
                  Listen to mine, I'm not lying.
                  I'll prove it.

     Again, he hesitates. Then he leans in, and listens to
     her heart. Bump-thump. Bump-thump. She smiles.

                                  KIRIKO (CONT'D)
                  Hello.

      He looks up at her, his ear still to her chest. And for
      the first time, his face softens. Bump-thump. Bump-
      thump. Bump-thump.

23A   BACK TO SCENE                                               23A

      In the present as the traffic bounces past Raizo.        Bump-
      thump. Bump-thump. Bump-thump.

      His eyes saddening with memory, he continues on his way.


24    INT. MIKA'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                   24

      Mika is at her computer doing what she does best:
      intuitively sifting through interconnected threads of
      information.

      Searching through what is known about Ibu-Battuta, she
      discovers information concerning the lost chapters of the
      "Rihla," supposedly destroyed sometime in the 15th
      century.

      She remains immersed until a sound grows louder and
      louder.

      A vacuum cleaner. She checks the time. Very late. She
      looks up and finds two eyes watching her through the
      crack in her open door.

      Startled she gets up while the eyes quickly disappear.

      In the hallway, an older Asian man is pushing the vacuum
      cleaner.

                              MIKA
                Excuse me? Excuse me?

      He shuts it off, turns to her.

                                MIKA (CONT'D)
                Where's Jona?

      He seems not to understand her.

                                MIKA (CONT'D)
                Jona.    The usual cleaner. Jona.

                                ASIAN MAN
                Ahh, Jona.    Jona sick.

                             MIKA
                Oh. Well, tell him I hope he
                feels better

                                   MIKA

                                ASIAN MAN
                  Work so late. Not good for you.

     She smiles sheepishly.

                                   MIKA
                  True...Thanks.


25   EXT. BERLIN STREET - NIGHT.                                  25

     Mika walks down the empty street, the sound of her heels
     slap against the stone buildings.

     The shadows seem to stalk her.

     She hears a faint sound like metal claws against glass.

     She stops and listens trying to see into the dark.

                                MIKA
                  ...is someone there?


26   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                        26

     Raizo is practicing his chain form.

     We begin to hear the sounds of another fight.
                      GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   26.


27   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO - NIGHT                    27

     Raizo, is fighting with TAKESHI, a few years older, in a
     room lit by hundreds of hanging torches. Armed with
     katanas, the boys duck, dodge and weave around the
     burning obstacles as they fight.

     They are both extremely agile, their bodies moving with
     the impossible flexibility of youth.

     Kiriko watches along with the other members of the clan.
     If she feels anything as she watches the fight, we cannot
     tell.

     They perform a vicious series of combinations, then
     Takeshi's sword cracks against Raizo's head, opening a
     huge gash.

     Raizo hits the ground hard, blood speckling the mats.

     Takeshi backs away as Ozunu steps in.

     As blood flows down the side of his face, Raizo looks
     like the young boy that he is. Pain throbs from the
     wound, and he begins to cry.

                             OZUNU
               Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?    You                   *
               think this is pain? You are                           *
               mistaken.                                             *

     He gouges three fingers into the boy's stomach and twists
     something inside of him.

     Raizo screams.

     His screams smear into uncontrollable sobbing.

                             OZUNU (CONT'D)
               That is true pain. You must learn                     *
               to live with it.

     He steps back, leaving Raizo writhing in agony.

                  the night.

     He signals to the rest of the clan and they all begin to
     leave.

     Kiriko is the last to turn away.

                                                          TIME CUT:

     Later.    Night.

     Raizo is still where we left him, a twisted knot of pain,
     his face stained with tears and crusted with snot.

     He is trying to control his breath, at first without
     success. Then slowly, finally, it begins to ease. His
     hand, twisted into a kind of rigor mortis, slowly begins
     to relax, opening like a lotus flower.

                                                          TIME CUT:

     Dawn breaks over the wall, as Ozunu returns to the dojo
     to find Raizo is sitting in a full lotus, completely
     calm, the wound already beginning to heal.

     Ozunu shows a hint of a smile.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  Very good, Raizo. Very good.

                  Last night I'm working late and I
                  get a visit. Guy named Zabranski.
                  Works upstairs for Internal
                  Affairs. Just drops by. In the
                  neighborhood- cup a sugar- how ya

                  working on. Oh, this and that,
                  usual blibbity blab, I tell him.
                  Then he smiles and says-

     Zabranski is leaning against the door jam.

                                  ZABRANSKI
                  ...Very Good.

     His faint smile reminds us of Ozunu.


31   EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY                                    31

                                MASLOW
                  I don't understand what is really
                  going on, but I'm smart enough to
                  recognize a warning when I see
                  one.

                                  MIKA
                  But why?

                                MASLOW
                  Why? It's obvious. If your little
                  fantasy has even slightest chance
                  of being real, then these Nine
                  Clans would have some pretty major
                  juice protecting them.

                                MIKA
                  What are you going to do?

                                MASLOW
                  We are going to tip-toe, very
                  carefully from here on out. You
                  understand? You don't do anything
                  else without checking with me. Got
                  it?

     She nods.

                                MIKA
                  Did you find Sabatin yet?

     Maslow isn't sure he wants to answer her.

                                  MIKA (CONT'D)
                  You did.

                                MASLOW
                  Yeah...he's dead.

                                  MIKA
                  How?

                                  MASLOW
                  Heart attack.

                                MIKA
                  They killed him.

                                MASLOW
                  People die of heart attacks, Mika.

                                MIKA
                  Was he married? Did he have a
                  family?

                                MASLOW
                  God, you are relentless, aren't
                  you.

                                MIKA
                  I know you Ryan, you would have
                  checked.

                                  MASLOW
                  A wife.

                                MIKA
                  Still in Russia?

                  Relocated.

                  Where?

     He pulls a folded piece of paper from his jacket.

                                MASLOW
                  Explain something to me first.
                  Where is this obsession coming
                  from? What started this whole
                  thing?

     She thinks.

     CUT BACK.

     She shrugs.

                               MIKA
                 Like your father said...It's a
                 consequence of consciousness often
                 interpreted as desire.

                               MASLOW
                 Desire for what?

                                  MIKA
                 For the truth.

     He shakes his head, handing her the paper.

                               MIKA (CONT'D)
                 Potsdam. She's in Berlin.

     Mika shoots off as Maslow calls-

                                  MASLOW
                 Mika! Tip-toe!

     She takes several exaggerated tip-toe steps.

                                                               CUT TO:

     A shuriken blade grinds against a whetstone as Raizo
     sharpens the weapon with practiced grace...despite being
     blindfolded.

     Sunlight is held back by vertical blinds.

     When he finishes, he stands, a Rodin sculpted out of
     midnight.

     We realize there are wooden blocks placed around the
     room.

     In his palm, a single shuriken abruptly fans into many
     like a deck of cards.

     Suddenly his arm whips around as the shurikens crack and
     split the thick wooden targets.

     He stands alone, still blindfolded.

     One of the OLDER NINJAS is wrapping Raizo's eyes with a
     sticky gauze, like the tape used to wrap horse's legs.

                                MR. OZUNU
                  For an entire year, you shall live
                  without one of your senses,
                  beginning with the sense you rely
                  on the most: your sight.


34   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO - NIGHT                      34

     Takeshi's sword slides from one position to another as
     Ozunu looks on.

     Raizo, blindfolded, reacts to the sound, matching his
     posture a fraction of a second later.

                                OZUNU
                  A true Shinobi lives in darkness.
                  The night is his weapon.                             *

     Takeshi attacks again. While Raizo eludes or blocks
     several blows, for every two he manages to block, another
     connects.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  You must see with more than your                     *
                  eyes.                                                *

     Raizo gets up, slowly releasing the tension in his jaw.

     He takes his position again, and this time the stance is
     easy, his expression softer. This time, as Takeshi comes
     at him, everything becomes clear.

     The whistle of the blade.

     The zip of the leg sweep against the tatami mat.

     The sound of his robe.

     Combined with Takeshi's unmistakable body odor Raizo has
     everything he needs to dodge, slip and counter.

     His chain strikes, wrapping an ankle, throwing a stunned
     Takeshi to the wall.

     Kiriko tries to hide her smile.

     Ozunu nods in appreciation.

     Raizo nods back, as if he can see without eyes.


35   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT                 35

     Young Raizo, still blindfolded is in bed. Trying to
     sleep, but it's impossible. Takeshi's snoring doesn't
     help.

     He turns slightly towards Kiriko, as her chest rises and
     falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of
     sea-water in a tidal pool. He begins to breathe in sync
     with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him.

     Slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until
     only her breathing, and his, remains. There is the
     slight murmur of their hearts.

     Then she opens her eyes...and smiles at him because he
     cannot see her. But he hears her heart begin to beat
     faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips.

     They listen to each other's breathing growing heavier,
     the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster.

     Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement...tilting
     her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against
     the blanket-

     It's like tectonic plates shifting for Raizo.

     Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump their hearts growing
     louder and louder as they become-


36   EXT. POTSDAM - SABATIN HOME - DAY                            36

     Mika knocks.       The cold war widow opens the door.

                                  MIKA
                  Mrs. Sabatin?

                                  MRS. SABATIN
                  Ja.

                                MIKA
                  I'm with Europol. We spoke on the

                                MRS. SABATIN
                             (stepping aside)
                  Ah, sehr gut. Bitte...please.

     Mika enters.


37   INT. SABATIN HOME - DAY                                      37

     Sabatin and Mika sit across from each other. The house
     has the chill of loneliness. Tea has been set out
     between them.

                                MRS. SABATIN
                  You said you read my husband's
                  report, yes? What did you think?

                                MIKA
                  I found it...illuminating.
                  Especially the references to the
                  Rihla. Your husband quotes
                  passages not found in Battuta's
                  present manuscript.

                                MRS. SABATIN
                  My husband journeyed all over the
                  world researching that report, but
                  when he was home, he never spoke
                  about it. He said it was safer
                  that way.

                                MIKA
                  I understand the report caused
                  some problems for him inside the
                  KGB.

                                MRS. SABATIN
                  The report caused "problems" for
                  Alexei's career the way Moses
                  caused problems for the Pharaoh,
                  you see? Very unpleasant.
                  Terrible people saying terrible
                  things.

     She pours tea, the harsh memories still fresh.

                   After he retired...was asked to
                   retire...we moved, first to
                   Byelorussia and then here to
                   Berlin when the wall came down.
                   He said this will be a good place
                   to grow old together. And it was,
                   for a time.

                                    MIKA
                   What happened?

      She looks off, shakes her head.

                                 MRS. SABATIN
                   About two years ago...two? Yes,
                   after the assassination of Zhukov,
                   the report drew attention. After
                   that, everything was different.


38    FLASHBACK - EXT. SABATIN HOME - DAY                          38

      As Alexei supervises, workmen install locks, put in
      fencing material, hang lights and video cameras on the
      outside of the house.

                                 MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)
                   Alexei hired men to change all the
                   locks, and put in more of them.
                   Locks on the windows, locks on the
                   doors, locks on the locks. He put
                   in cameras and motion sensors and
                   lights...everywhere, lights.

      The lights SNAP on, illuminating the back of the house
      with brilliant klieg lights.

                                 MRS. SABATIN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                   "There can be no shadows," he
                   said. "No shadows."

      CLOSER on Mrs. Sabatin as she looks down at her tea.

                                 MRS. SABATIN
                   I will tell you a true thing, and
                   a hard thing. My husband was a
                   soldier. A member of Russian
                   intelligence. He had seen many
                   terrible things....
                                        (beat)
                   He was not a man to frighten
                   easily.

                                 MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)
                   But from that day on, when the sun
                   went down behind the hills...in
                   his eyes, I saw the fear a child
                   has of the dark.
                                        (beat)
                   Then, one day, a man came to the
                   door.


39    FLASHBACK - INT/EXT. SABATIN HOUSE - DAY                     39

      We are over the shoulder of someone who could be Raizo or
      Takeshi as the door opens revealing Alexei.

      After a moment Alexi invites the man in. A security
      camera watches them enter the house.

                                 MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)
                   They talked in Alexei's study for
                   sometime. Then the young man
                   left.

      Mrs. Sabatin watches the young man leave then hurries
      toward the study door.

                                 MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)
                   It was unlike Alexei not to see
                   him out. I remember being very
                   scared. But when I opened the
                   door, he was just sitting there.
                   For a moment, he didn't even
                   notice me. Then he stood up and
                   kissed me and told me that he
                   loved me very much. He said I
                   should always remember that.

      We see Alexei looking shell-shocked, eyes hollowed, as he
      stands and kisses his wife. His eyes begin to shimmer
      with tears but before he cries, he leaves.

39A   BACK TO SCENE                                               39A

                                 MRS. SABATIN
                   No. Alexei never spoke about it.
                   But two months later, he was dead.

                                 MIKA

40    FLASHBACK - EXT. SABATIN HOUSE - NIGHT                      40

      The lights have come on outside his house. Alexei comes
      out, a gun in hand, shielding his eyes. Searching for
      whatever set off the automatic lights.

      Then, suddenly: darkness.

      And sudden MOVEMENT in the shadows that LUNGES toward
      Alexei.

40A   As Mrs. Sabatin shakes her head, looks away.    Shrugs.    40A

                              MRS. SABATIN
                The lights went out.

      She looks to Mika.   That says it all.   She rises.

                              MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)
                You are the first person who has
                taken my husband's work seriously.
                It would be good to know that he
                did not die without cause. Come
                with me.

      Mika follows her into --

      -- an adjoining room, where Mrs. Sabatin pulls the bottom
      drawer of a bureau out and sets it on the floor. From
      the darkness she removes a metal box.

                              MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)
                He would want you to have this.


41    INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                       41

      Raizo sits alone. Crossed-legged on the floor. Utterly
      still.

      There's an ocean of sound swirling around him.    The
      cacophony of Instanbul evening rush hour.

      Raizo starts to build a dam; auricular sandbags laid one
      by one, walling off the outside world.

      The traffic outside- horns, engines, squealing tires,
      rattling trucks chassis- all fade away.

      People shouting, singing. A couple next door making love.
      A baby wailing. Jackhammers pounding...

      Slowly, the world fades away, until there is only one
      sound. Faint, familiar, but almost too quiet to hear...

     Raizo's heartbeat.

     He listens to it.    Meditates on its simple rhythm...

     Until a sound explodes in the room, it is a sound we
     haven't heard in his apartment-

     A phone.

     He rises slowly as the phone continues to ring.   He
     answers it silently waiting for something-

     The line clicks and goes dead.


42   EXT. ISTANBUL STREET SOUK - DAY                            42

     Raizo walks through the crowded market. Shoppers,
     salesmen and tourists fill the narrow aisles between the
     stalls.

     FIVE CHILDREN- who we see only from the back- run past.
     Shouting laughing. The last one jostles against Raizo as
     he goes by.

     Raizo keeps walking, but he is holding an envelope in his
     hand. He slips it into his pocket.


43   EXT. ISTANBUL STREET - DAY                                 43

     Raizo opens the envelope as he crosses the street.
     There's a square of paper inside, and a photograph.

     On the paper is a street address in Berlin. The
     photograph is a close-up of a woman's face...

     Mika.


44   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  44

     Close on the box. It sits on her desk, calling as
     another box once called to Pandora.

     She opens it.

     Inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the
     style of 1970's archeologists (like those of the dead sea
     scrolls) of the lost chapter of Ibn-Battuta.

     The scrolls contain his 14th century Islamic writing and
     several sketches.

     There is also a very rough map that suggests the location
     of The Orphanage.

     Images of the orphanage, of the children training and
     their ordeals, bloody combat, ritual bindings, beatings
     on the Nightingale floor.

     There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage
     tree of the Nine Clans.

     Also in the box is a single VHS tape.

     She pushes the tape into the player.

     It's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the
     front of the Sabatin house.

     A man walks up to the house and rings's the bell. We
     cannot see his face. Sabatin opens the door. They
     exchange words. Sabatin seems wary but invites the man
     in.

     Mika doesn't understand why this is significant.

     She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man
     exits. She stops, rewinds and plays it again.                   *

     As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his
     face-

     It is Raizo.

     She is startled when someone pounds on the door. It
     seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries
     to open it revealing-

     Maslow and he's not happy.

                                MASLOW (O.S.)
                  You lied to me.

     He pushes into the room and slams the door behind him.

                  What're you --

      He tries to dial it down, succeeds, but only a little.

                   When you were slapping my code all

                   notice the classification code on
                   the cases you were digging

      She knows.

      We SEE men and women in dark suits, their expressions
      deadly serious, tossing through everything he has in the
      place.

45A   BACK TO SCENE                                               45A

                                 MASLOW
                   Right now there are people from
                   internal affairs, CIA, Homeland
                   Security and for all I know the
                   Martian Fucking Military in my
                   office tearing the place apart.

                   I don't know what they're looking
                   for but I think you do.

      She shifts nervously, no poker face.    She turns and leads
      him into her home office.

      With the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer.

      Maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of Sabatin's
      box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence.

                                 MIKA
                   Most of this is from Sabatin.
                   Copies of what I think are the
                   lost chapters of the Rihle. I
                   think it describes the original
                   location of the Ozunu Clan but my
                   14th century Arabic is a little
                   rusty.

                                 MASLOW
                   And this?

      Meaning the DVD.

                                 MIKA
                   That's how it started. I made a
                   mistake, mixed up the case code
                   and they sent me that.

      A moment later the DVD is playing, Raizo and the other
      ninja dancing through the shadows.

                                 MASLOW
                   ...Christ.

                                 MIKA
                   Yeah. I know. I don't understand
                   why they're fighting though. It
                   could be a clan war.

      Maslow starts to put it together.

                                 MASLOW
                   So you requisitioned this by
                   accident. You used my code which
                   is why you didn't want to show me
                   this. Which is also why they're
                   tearing apart my office right now.

                                 MIKA
                   I'm sorry Ryan. You have to know
                   I didn't mean for you to get in
                   trouble...

                  I just thought if this was real,
                  if these clans were killing
                  people, you know, it was our job
                  to try to stop them.

      He eyes her.

                  Isn't that what your dad would do?

                  Okay, that's low.

                                MIKA
                  Look, I know I broke the rules.
                  I'll explain what I did and accept
                  the consequences.

                                MASLOW
                  Very noble of you but I've got the
                  feeling this isn't a slap-on-the
                  wrist kinda consequence. Let me
                  take this and try to make some
                  sense of this shitstorm you
                  started. In the meantime, you
                  will not say anything to anybody.

      Japan, trying to relate the Ibu-Battuta's drawing to it.

      Suddenly she realizes she is not alone;

      Zabranski is leaning against the door jam. He smiles.

                  You have something of a social

                  You had lunch with him on the 13th
                  and again on the 18th.

                  Just routine. The agency cares
                  about its field operatives. We

                  Maslow has a serious case load.
                  That much work can wear on a man.

     It is later. The garage is a gyre of shadows.       Mika
     walks towards her car.

     The fluorescent light flickers and goes out.      She stands

               No way-

                             MASLOW
               Don't fucking argue with me, Mika.
               I trusted you. Now you've got to
               trust me.

                             MIKA
               Ryan, I can't let you lose your
               job because of me-

                             MASLOW
               I'm not talking about my job,
               Mika.

     He hands her a Glock and two spare clips.

                            MASLOW (CONT'D)
               Take this. It's clean, no serial
               number. Untraceable.

                             MIKA
               I've never even fired one of
               these.

                             MASLOW
               (pointing) This is the bad end.
               This is the end you hold. Point,
               shoot, run like hell.

     He also gives her a phone.

                  I know. It's unbelievable. I've
                  investigated, world bank
                  officials, drug cartels, arms
                  dealers, and I've never faced this
                  kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking
                  unbelievable!

     He shakes his head and slips out the door.


52   EXT. MIKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                       52

     Mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment
     building, gets out and starts down the street when she
     sees --

     -- the apartment building and the one next door are dark.
     Candles and flashlights are visible in some of the
     apartment windows, a scattering of neighbors congregating
     outside. Mika approaches a NEIGHBOR.

                                   MIKA
                  Hey....

                                   NEIGHBOR
                  Hi.

                                   MIKA
                  What happened?

                                NEIGHBOR
                  Power's out. Us, the building
                  behind us, that one across the
                  street. Seems like every few
                  months, boom, the lights out. I
                  call, I complain, they
                  listen...nothing gets done. So I
                  sit out here, at least it's cool.

     Mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to
     believe that ninjas are responsible for everything. She
     pulls a tiny LED flashlight out of her bag and starts
     into the building.

                                NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)
                  Watch your step.

                                MIKA
                  You're not the first person to
                  give me that advice today....

     And she continues into --


53   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT           53

     -- where she climbs the steps, each creak adding to the
     possibility of attracting trouble. On the passing
     floors, we hear doors being opened and shut, footsteps,
     the distant murmur of voices. Could be nothing. Could
     be everything. She presses on.


54   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                      54

     She opens the door to her apartment, shining the tiny
     light ahead of her. Shadows chase each other across the
     room as she swings the light one way, then another.
     There seems to be no one else in the place. But as she
     hurries into her home office, we see --

     A shadow move behind her.

     As she packs she begins to hear something, a tapping.
     The same sound she heard before. She pulls the gun from
     her purse. With the flashlight spearing the darkness,
     she goes to her office.

     Again the window is open, the blinds gently blowing
     against the sash.

     She is certain the window had been locked.

     Now every shadow is alive.

     She rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction.
     Her flashlight finds her suitcase. On the top of her
     clothes she sees it: An envelope. Perfectly centered.

     Setting the gun down, she picks up the oragami-folded
     envelope. Opens it with a shaking finger.

     Black sand spills out.

     Terror steals her breath. Behind her, a shadow tilts and
     reveals the eyes of a ninja.

     Before she can even move, a blade flashes from the
     darkness, heading for her neck-
                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Another shadow blocks the blade, knocking Mika over the
     bed.

     The sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the
     combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding
     darkness.

     Her flashlight catches glimpses. Impossibly fast, lethal
     predators trying to kill each other.

     She crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase,
     towards the gun. Another blow arcs for her and is again
     blocked.

     Her hand finds the handle of the gun.         She points into
     the dark, fires.

     The gun flash strobes the room, freezing the two ninjas
     in the blink of a flashbulb.

     They move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying.

     She can feel them fighting very close to her and when she
     finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep-

     Blood erupts.       One shadow falls to the ground.

     The other turns towards her. Her flashlight shakes as
     the ninja reaches up and removes his mask.

     It is Raizo.

     He sees in her eyes that she knows him.

                                  RAIZO
                  You know me?

     She nods.

     He leads her down through the stairwell of the large walk
     up. She follows him step by step.

     Suddenly he pulls her into the corner of a doorway.
     Wrapping the tablecloth around them, they melt into
     darkness.

     Beneath the wrap, he puts his hand over her mouth and
     nose stopping her breath.

     Outside after a long beat a ninja's foot silently glides

     Inside he releases her nose. Before she can finish
     taking a breath he yanks her up and they quickly descend
     the remaining stairs.


56   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                             56

     The dead ninja lies in a pool of blood.

     The shadows come alive and four dark figures emerge, born
     from the black-

     The Hanta Kirra.

     Their leader drifts forward surveying the apartment, his
     dark eyes flashing that we recognize.

     Like snap-focus flashes taking in the myriad signs of the
     fight: the bullets in the wall, footprints, and shattered
     lights. One of the killers uses his sword to trace the
     line of a slashing cut in wall. Braille from the blow
     that Raizo used to cut the ninja.

     He removes his mask and we see it's Takeshi.

                                TAKESHI
                  Raizo.

     Another Ninja leans forward and tastes the air with his
     nose. Eyes closed. Like a dog getting the scent, his
     inhalation a long, low whisper in the silent room.

                                DOG NINJA
                  He's taken the girl.

     Takeshi nods turning to the windows.      He smiles; A hunter
     who knows the hunt is almost over.

                                OZUNU (V.O.)
                  Weakness compels strength.

                                                              CUT TO:

     A figure is running wildly through the thrashing
     branches.


58   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT             58

     Ozunu addresses the clan, his eyes like those of an

     We rush up behind the figure who glances back.     It is
     Kiriko and she screams as we attack-

     The sound of the assault becomes-


62   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                          62

     Mika's car rushing past us.


63   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                             63

     Raizo is silent.    Mika is driving.

                              MIKA
                I'm going to have to make a phone
                call in order to get the
                manuscript.

                               RAIZO
                Not now.   Just drive.

                               MIKA
                Where?

                              RAIZO
                Does not matter. Just get as far
                away from here as fast as you can
                without drawing attention.

                              MIKA
                You think they're following us?

                              RAIZO
                I know they're following us.

     She watches in the mirror for a moment.

                                MIKA
                  I don't see anything back there.

                                RAIZO
                  They have our scent.

                                MIKA
                  Following our scent?    Like dogs?

                                RAIZO
                  No. Like Wolves.

     She swallows.

                                MIKA
                  How do you know so much about
                  them?

                                RAIZO
                  I was one of them.

                                MIKA
                  You flunked out of ninja school or
                  something?

                                  RAIZO
                  ...something.


64   FLASHBACK - INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                           64

     Raizo is dressed in normal clothes his hair starting to
     grow back from the close shave he had in the Orphanage.
     He wears a silk blindfold.

     Ozunu sits in the leather gloom of the stuffed
     upholstery.

                                OZUNU
                  You may remove the blindfold.

     Raizo does so. Looking around at the lights of Osaka, a
     city he has never seen before.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  Your entire life has brought you
                  to this moment. Do not fail
                  yourself. Do not fail your
                  family.

     Raizo nods faintly.

                                MR. OZUNU
                  He is wearing a black and gold
                  watch. Bring it to me.

     Raizo nods again, then opens the door and steps out.


65   INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                              65

     CLOSE ON the fat wrist of a large man as he strides
     across the lobby.

     He turns to his entourage which includes several
     bodyguards and a few arm pieces.

                                 KINGPIN
                  Wait here.   Gotta piss.

                                BODYGUARD
                  Want me to come with you, boss?

                                KINGPIN
                  Why? So you can shake it for me?
                  You some kind of secret faggot?

     He laughs and the arm pieces cluck on cue.

     He heads into the bathroom.


66   INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT                           66

     Kingpin enters there is only one person in the bathroom-

     Raizo washing his hands. His eyes flash in the mirror,
     watching the Kingpin only after he has turned away.

     The enormous man steps into a stall. After a moment he
     begins to piss, moaning slightly as he does.

     Raizo hits the air dryer button.        The sound fills the
     room.

     A thin razor sharp blade flashes from his sleeve.

     The Kingpin continues to enjoy his piss but as we look at
     him we see the door behind him silently swing open,
     revealing Raizo.

     Raizo stares at the back of the man's head. He can
     almost see his jugular beating beneath the thick folds
     of his neck-

     But something prevents him from striking.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

     The dryer stops, the sound of the piss dribbling when the
     Kingpin suddenly looks back over his shoulder-

                                KINGPIN
                  The fuck-?

     Raizo strikes but the kingpin is able to deflect the blow
     which sinks into his enormous body.

     He laughs.

                                KINGPIN (CONT'D)
                  That kinda tickled...

     He smashes a fist into Raizo that slams him backwards.

                                KINGPIN (CONT'D)
                  Gonna take more than a knitting
                  needle to fuck me up, boy.

     Raizo attacks and it is immediately apparent that this is
     not going to be easy.

     Several ferocious blows that would have broken the neck
     of a smaller man, only seem to make the Kingpin madder.

     Soon both are covered in blood, and gore.

     But it is not until Raizo slams the man's head against
     the lip of the urinal-

     The first time a font blood splashing up--

     The second time the porcelain shatters as the Kingpin's
     head opens, spilling black blood across the floor.


67   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                          67

     It is raining.

     Raizo, still wearing his bloody clothes, climbs up onto
     the roof, his clothes spattered with gore.

     He waits as the shadows around him come to life: Ozunu,
     Takeshi, and several other clan members surround him.
     All but Ozunu wear their masks.

     Raizo extends his hand, revealing the black and gold
     watch, smeared with fresh blood. He offers it to Mr.
     Ozunu.

                                OZUNU
                  Keep it. It will remind you that
                  every minute of your life is a
                  gift that I have given you.

     Ozunu smiles.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  You have made me proud tonight,
                  Raizo. There are some who
                  believed you would fail, but I
                  knew you would not.

     His eyes narrow.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  You have a strength inside you
                  Raizo. You must use that
                  strength, now to show me that you
                  are truly Ozunu.

     Several of the other ninjas step back. Revealing
     Takeshi. He pushes a small hooded figure forward.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  Weakness compels strength.
                  Betrayal begets blood.

     Takeshi yanks the hood off revealing a young girl.         She
     is bloody, bound and gagged and for a flash-

     Raizo sees her as Kiriko.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  A daughter that turned her back on
                  her family. She tried to run.
                  Takeshi hunted her down.

     He unsheathes his blade, offering the hilt to Raizo.

                                OZUNU (CONT'D)
                  It is the law of the Nine Clans.

     Raizo looks at the girl, her tears lost in the rain.

     We cannot tell if Raizo is crying as he takes the blade-

     He CRIES OUT, the light of madness in his eyes.

     He STRIKES, lashing out with the fury of a wild animal,
     at Ozunu --

     -- who bends back with impossible grace.       But not far
     enough.

     The point of Raizo's sword slashes across his face,
     opening an ugly wound that spills blood over his eye and
     mouth...

     He hasn't tasted his own blood in years, and the anger
     boils up in his eyes.

                              OZUNU (CONT'D)
               Kill him!

     Raizo meets their attack. Throwing himself into the fray
     as only a man who is no longer interested in living can.

     But the ninjas are everywhere. They hurl shuriken at him
     by the handful, a storm of jagged steel racing for
     Raizo's flesh.

     Raizo blocks some of the shuriken, misses many more. The
     shuriken strike muscles, tendons, flesh. He SWINGS
     around, still trying to attack, there are too many of
     them.

     He stumbles back towards the edge of the roof as Takeshi
     SWINGS what he believes will be the death blow as --

     -- Raizo half-falls, half-leaps backward, falling from
     the rooftop, tumbling through space, until he --

     -- Splashes into the canal below-

     Bubbles dancing between the ribbons of blood.


68   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                          68

     Mika speeds along the autobahn.

               Okay, if you're not going to say
               anything, do you mind if I talk?
               When I get nervous, it helps if I
               talk.

     He says nothing.

               My name is Mika by the way.

                  Yeah, well usually if someone
                  introduces themselves it is a
                  convention that the other person
                  does likewise.

     He considers her.

                                RAIZO
                  Raizo...is the name I was given.

                                MIKA
                  So, you were an orphan?

     His head nods slightly.

                  Interesting nature verses nurture

     He cocks an eyebrow.

                                MIKA (CONT'D)
                  If it's okay with you, I'll try to
                  fill in some of the blanks. You
                  must have been taken by the Ozunu
                  clan, trained to be an assassin,
                  but something happened and you
                  decided to opt out of the program.
                  I don't imagine this went over so
                  well and since they're after me
                  for just peeking through the
                  keyhole, they must be after you in
                  a major way. But you are also
                  after them or you wouldn't have
                  bothered going to Sabatin. Which
                  I figure means you're searching
                  for the location of The Orphanage
                  because that's obviously the only
                  information Battatu's book would
                  have that you wouldn't already
                  know.

     He looks at her impressed.

                                MIKA (CONT'D)
                  Yeah, I got some moves too. I'm
                  pretty lethal with the research
                  thing.

     He almost smiles.

                             MIKA (CONT'D)
               But here's a question I can't
               answer: since you didn't know I
               went to Sabatin's, why did you
               save me?

                             RAIZO
               Ninja only kill two kinds of
               people. The first kind has power
               and money. The other kind is
               trying to stop them.

     He nods, noticing shops out beyond the exit.

                                RAIZO (CONT'D)
               Exit here.

                                                             CUT TO:


69   EXT. SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT                                  69

     The shops are all closed, Mika's car crawls to a stop in
     the empty parking lot.


70   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                            70

     Raizo looks her over.

                              MIKA
               I understand retail therapy as
               well as any girl but I think it's
               a little late.

                             RAIZO
               You are a size 36?

                             MIKA
               What? No! Size 34...`cept certain
               times of the month.

     He starts to leave then stops-

                             RAIZO
               If you leave while I am gone they
               will catch you and kill you.

     He looks her in the eye.

                             RAIZO (CONT'D)
               Do you understand that?

     She nods. He opens his door and slips out.

     She watches as he heads for the doors. He passes into
     the shadow of the building and disappears.

     She digs into her bag for the phone Maslow gave her.

     She TEXTS: 911. But situ stable. Guardian angel all in
     black. Need Battuta book soon. Will call. M

     She hits send. Looks out to the darkness surrounding
     her. After a moment one of the shadows comes to life.
     The door opens and Raizo gets in, his arm full of
     clothes.

                                RAIZO (CONT'D)
                  We need a hotel.


71   EXT. HIGHWAY MOTEL - NIGHT                                      71

     The car is parked around several others.


72   INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT                        72

     Raizo goes into the bathroom, and turns on the shower.

                                RAIZO
                  Get undressed. Shower. Do not
                  use the hotel soap. Or any towel.
                  Do you smoke?

                                MIKA
                  No.

     He nods.

                                RAIZO
                  Put your clothes in here.

     He pulls the garbage bag from the wastepaper basket.
     Then leaves as she begins getting undressed.


73   EXT. HIGHWAY MOTEL - NIGHT                                      73

     Outside the hotel, Raizo finds a pine tree.       He cuts
     several branches from it.


74   INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT                        74

     Back in the room, he enters the bathroom.        She is still
     in the shower.

                                   MIKA
                  Hey-

                                   RAIZO
                  What?

                                MIKA
                  Don't you know how to knock?

                                RAIZO
                  I'm trying to save your life.

                                   MIKA
                  ...okay right.

     He hands her the tree branch.

                                RAIZO
                  Dry yourself with this.

     He starts taking off his clothes. He does it quickly
     without any sense of awkwardness; the world where he came
     from makes little distinction between male and female.
     She's not from the same world, keeping herself as covered
     as possible with a tree branch.

     He jumps in the shower while she tries to dry herself
     off.

                                MIKA
                  ...I'm just a researcher. I'm
                  really not equipped to deal with
                  this...

     He steps out and quickly wipes the dripping water off his
     body with the branch.

                                   RAIZO
                  Get dressed.

     In the bedroom, Raizo is dressed in new clothes. He
     lights a cigarette as Mika come out struggling with the
     tightness of her new jeans.

                                MIKA
                  These are a little tight.

                                   RAIZO
                  You said 34.

                                 MIKA
                  European sizes...run a little
                  small I guess.

      Raizo takes the cigarette and begins waving it all around
      her.

                                 MIKA (CONT'D)
                   This is for my "scent"?

      He nods.

                                 RAIZO
                   Let's go.


75    EXT. HIGHWAY MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT                       75

      CLOSE as he picks the lock of a different car trunk.

                                 MIKA
                   Wow. They teach you that at ninja
                   school?

                                 RAIZO
                   Most locks are not worth the metal
                   they're made of.

      The trunk pops open. Raizo tosses their bag of clothes
      under the lid of the tire compartment. Then closes the
      door.

      He leads her down the parking lot sizing up the cars,
      until he finds one he likes.

                                 MIKA
                   You're going to steal a car?

                                 RAIZO
                   Just borrow it.

      The door opens.

                                 RAIZO (CONT'D)
                   Get in.

      She sighs.

                                 MIKA
                   In for a penny, in for a pounding.


75A   INT. CAR - NIGHT                                            75A

      Raizo takes out a small electrical device. He aims it at
      the dash and hits a button. The device finds the right
      frequency to start the car.

      She is impressed.

                  Trouble? You miss jury duty
                  you're in trouble. You're in some

                  Your guardian angel? Is it him?

     Maslow waits, the red-tip of his cigarette glowing in the

     Mika is leading.

                   No!

      Kiriko is panting, covered in sweat and blood, standing

                   All failure must be sown into the
                   flesh.

      Kiriko is handed a razor sharp blade.

      Takeshi prepares for the blow, but--

      Kiriko drops the blade.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   What?

      He marches up to her.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   You know the law!

      Her silence remains defiant, while he boils with
      suppressed rage, picking up the blade.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   You will wear this disgrace for
                   the rest of your life!

      He slashes her, slicing across her face.

79    FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT               79

      Raizo wakes up.

      There's a commotion on the other side of the shoji
      screens that comprise the inner wall of the dorm.
      Silhouettes limned against the paper.

      Raizo moves to the screens. Pulls them a half inch aside
      as the other children watch...

      Through the tiny gap, he sees ninjas dragging Kiriko down
      the hall. Gagged, arms twisted with shiburi, blood
      streaking her pale and terrified face.

     Raizo is chained to the walls of a vault. Spread-eagled,
     double-locked, and lit from all sides so there are no
     shadows anywhere in the room.

     Raizo's head sags.   Eyes closed.

     Cameras stare at him.


81   INT. SAFE-HOUSE GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      81

     Classic Berlin aesthetic. A modern office shoe-horned
     into an abandoned building: cubicles, computers and Aeron
     chairs amidst crumbling walls.

     Maslow's team are hanging out there, thirty agents, a
     fairly competent and well-armed bunch. Maslow is inside
     the control room which is like a small construction
     trailer. Several different monitors have images of
     Raizo.

                             SECURITY GOON
               Prisoner is secure sir.

     For a moment it appears that Raizo looks up as Maslow
     looks at him, as if somehow Raizo could see through the
     lens watching him. Then his head drops again.

                              MASLOW
               Right.

     He scans the different monitors.

                             MASLOW (CONT'D)
               Something's wrong with the
               infrared cam.

                             SECURITY GOON
               No sir, we checked it.

                             MASLOW
               Then why isn't he showing up?

                             SECURITY GOON
               We think he's able to lower the
               temperature of his body to remain
               neutral.

                             MASLOW
               Or maybe he's just cold-blooded.

                              SECURITY GOON #2

     The goon struggles to stop Mika as she storms inside.

                                MIKA
                  Ryan, you know this is wrong!   It
                  can't be legal! What is this
                  place? Your own private
                  Guantanamo?

                                MASLOW
                  It's an old GDR safehouse.
                  Jamison wants this off the grid.

                                MIKA
                  Ryan you're making a huge mistake!

                                MASLOW
                  I don't think so. We got reports
                  from Washington, London, Osaka all
                  tagging your boy. Only problem we
                  have is where to extradite him
                  first.

                                MIKA
                  So two weeks ago, there's no such
                  thing as a ninja and now every
                  city in the world has a warrant
                  for one?

                                MASLOW
                  We must respect the jurisprudence
                  of the regional government and
                  corresponding law enforcement
                  agencies.

                                MIKA
                  He's not the enemy.

                                MASLOW
                  No? You ever heard of Stockholm
                  Syndrome I'm getting the feeling
                  I'm looking at a pretty serious
                  case of it.

                                   MIKA
                  I'm not crazy.     This is!

               He's a killer, Mika. Weren't you
               the one telling me it was our job
               to stop him.

                             MIKA

     She wheels on him to let him have it.

               Damn it, Ryan, I --

     -- but he holds a finger to his lips, indicating be
     quiet.

                             MASLOW
               Listen to me, we don't have much
               time. Look, I don't know what
               you've stumbled into, but somebody
               is pulling some major strings
               inside.

                             MIKA
               They want him dead. He's been
               fighting them for years.

                                MASLOW
               I believe you.
                                  (softer)
               I believe you. I've been in this
               business too long not to smell a
               set-up. But we have to be careful
               how we handle this. And I can't

     Raizo remains motionless, his eyes open when he hears
     someone coming.

                                RAIZO (V.O.)
                  You shouldn't do that they'll

                                RAIZO (V.O.)
                  They'll put you in the box.

                  Yes. They will.

     It is the middle of the night. Raizo lies on a floor
     mat, unable to sleep. He looks over at Kiriko's empty
     mat. Quietly he gets up and makes his way outside.

     He moves to an upright bamboo box about the size of a
     coffin. Looking at --

     -- Kiriko, in the box. Dehydration has left Kiriko with
     barely the strength to breathe. Her lips are swollen and
     cracked, she sags against the tight walls of the box.

     He pulls a bamboo straw from his dark robe, then fills
     his mouth with water from a flask.

     Sticking the straw through the bamboo poles near her
     lips, he feeds her drop by drop, and in this way,
     separated by a cage they share a kind of kiss.

     Her eyes part, ever so slightly, and she manages a smile.

                                 RAIZO
                  I told you.   I tried to warn you.

     Mika is standing behind the bars which slide open.

     She has a bottle of water, she looks at the two armed
     guards following her.

                  Sorry ma'am. Maslow okayed the
                  water. That's it.

     They stand near the door as Mika crosses to Raizo.

                  Hi...you looked thirsty.

                                MASLOW
                  They're not here now.

                                MIKA
                  They'll be here soon.

                                  MASLOW
                  How soon-


88   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - VAULT - NIGHT                               88

     Raizo looks up.       His eyes narrow: they're here.


89   INT. SAFE-HOUSE GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                          89

     The lights go out.

     Mika's eyes dart into the pitch, red emergency lights
     suddenly glowing ominously.

                                  MIKA
                  Raizo--

     Maslow spins as she sprints for the stairs.

                                  MASLOW
                  Mika!

     Maslow draws his firearm and hisses at one of the Special
     Ops.

                   Go with her! Secure the prisoner!

      Instantly, tiny LED flashlights and laser targeting
      systems light up on automatic weapons. Night vision
      goggles go up. Rather than panicking, the police are
      instantly in stealth-mode, communicating with quick,
      urgent hand gestures.

      A handful of men splinter off for the vault while the
      rest separate into teams with practiced precision, moving
      through the safe-house, ready for whatever comes.


89A   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - VAULT - NIGHT                              89A

      Mika charges into the holding area, the detail of men
      right at her heels.

                                 EUROPOL WATER GUARD
                   Hold your fire--

      Raizo's guards release their aim.

                   We got some guys in pajamas comin'

      One of them lifts a shotgun.

                                 EUROPOL #2
                   Huh huh. I got something they can

                   I don't have time for this shit.
                   We have to move the prisoner.

      In the back of his cell, Raizo's head lifts at the sound
      of Mika's voice.

                   No ma'am. Those aren't our orders.

      Raizo calls from behind the reinforced door.

                                 RAIZO
                   You've got to get out of here!

      She calls to his cell.

                   Not without you.

      Raizo's voice hangs in the gloom.

      One of the teams edges through the decay of the
      dilapidated industrial cavern.

      Straining through the eyepiece of his goggles one of them
      mutters.

                                 EUROPOL AGENT 2
                   Don't see shit--

      Ahead the point man motions and the men take up defensive
      positions.

      The point man creeps forward, a flicker of heat
      fluttering in his IR-Optic.

                                 POINT MAN
                   Is that..?

      Through the darkness we see that his infrared is actually
      picking up the slow exhale of a ninja poised like a cobra
      inches away just above him.

      His blades flash--

      And the detail of men recoil as their infrared sensors
      light up, the point man cleft open in hot volcanic gore.

      A cloud of shuriken spit out of the darkness and punch
      into necks, faces, eyes. Ten of them fall like wheat
      before a scythe. The rest fire hitting nothing.

     The screams of dying men and gunfire shudder down the
     gullet of the old concrete building.

                               MIKA
               Fuck me...

     She watches as the men position themselves, pressing into
     the black of the corridor. Thumbs flick safeties to hot.

     A shriek pierces the silence, one of the agents suddenly
     jerked from his feet like a puppet on a string.

     They watch in IR as the agent falls to the ground in
     several pieces.

                               EUROPOL #2
               What the fu--

     #2's exclamation gets caught in the oozing slit that
     opens in his throat.

     The man guarding Raizo's cell door screams.

                             EUROPOL GUARD
               They're not showing up on IR!

     He clicks his flashlight the beam glinting against a hail
     of shuriken that pound into him, wounds flowering in
     ribbons of red.

     Mika watches as he lands wetly at her feet.

     More screams and gunfire shake the shock from her.

     She dives for the guard, frantic fingers clawing at the
     key-chain clipped to his belt.

     The remaining Europol Agents cluster together,
     flashlights strobing spastically, while Mika slams
     through Raizo's cell door.

     She instantly goes to work on his leg irons.

                             MIKA
               Come on--come on--

     Raizo's eyes narrow, the last of the Europol Agents
     butchered by shadows.

                               RAIZO

      He can feel the rush of darkness.

                                   MIKA
                   Got it!

      The leg irons click open and Raizo springs forward the
      chain of his handcuffs catching a falling blade. He
      twists and the ring of metal on metal is followed by the
      dry snap of bone as Raizo breaks the ninja's neck.

      She releases his handcuffs and they move quickly through
      the glistening remains of the bodies, Raizo shielding her
      from the darkness.


90A   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - SUBLEVEL - NIGHT                           90A

      The two sprint from a stairwell into a concourse, Raizo
      stopping suddenly, sensing the presence of the Hanta-
      Kirra.

      He pushes her toward another set of stairs.

                                 RAIZO
                   Go. Find Maslow.

      He turns to facing the dark.

                   Go quick.

      She lurches up the stairs as the Hanta-Kirra descend on
      him like a murder of crows.


90B   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                          90B

      Mika flies up the stairs taking the steps two at a time
      rounding the next flight--

      A beam of light flashing weapons rattling suddenly
      trained on her.

                                   MASLOW
                   Mika!

      Her stomach finds its way into her throat.

                   Jesus Ryan--

      Maslow rushes down to her, another agent scanning the
      stairs above them.

                                 MASLOW
                   I thought you were--

      Mika's eyes widen as the agent on the flight above them
      is ripped into the air replaced by a squall of red.

      Maslow whirls as a blade suddenly pierces his side--

      But before it can continue its deadly cut, Maslow catches
      it in a bloody fist and fires into the shadows.

      One of the Hanta-Kirra falls tumbling past them down the
      stairs.

      Maslow grunts as he rips the chain blade from his side.

                                  MIKA
                   Are you ok?

      He nods, a bit woozy.

                   I hope that wasn't my liver. Gonna

     Raizo meets the Hanta-Kirra in the air. Vaults from one
     wall and door to another, spinning in and out of view as
     he moves through the shadows.

     The ninjas move with him, matching his speed and ferocity
     and ability to disappear within the darkness.

     Swords clash against chains and sword and walls.      Sparks
     fly and blood falls.

     This is the first time we've seen Raizo turned loose.
     But it's three on one...and Takeshi isn't a pushover.

     Mika and Maslow slam through the exit into--


92   INT. GARAGE - NIGHT                                        92

     voice crack.

     He opens the door retracing their steps into the dark.

     Mika suddenly very alone manages a slow nervous pirouette
     in the crypt-like garage, before skittering for Maslow's
     sedan.

     She slides in pulling the door shut behind her as quietly
     as she can--

     And waits.

     Maslow moves cautiously through the folds of midnight.
     He hears the fighting before he can see it.

     Raizo blocks a sword-thrust from Takeshi. Dodges around
     a hail of shuriken. Uses his chain to drive another
     Ninja back.

     Takeshi rips free his left arm. Draws a short, angled
     blade and brings it slashing down at Raizo's neck...

     Raizo blocks the knife with his elbow, twists, throws
     Takeshi twenty feet through the air. He recovers mid-
     flight like a cat and regains his balance.

     From the darkness a ninja fires a dozen shuriken at him,
     and at least three of the spinning blades find their
     mark.

     Raizo grunts at the impact, but vaults up and over a
     counter and LEAPS through a window, crashing out to -


94   INT. GARAGE - NIGHT                                        94

     A figure darts in her periphery and her head whips around
     craning all directions.

                  Hurry the fuck up!

     She twists the ignition and as the motor turns over--

     The car's headlights explode, shattered by projectiles
     that seem to materialize from the void.

     Mika screams throwing the car into gear--

     Peeling out toward the down ramp.

     The car fishtails down level after level through the
     oscillating light/dark of the dimly lit exit ramp.

     Her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up
     ahead--

     A shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a
     spider.

     She ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a
     squall of stars.

     The sedan rebounds into the light. Its hood and
     windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a Great
     White.

     Mika cranks the wheel tearing around a dark bend as--

     Toom! Something lands on the roof of the car.

     Above her she sees the distinct tips of the tiger claws
     that have punctured the metal exterior of the car just as-
     -

     She passes under a light--

     Revealing a crouching ninja staring right at her, through
     the sun roof.

     His blade whips from its sheath but before he can strike--

     She jams the barrel of the Glock between the two tips of
     one set of claws, right where his foot should be--

     And fires.

     A scream is followed by a gout of blood that washes over
     the sunroof--

     The ninja's body tumbling off the back of the car.

     Maslow's gnarled sedan bottoms out in a starburst of
     sparks as it corners into traffic.

     Mika breathing heavy digs into her bag for her cell
     phone.

     The lights are still dead. Maslow is with a team of

                                  MIKA
                  Where's Raizo

                                 MASLOW
                  He took off.   We think they went
                  after him.

     He looks into the surrounding shadows unsure.


96   EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT                                         96

     Raizo parkours across the roofs, the Hanta Kirra close
     behind.

     Shuriken sizzle past; some missing, some lashing open
     whip cuts across his flesh.


97   EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT                        97

     Raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side. Drops them to
     the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much
     tossed change. He looks up at winged victory silhouetted
     against the moonlight.

     And suddenly the ninja are on him.

     Raizo blocks and parries. Counterattacks with a reverse
     cut - and throws himself sideways as a truck comes
     roaring down at him.

     The truck fills the screen with lights and horns and
     three tons of death.

     Raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the Scarred Ninja
     to leap the other way, and as he turns --

     -- Raizo comes down on him, slashing his shoulder.


98   EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS           98

     The fight is now two one against one, and one of them is
     Takeshi. Their swords crash back and forth, sending
     sparks flying.

     Raizo is tired, already wounded by the shuriken...

     With a cry, he hurls a second Ninja back and spins to
     face Takeshi...

     Too late. Takeshi's blade gets under his guard.       Opens
     up Raizo's side.

     His sword is ripped free from his hand, rebounds off a
     speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet
     away.

     Raizo stumbles backward. Life's blood dripping down and
     splattering on the concrete.

     Takeshi raises his sword high.       Smiles.

                                TAKESHI
                  This is the end for you, brother.

     Mika's car slashes across the width of the street
     screeching to a stop next to Raizo. The door snaps open.

                                 MIKA
                  Raizo!

     Raizo gets into the car. Collapses into the seat, arms
     wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side. She
     peels away before the others can stop her.

     Mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast
     as she can. Eager to get more miles between them and the
     ninjas.

     Raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump.        His
     shirt is drenched with his own blood.

                                MIKA (CONT'D)
                  What were you doing in the
                  street?!

                                RAIZO
                  ...waiting for you...

                                MIKA
                  You have to go to a hospital.

                               RAIZO
                  No. Not a hospital.     Another
                  place.

     The car speeds into the night.


99   EXT. HERBALIST - NIGHT                                          99

     The sort of store where the owner lives above the shop.
     Mika pounds on the door as a LIGHT comes on in the floor
     above. A moment later, the door opens.

                                 HERBALIST
                  What is it?   What --

     He steps out of the way as Mika helps Raizo in, bloody
     and half-dead.

100   INT. HERBALIST - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                     100

      Herbalist places herbs into a hand-grinder as Raizo
      staggers through the rows of bowls, grabbing what he
      needs and handing it to her.

                              RAIZO
                ...dong-xia leaves...three of the
                lo-chan...dragon root...

                              HERBALIST
                You should not mix these.    Very
                dangerous.

      Raizo ignores him. Gives her some more dried bits and
      pieces. The herbalist shakes his head.

                              HERBALIST (CONT'D)
                If you are in pain...if you wish
                to die...there are other ways,
                this will be agony --

                              RAIZO
                No...it will save me....

                              HERBALIST
                It will?  You're sure?
                                     (beat)
                Let me write this down.

      He goes to find a pen and paper as Mika grinds away.

                                 RAIZO
                Hot water.

      She goes to a tea kettle, pours water into the bowl.   He
      reaches for it, and nearly collapses.

      She helps him raise the cup to his lips. Tilts it and
      watches him drink. Takes the empty cup away from him.

      Raizo shudders as the drugs course through him.

                              RAIZO (CONT'D)
                I have to sleep now...a day at
                least.

      His eyelids flutter.    She's holding him up now - muscles
      already loosening.

                                 MIKA
                A day?!?     What should I do?

                              RAIZO

      He slumps over the counter like a child dropping into
      deepest sleep as --

      -- the herbalist comes back, pen and paper in hand. He
      pauses as he sees Mika standing over Raizo. She looks
      from him to Raizo and back again, then:

                                 MIKA
                   I'll have him to go.

101   EXT. AUTOBAHN - NIGHT                                         101

      Mika is the proverbial bat outta hell.

      Her phone is at her ear.

      INTERCUT WITH:


102   INT. SAFE-HOUSE - NIGHT                                       102

      The lights are back on but the place is trashed.

                                 MASLOW
                   Mika, where are you?

                                  MIKA
                   Moving.   He told me to keep
                   moving.

                                 MASLOW
                   He's still alive?

      She glances at his slumped body.

                                 MIKA
                   After a fashion.

                                 MASLOW
                   Let us bring you in.

                                    MIKA
                   Not this time.

                                 MASLOW
                   Mika, the situation's a little
                   different. Jurisprudence goes out
                   the fucking window when my men get
                   attacked.

      He takes a breath.

                                MASLOW
                   ...negative. They got to my
                   office. Everything's gone.

      The news crushes her.

                                 MASLOW (CONT'D)
                   Mika, it's gonna be all right.
                   We'll find them.

                                 MASLOW
                   We'll keep your promise. They're
                   too many people involved now.
                   It's just a matter of time.

                                 MIKA
                   I don't think we have much time...

                                 MASLOW
                   Just tell me where you are.

      She hangs up.

                                 MASLOW (CONT'D)
                   Mika? Mika? Dammit.

      The car is parked outside the same hotel that he took her
      too.

      She steps out of the shower and dries herself with an
      evergreen branch.


105   INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             105

      In the bedroom, Raizo is sprawled out on the bed.

      She is wearing new clothes. She takes a drag on a
      cigarette then passes the smoke over her body.

                   sure this doesn't matter, but I'm
                   going to say it anyway.

      She looks at him.

                                 MIKA (CONT'D)
                   I'm a forensic researcher, okay?
                   That's like a fancy way of saying
                   I'm a librarian. By myself I
                   can't do anything to help you.

      She opens her fist; inside is the tracking device Maslow
      gave her.

                                 MIKA (CONT'D)
                   I wanted to think you for saving
                   my life.

      Bending over him, she kisses him gently.

                   And I hope you can forgive me for

106   INT. MASLOW'S OFFICE - NIGHT                               106

      There's a crowd of other OFFICIALS there, having turned
      the place into a makeshift command and control center.
      An AIDE rushes in from an adjoining room, goes to Maslow.

                                 AIDE
                   Agent Maslow, the tracking device--

      Mika watches from the trees as a shadow comes to life on
      the balcony outside their room. It pauses as if sensing
      something.


108   INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                            108

      Raizo lies alone. The heavy shadows begin to undulate as
      the Hanta-Kirra emerge.

      Police and Europol cars scream up to the hotel.


110   EXT/INT. HIGHWAY MOTEL ROOM - DAWN                           110

      A moment later the door bursts open; Maslow and his men
      pour into the bedroom.

      The bed is empty. Raizo is gone.

      Mika is sitting in the chair.

                                    MIKA
                   They took him.     Ten minutes ago.

      Maslow embraces her.


111   FLASHBACK - INT ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT                  111

      There is a furious storm raging outside       the thin
      screened walls.

      Raizo is watching Kiriko who seems to be sleeping.

      In a flash of lightning, her eyes open and she stares at
      him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye.

      The flashing ends and as the thunder booms, she is gone,
      melting quietly into the shadows.

                                    RAIZO
                   ...no!

      Two shadows race through sheets of rain, visible in
      flashes of lightning.

      He catches her near the base of the wall.

                                   KIRIKO
                   Life.

      He cannot imagine what that life might be.

                                 RAIZO
                   ...My life is here.

      She bows her head and turns.

                                 RAIZO (CONT'D)
                   Why are you doing this?

                                 KIRIKO
                   Because I can't watch you become
                   something you are not.

      She races for the wall.

      He watches her climb...And disappear.

113   INT. METAL BOX - NIGHT                                  113

      Raizo drifts on the edge of consciousness. He can sense
      some light filtering through the edges and air holes.

      The air begins to smell familiar.

                              OZUNU (V.O.)
                We have been betrayed.


114   FLASHBACK - EXT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - DAY              114

      The clan is gathered outside, the sun beats down on the
      Spartan courtyard.

      Kiriko's body is twisted, bound to a pole like one of the
      Bonsai trees.

      Ozunu delivers his eulogy.

                              OZUNU
                A child of mine, my daughter,
                betrayed us. She refused these
                gifts. Rejected our clan.

      Raizo stands among the clan; his face a mask.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   Hers is a shame that can only be
                   purged with blood.

      He unsheathes the ancient Wakizashi, then offers the hilt
      to Takeshi.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   You who returned her shall have
                   this honor.

      Takeshi hides a smile as he takes the blade.

      Kiriko looks out into the clan and finds Raizo.      He can
      hear her heart pounding.

      Takeshi knows where she is looking as he prepares to
      strike.

      Blood pounds in Raizo's ears.

      The sword plunges into her heart.    Raizo hears it die-

      And feels his own heart stop.


115   INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - NIGHT                           115

      A bucket of water slaps Raizo awake.

      He's bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by
      thick rope that bites into his flesh.

      Ozunu stands before him, as well as the rest of the clan,
      down to the youngest of them. Watching silently.

      He looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except
      that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length
      of his face. Trace of Raizo's blade from atop the
      building in Dubai.

      When he speaks, Ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the
      rest of the clan as to Raizo.

                                  OZUNU
                   You are Ozunu. Your life is
                   meaningless compared to the
                   survival of the Clan. This is our
                   deepest truth. Because of it, we
                   have endured for hundreds of
                   years, and will endure for
                   hundreds more.

      He looks to the rest, pounding the message home.       The
      message that says hope and escape are futile.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   Weakness compels strength.
                   Betrayal begets blood. This is
                   the way of the Nine Clans.
                                        (beat)
                   This is the way of the Ninja.

      He looks back at Raizo, approaching slowly.       Taking his
      time.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   I have waited many years for this
                   moment. I have dreamed it, many
                   times.

      He hits Raizo.    Hard.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   You will suffer for seven days,
                   one day for each year you defied
                   me.

      He takes a knife, and very carefully cuts out a very
      small piece of Raizo's flesh, from the upper arm. Raizo
      doesn't cry out.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   For seven days, we
                   will...take...from you, as I have
                   just done. Everyone here will
                   take from you. Piece by piece.
                   You will live through it all, you
                   will feel through it all. You
                   will watch as the birds fight over
                   the pieces.

      He STRIKES Raizo as he did long ago, his hand jutting
      deep inside gut, flicking switches of nerves that cause
      instant agony. This time Raizo does cry out.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   You will know pain like no other
                   human being has ever known.

      He twists something in Raizo's belly and violent spasms
      wrack the young man's body. Blood burbles up through his
      mouth and flows down his chin.

                              OZUNU (CONT'D)
                Your death will be remembered for
                a thousand years as a testament to
                the will and strength of the Ozunu
                Clan.

      One last gouge in Raizo's stomach sends a heaving shudder
      through him.

      Confident, victorious, Ozunu turns and walks a few steps
      away as --

      -- Raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor.

      Takeshi smiles at this, then looks more closely, seeing
      something amidst the bile...

                               TAKESHI
                Father...

      Ozunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder.    A
      single LED light blinking through the gore.

      He nudges it with his foot...and TIME SLOWS DOWN as he
      realizes what he's looking at. He slowly raises his eyes
      --

      -- and meets Raizo's gaze as suddenly --

      -- EXPLOSIONS rock the orphanage's centuries-old gate.

      A reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of
      splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of
      blinding lights.

      The Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves
      into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more
      vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights.

      The ninjas take to the shadows, trying to melt away, but
      the shadows are gone. There's no place for the ninjas to
      hide anymore. We FIND Mika and Maslow in one of the lead
      vehicles as --

      -- Takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc, raising it
      over Raizo's helpless form.

      Maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off
      a long burst.

      Takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and
      dodges the others. He slides into one of the few
      remaining shadows.

      One of the soldiers sees him making a break for it and
      fires an incendiary grenade.

      The explosion sends incandescent white phosphorous
      splashing through the courtyard, but Takeshi is gone.
      They prepare to fire another one when Maslow comes on the
      run.

                              MASLOW
                No more grenades, not until we get
                the children out!

      But some parts of the orphanage are already on fire, the
      flames spreading through the ancient timbers.

      The carnage continues.

      Maslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as Mika rushes for
      Raizo, pistol in hand.

      One of the MP's screams as a shuriken rips open his face
      as other Mps FIRE back at the ninja, tearing him apart
      with gunfire.

      Mika makes it to Raizo's side.

      He smiles at her as she saws through the rope with her
      knife.

                                 RAIZO
                What took you?

                              MIKA
                You knew I'd come?

                              RAIZO
                Just because I was asleep doesn't
                mean I couldn't hear you.

      Mika finishes with the rope. Raizo pulls free and
      reaches for a fallen ninja's sword and chain.

                              RAIZO (CONT'D)
                And I forgive you.

      Mika looks back at the sound of GUNFIRE tearing apart
      another ninja. When she looks back --

      -- Raizo is gone.

116   INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN/DINING/DORMITORY/DOJO - NIGHT     116

      The fires are ripping through the interior, leaping from
      bamboo furniture to paper shoji screens to polished
      wooden floors as --

      -- Raizo kicks down the burning wall of the empty dorm,
      the futons smoldering.

      Raizo continues into the next hall to find --

      -- Takeshi waiting for him. An apparition in the
      wavering blaze of heat, silhouetted against a wall of
      fire.

                               TAKESHI
                Come, little brother, let us play
                like old times

      They spring at other. Meeting in the middle of the
      hallway as the flames dance around them...recalling the
      lanterns they used to fight through, in the days of their
      training.

      Their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on
      steel. Neither giving an inch. Evenly matched in skill
      and ferocity. Locking together for a moment Takeshi
      smiles.

                              TAKESHI (CONT'D)
                No death tasted as sweet as hers.

      Raizo's back glistens orange in the firelight, sweat
      pouring as he strains, attacks, defends and attacks
      again.

      Takeshi jumps over them, twists mid-air and ducks low
      beneath Raizo's swinging chain as --

      -- Raizo stumbles back on the polished floor, blocking
      Takeshi's attack, but --

      -- Takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip. As he
      brings his sword around, Raizo gets a loop of chain
      around the blade and locks it tight.

      Both men spin in their sudden embrace.   Faces inches from
      each other.

                              TAKESHI (CONT'D)
                I watched you die when I pierced
                her heart. You have always been
                too weak to be Ozunu.

      Takeshi's finger trips a hidden button on the sword.

      The blade retracts back through the handle and a yard of
      steel jolts out from the hilt of Takeshi's sword.

      He moves to slam it into Raizo's side...but Raizo FLIPS
      over him, holding onto the hilt and as he lands he --

      -- DRIVES the steel into Takeshi's heart. He still
      stands for a BEAT, more by inertia than will, then
      slumps, dead, to the floor.

      Raizo stalks down the hall.    One last task ahead of him.


117   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR/MASTERS      117
      ROOM/ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

      Raizo walks across the Nightingale floor, his bloody
      footprints moving soundlessly.

      From the shadows he hears Ozunu's voice

                                 OZUNU
                   You have not forgotten your
                   training. You will always be
                   mine, child.

      Raizo stops, considers this, then continues; his
      footsteps now bringing every sound possible.

      Ozunu steps out of the darkness, as though shrugging off
      a cloak of midnight.

                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)
                   Perhaps this is the best way for
                   you to die.

      His blade rises as like a Cobra's hood, while the chain
      blade begins to spin.

                                 RAIZO
                   The breath I take after you are
                   dead, will be the first of my
                   life.

      Raizo unleashes all his fury: The chain cutting with the
      power of an enormous buzz saw--

      Hacking timbers in half--

      Carving scars in the floors and walls--

      Braziers are thrown, fumes begin to spread but--

      Ozunu blocks or evades, absorbing the assault patiently

118   EXT. ORPHANAGE - COURTYARD - NIGHT                             118

      A portion of the Orphanage's wall burns through.        Mika
      spots Raizo through the flames.

      She runs for him.


119   INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT               119

      Raizo begins to weaken. An attack misses wrapping a beam
      and Ozunu has his opening-

      His assault is ferocious.

      Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood
      billowing out.

      Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or
      deflecting the whirlwind attack until--

      One sound cuts through the furious fight.

      Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as--

      The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place.

                                   MIKA
                   Die you fuck!

      She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet
      grazes him.

                                   OZUNU
                   Bitch!

      A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor.
      But the distraction gives Raizo his chance.

      The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of
      Ozunu.

      Rage thunders the hall.

      Mika gets back up and aims but--

      Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as
      he disappears.

                                   MIKA

      She cannot see him.

      Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst,
      his blade shatters through Raizo's chain--

      Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his
      chest.

      Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces.

                                  RAIZO
                   Mika! Run!

                                  MIKA
                   Where is he?   I can't see him!

                                  RAIZO
                   Get away!

      Ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith. His
      eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull.

      She spins around but is too late.

      The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as-
      -

      Raizo finds them.

      He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls--

      His pain a force of nature unleashed.

      The chain blades crackle in the air-

      Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which-

      Finally shatters against Raizo's fury.

      And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the
      whistling blades lazering through his body until he
      separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched
      rag doll.

      Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and--

      --hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks
      through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the

      The fighting is over now.     All the combatant ninjas dead
      or long gone.

      Maslow sees Raizo emerge from the smoke and flames,
      carrying Mika in his arms.

                                    MASLOW
                   Mika!

      He runs to her side as Raizo lays her gently on the
      ground.

                                    MASLOW (CONT'D)
                   What happened?

                                 RAIZO
                   She saved my life.

      Raizo puts his hand on her chest. Closes his eyes.          We
      can FEEL her heart-beat. Bump-thump. Bump-thump.

      Raizo opens his eyes.

                                 RAIZO (CONT'D)
                   She will be all right.

                                 MASLOW
                   How can you be sure?

      Raizo touches her face as she takes in a sudden breath.
      He smiles distantly.

                                 RAIZO
                   Her heart is special.

                                   MIKA
                   Medic!    Over here now!

      Several medics rush to them, Raizo gently laying her on
      the stretcher.

      As they immediately begin working on her, Raizo fades
      back.

      Maslow remains at her side.

      Her eyes flutter open.

                                 MASLOW
                   Is she going to be okay?

                                 MEDIC
                   I don't know...she's got a hole
                   right through the middle of her
                   heart...but shes not really
                   bleeding, that badly...

                 My heart...

       She points to the right side of her chest.

                               MIKA (CONT'D)
                 ...is over here.

                               MASLOW
                 ...you gotta be fucking kidding
                 me.

                                MIKA
                 ...Raizo?

                               MASLOW
                 He said you saved his life.

       She smiles.

                               MASLOW (CONT'D)
                 So you kept your promise. Can we
                 go home now?


121    EXT. ORPHANAGE BONSAI GARDEN - DAY                         121

       Raizo stands among the bound trees.

                               RAIZO (V.O.)
                 You shouldn't do that.

      We hear his heartbeat. Bump-thump Bump-thump.

      As he stands on the edge of the wall.

      In the next moment he is gone-

      And finally, free.

      FADE OUT.
"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU"


 

			 "O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU"

					  By

			   Ethan Coen and Joel Coen

	BLACK

	In black, we hear a chain-gang chant, many voices together, 
	spaced around the unison strike of picks against rock. A 
	title burns in:

	O muse! 
	Sing in me, and through me tell the story 
	Of that man skilled in all the ways of contending... 
	A wanderer, harried for years on end...

	On the sound of an impact we cut to:

	A PICK

	splitting a rock.

	As the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at 
	work. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, 
	chained together, working under a brutal midday sun.

	It is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road 
	stretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily 
	patrol the line.

	The chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless.

	We slowly fade out, returning to

	BLACK

	The last of the voices fades.

	After a long beat we hear the guitar introduction to Harry 
	McClintock's 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain.'

	A WHEAT FIELD

	A road cuts across the middle background. Noonday sun beats 
	down.

	We hear the distant picks and shovels of men at work and 
	see, rising above ground level, the occasional upraised pick 
	and spade heaving dirt. Men are digging a ditch alongside 
	the road.

	After a long beat, three men pop up in the wheat field in 
	the middle foreground. They wear faded stripes and grey duck-
	billed caps. They scurry abreast toward the camera, throwing 
	an occasional glance back at the ditch-diggers. A clanking 
	sound accompanies their run. Oddly, the wheat between them 
	sweeps down as they run. After a brief sprint they drop back 
	down into the wheat.

	In the background a man enters frame left, strolling along 
	the road, wearing a khaki uniform and sunglasses, a shotgun 
	resting against one shoulder. He glances idly down into the 
	ditch and strolls on out of frame right.

	The three men rise back up from the wheat and, clanking, 
	resume their sprint.

	THREE PAIRS OF EYES

	They are topped by three cap bills, and peer out from behind 
	a blind of greenery. We hear distant whistling.

	The men are looking at a weathered barn. A young boy, 
	whistling, is heading down the road that leads away from the 
	barn, jiggling the traces of the old plough horse that leads 
	him. He turns a corner and is gone.

	BARNYARD

	The three clanking men (we can now see their leg irons) are 
	awkwardly chasing a chicken around the yard. The squawking 
	yardbird doesn't need to move much to elude the three bunched 
	men.

	COUNTRY LANE

	It curves in a gentle S into the background. It is sun-
	dappled, pretty.

	We hear clanking footsteps approaching at a trot.

	The three men enter in the foreground and trot on down the 
	lane. The leftmost has a flapping chicken tucked under one 
	arm.

	AFTERNOON CAMPFIRE

	The three men sit in a side-by-side arc around a dying fire, 
	one of them contentedly picking his teeth with a small chicken 
	bone, another wiping grease off his chin with a sleeve, the 
	third idly poking at the fire with a spit.

	Each of them, still bound by chains, clinks as he moves.

	One of them abruptly cocks his head, listening.

	The others notice his attitude and also freeze, listening.

	We hear the distant baying of hounds.

	ROLLING HILLS

	From high on a ridge we see the three chained men running 
	toward us.

	In addition to their clanks we hear a distant chugging sound.

	TRACKING

	Laterally with the clanking, running feet.

	The chugging sound is very loud.

	RUNNING

	Next to a freight train. A boxcar door is open.

	INSIDE THE BOXCAR

	The lead convict hooks an elbow in and starts hauling himself 
	up, his two clanking friends keeping pace outside.

	Six hobos sit in the boxcar, lounging against sacks of 
	O'Daniel's Flour. They impassively watch the convict clamber 
	in as his two confederates run to keep up.

	The convict hauls himself to his feet. In spite of his stubble 
	he has carefully tended hair and a pencil mustache. He is 
	Everett.

	As he dusts himself off:

				EVERETT
		Say, uh, any a you boys smithies?

	The hobos stare.

	Everett gives an ingratiating smile as, behind him, the second 
	convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar, the third 
	convict still keeping pace outside.

				EVERETT
		Or, if not smithies per se, were you 
		otherwise trained in the metallurgic 
		arts before straitened circumstances 
		forced you into a life of aimless 
		wanderin'?

	The convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and 
	disappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately 
	after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward in 
	turn, smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the 
	open doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves 
	on the boxcar floorboards.

	The hobos impassively watch.

	OUTSIDE

	The three men tumble, clanking, down the track embankment.

	Squush - they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom.

	They shake their heads clear, then rise to their feet in the 
	muck and watch the train recede.

	Its fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds.

				EVERETT
		Jesus - can't I count on you people?

	The second con is Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Sorry, Everett.

	Everett looks desperately about.

				EVERETT
		All right - if we take off through 
		that bayou-

	The third con, Pete, bald but also with beard stubble, angrily 
	cuts in.

				PETE
		Wait a minute! Who elected you leader 
		a this outfit?

				EVERETT
		Well, Pete, I just figured it should 
		be the one with capacity for abstract 
		thought. But if that ain't the 
		consensus view, hell, let's put her 
		to a vote!

				PETE
		Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!

				EVERETT
		Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!

	Both men look interrogatively to Delmar.

	He looks from Pete to Everett, and nods agreeably.

				DELMAR
		Okay - I'm with you fellas.

	Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen.

	The baying of hounds is louder now, but through it we hear a 
	distant scrape of metal against metal, like the workings of 
	a rusty pump. The men turn in unison to look up the track.

	A small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward 
	them.

	As it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. 
	An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw 
	handle.

	The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to 
	show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs.

	The flatcar draws even and slows.

				EVERETT
		Mind if we join you, ol' timer?

				OLD MAN
		Join me, my sons.

	The three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping.

	The three men exchange glances; Delmar waves a clanking hand 
	before the old man's milky eyes. No reaction.

				DELMAR
		You work for the railroad, grandpa?

				OLD MAN
		I work for no man.

				PETE
		Got a name, do ya?

				OLD MAN
		I have no name.

				EVERETT
		Well, that right there may be why 
		you've had difficulty finding gainful 
		employment. Ya see, in the mart of 
		competitive commerce, the-

				OLD MAN
		You seek a great fortune, you three 
		who are now in chains...

	The men fall silent.

				OLD MAN
		And you will find a fortune - though 
		it will not be the fortune you seek...

	The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the 
	blind prophet.

				OLD MAN
		...But first, first you must travel 
		a long and difficult road - a road 
		fraught with peril, uh-huh, and 
		pregnant with adventure. You shall 
		see things wonderful to tell. You 
		shall see a cow on the roof of a 
		cottonhouse, uh-huh, and oh, so many 
		startlements...

	The cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the 
	track as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame.

				OLD MAN
		...I cannot say how long this road 
		shall be. But fear not the obstacles 
		in your path, for Fate has vouchsafed 
		your reward.  And though the road 
		may wind, and yea, your hearts grow 
		weary, still shall ye foller the 
		way, even unto your salvation.

	The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate 
	his words.

	Loud and sudden:

				OLD MAN
		IZZAT CLEAR?

	The men start, then mumble polite acknowledgement.

	The railroad tracks wind to the setting sun. Reek-a reek-a 
	reek-a - the flatcar rolls, in wide shot, toward the golden 
	horizon.

								FADE OUT

	DAY

	A hot dusty road leading up to a lone farmhouse.

	The three men walk, clanking and abreast.

				DELMAR
		How'd he know about the treasure?

				EVERETT
		Don't know, Delmar-though the blind 
		are reputed to possess sensitivities 
		compensatin' for their lack of sight, 
		even to the point of developing para-
		normal psychic powers. Now clearly, 
		seein' the future would fall neatly 
		into that ka-taggery. It's not so 
		surprising, then, if an organism 
		deprived of earthly vision-

				PETE
		He said we wouldn't get it! He said 
		we wouldn't get the treasure we seek!

	Everett grows testy:

				EVERETT
		Well what does he know - he's an 
		ignorant old man! Jesus, Pete, I'm 
		telling you I buried it myself, and 
		if your cousin still runs this-here 
		horse farm and has a forge and some 
		shoein' impediments to restore our 
		liberty of movement-

	Bang! A rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men.

				CHILD'S VOICE
		Hold it rah chair!

	The front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front 
	porch and a dark screen door.

	The screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the 
	porch and steps down into the sunlight, holding a gun almost 
	bigger than he is. The grimy-faced boy, about eight years 
	old, wears tattered overalls.

				CHILD
		You men from the bank?

				PETE
		You Wash's boy?

				CHILD
		Yassir! And Daddy tolt me I'm to 
		shoot whosoever from the bank!

	He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands.

				DELMAR
		Well, we ain't from no bank, young 
		feller.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I'm also suppose to shoot 
		folks servin' papers!

				DELMAR
		Well we ain't got no papers.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I nicked the census man!

				DELMAR
		There's a good boy. Is your daddy 
		about?

	THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

	Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted 
	bathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm 
	implements overgrown with weeds. He is whittling artlessly 
	at a stick.

	He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, 
	then returns to his whittling.

				WASH
		'Lo, Pete. Hooor yer friends?

				EVERETT
		Pleased to make your acquaintance, 
		Mister Hogwallop. M'name's Ulysses 
		Everett McGill.

				DELMAR
		'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.

				PETE
		How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, 
		thirteen year'n?

	Still looking sourly at his whittling:

				WASH
		You've grown chatty.

	He tosses the stick aside and sighs.

				WASH
		I expect you'll want them chains 
		knocked off.

	THE HOGWALLOP KITCHEN

	The four men and little boy sit around the kitchen table 
	eating stew. A Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair 
	brings him to table height. The cons are now rid of their 
	chains and are dressed in ill-fitting farmer's wear.

	WASH

	They foreclosed on Cousin Vester. He hanged himself a year 
	come May.

				PETE
		And Uncle Ratliff?

				WASH
		The anthrax took most of his cows. 
		The rest don't milk, and he lost a 
		boy to mumps.

				PETE
		Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

	Wash glances at the little boy.

				WASH
		Couldn't say. Mrs. Hogwallop up and 
		R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

				EVERETT
		Mm. Must've been lookin' for answers.

				WASH
		Possibly. Good riddance, far as I'm 
		concerned...

	The three men slurp their stew.

				WASH
		I do miss her cookin' though.

				DELMAR
		This stew's awful good.

				WASH
		Think so?

	He sniffs dubiously at his spoon.

				WASH
		I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday; 
		'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

	LIVING ROOM

	Later. The four men sit about listening to a big box radio. 
	Wash is whittling once again; Everett dips his comb into a 
	pomade jar and carefully works on his hair; Pete is digging 
	around with a toothpick; Delmar dreamily waves one hand in 
	time to the music.

	The music ends.

				ANNOUNCER
		Well, that's the last number for 
		tonight's 'Pass the Biscuits Pappy 
		O'Daniel Flour Hour.' This is Pappy 
		O'Daniel, hopin' you folks been 
		enjoyin' that good old-timey music, 
		and remember, when you're fixin' to 
		fry up some flapjacks or bake a mess 
		a biscuits, use cool clear water and 
		good pure Pappy O'Daniel flour for 
		that 'Pass the Biscuits, Pappy' 
		flavor.  So tune in next week folks, 
		and till then whyncha turn to your 
		better half and sing along with Pappy: 
		'You are my sunshine, my only 
		sunshine...'

	Everett clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Well, guess I'll be turning in...

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

				EVERETT
		Say, Cousin Wash, I guess it'd be 
		the acme of foolishness to inquire 
		if you had a hairnet.

				WASH
		Got a bunch in yon byurra.  Mrs. 
		Hogwallop's, matter of fact.  
		Hepyaseff; I won't be needin' 'em.

	THE THREE MEN

	Sleeping in a hayloft. Everett wears a hairnet over his 
	painstakingly arranged hair.

	Pete snores on the inhale. Delmar whistles on the exhale.

	A spotlight plays over the hayloft ceiling and a voice booms:

				BULLHORN VOICE
		All right boys, itsy authorities.

	The three men rouse themselves.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		We gotcha surrounded. Just come on 
		out grabbin' air!

	Everett shrugs his shoulders and peeks down into the barnyard.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	From high we see a foreshortened lawman holding a bullhorn 
	surrounded by armed deputies.

	Next to the man with the bullhorn, a tin-starred sheriff 
	watches impassively through mirrored sunglasses, a bloodhound 
	drooling at his side.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		And don't try nothin' fancy - your 
		sitchy-ation is purt nigh hopeless.

				DELMAR
		What inna Sam Hill...?

				EVERETT
		Pete's cousin turned us in for the 
		bounty!

				PETE
		The hell you say! Wash is kin!

	An unamplified voice echoes up from the yard:

				VOICE
		Sorry Pete! I know we're kin! But 
		they got this Depression on, and I 
		gotta do fer me and mine!

	Pete screams down from the hayport:

				PETE
		I'M GONNA KILL YOU, JUDAS ISCARIOT 
		HOGWALLOP! YOU MIS'ABLE HOSS-EATIN' 
		SONOFABITCH! YOU-

	RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT- Everett pulls Pete down as a tommy gun spits 
	lead into the hayloft.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	Pete is enraged:

				PETE
		Damn his eyes! Pa always said never 
		trust a Hogwallop-COME'N GET US, 
		COPPERS!

				BULLHORN VOICE
		So be it! You boys're leavin' us no 
		choice but to smoke you out.

				EVERETT
		Oh no! Lord have mercy!

	Men approach the barn with torches.

				DELMAR
		What do we do now, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Fire! I hate fire!

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY TIN-WEARIN' MOTHERLESS
		BARNBURNIN' COCKROACHES-

	Everett cuts in, his voice breaking:

				EVERETT
		NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD 
		OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK 
		THIS THING OUT!

				DELMAR
		Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

	The hayloft is filling with smoke. Flames lick downstairs.

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN 
		SKUNKS-

				EVERETT
		Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak 
		with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH 
		THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!

	Pete grabs a flaming faggot and hurls it down at the deputized 
	congregation.

	It lands harmlessly in some scattered straw.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		You choose it, boys - the prison 
		farm or the pearly gates!

	The straw curls, lights, and the fire scuttles over to a 
	parked Black Maria.

	With a loud airy WHOOOF! the undercarriage of the police van 
	pops into flame.

	The man with the bullhorn sees it.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Holy Saint Christopher - OUTA THAT 
		VEHICLE, CHAMP, SHE'S LICKIN' FAR!

	Tommy guns are stored in the back of the van. The drum of 
	one starts spinning.

	Flames lick up the outside of the van as - chinka-chinka-
	chinka - bullet holes walk across the body.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Take cover, boys, THAT AIN'T POPCORN!

	Yelling men scurry away.

	The vehicle rocks and chatters under the force of the many 
	tommy guns now firing inside. Tires pop, hiss and settle; 
	doors pop open; glass shatters.

				VOICES
		Who's that?

	An oncoming car is bouncing crazily across the yard, horn 
	blaring. Deputies leap out of its path.

	The car shoots past the chattering van which still bucks and 
	bounces on its shocks, its interior strobing and flashing as 
	if filled with trapped lightning.

	The speeding car heads directly for the flaming barn door 
	and crashes through in a shower of sparks.

	The car brakes inside the barn and the driver's door flies 
	open. The little Hogwallop boy yells over the roar of the 
	flames:

				BOY
		Come on, boys! I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-
		T!

	Pete, Everett and Delmar pile in.

				DELMAR
		You should be in bed, little fella.

	The doors slam shut and the boy grinds into gear. He has 
	wood blocks strapped to his feet so that he can reach 
	accelerator, brake and clutch. He sits on a Sears Roebuck 
	catalogue to give him a view over the dash.

				BOY
		You ain't the boss a me!

	The car speeds for the far wall, sheeted in flame, and bursts 
	through.

	COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	The little Hogwallop boy walks away in long shot down the 
	middle of the empty road. His walk is unsteady, the wood 
	blocks still strapped to his feet.

	He turns to face us and hollers:

				BOY
		You candy-butted car-thievin' so's 
		'n so's! I curse yer names!

	Pete enters in the foreground and throws a dirt clod at the 
	boy. It lands shy as Pete yells:

				PETE
		Go back home'n mind yer pa!

	We pan Pete over to the shoulder where the car is stopped, 
	its hood propped open. Everett and Delmar are looking at the 
	engine.

				PETE
		What's the damn problem?

	DRYGOODS STORE

	The proprietor is a bespectacled middle-aged man wearing 
	sleeve garters and a visor. Behind him are stacked, among 
	other necessaries, sacks of O'Daniel Flour. He pushes a small 
	tin across the counter.

				PROPRIETOR
		I can get the part from Bristol; 
		it'll take two weeks. Here's your 
		pomade.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		Two weeks! That don't do me no good!

				PROPRIETOR
		Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

	Everett picks up the tin.

				EVERETT
		Hold on there - I don't want this 
		pomade, I want Dapper Dan.

				PROPRIETOR
		I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry 
		Fop.

				EVERETT
		No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I 
		use Dapper Dan!

				PROPRIETOR
		Watch your language, young fellow, 
		this is a public market. Now, if you 
		want Dapper Dan I can order it for 
		you, have it in a couple of weeks.

				EVERETT
		Well, ain't this place a geographical 
		oddity-two weeks from everywhere!  
		Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!

	PETE AND DELMAR

	On a wooded hillside. They sit at a twig fire, roasting a 
	small creature on a spit.

				EVERETT (O.S.)
		It didn't look like a one-horse 
		town...

	He stalks into frame and plops disgustedly down by the fire.

				EVERETT
		...but try getting a decent hair 
		jelly.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

				EVERETT
		And no transmission belt for two 
		weeks neither.

				PETE
		Huh?! They dam that river on the 
		21st.  Today's the 17th!

				EVERETT
		Don't I know it.

				PETE
		We got but four days to get to that 
		treasure! After that, it'll be at 
		the bottom of a lake!

	He grimly shakes his head.

				PETE
		We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

	Everett has taken out a can of near-empty Dapper Dan. He 
	scrapes the last of it onto his comb and starts combing his 
	hair.

	We hear distant singing - one lone tenor voice.

				EVERETT
		Well, you're right there, but the 
		ol' tactician's already got a plan-

	Everett fishes a gold watch from his pocket and tosses it to 
	Pete.

				EVERETT
		-for the transportation, that is; I 
		don't know how I'm gonna keep my 
		coiffure in order.

	Pete looks at the watch, puzzled.

				PETE
		How's this a plan? How're we gonna 
		get a car?

				EVERETT
		Sell that. I figured it could only 
		have painful associations for Wash.

	Pete pops the front and reads the inscription.

				PETE
		To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop.  
		From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie-
		dellis.

				EVERETT
		It was in his bureau.

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

	Delmar whistles appreciatively.

				DELMAR
		You got light fingers, Everett. 
		Gopher?

				PETE
		You mis'able little sneak thief...

	He lurches threateningly to his feet.

				PETE
		You stole from my kin!

	Everett scrambles up.

				EVERETT
		Who was fixing to betray us!

				PETE
		You didn't know that at the time!

				EVERETT
		So I borrowed it till I did know!

				PETE
		That don't make no sense!

				EVERETT
		Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in 
		the chambers of the human heart. 
		What the hell's that singing?

	We can make out the words now, sung by the lone tenor.

				VOICE
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you wanna go down...

	People in white robes are drifting down the hill, through 
	the woods behind the campsite. They join in with the lead 
	voice:

				VOICES
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, down to 
		the river to pray...

	Delmar gazes wonderingly at the white-robed figures as he 
	answers Everett:

				DELMAR
		Appears to be... some kinda... con-
		gur-gation. Care for some gopher?

	Everett too watches the white-robed people following in the 
	wake of the tenor. He answers absently:

				EVERETT
		No, thank you Delmar - a third of a 
		gopher would only rouse my appetite 
		without beddin' her back down.

	There are more and more white robes drifting through the 
	woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men.

				DELMAR
		You can have the whole thing - me'n 
		Pete already had one...

	There is an endless stream now, drifting through the 
	foreground, the background, the campsite itself.

				VOICES
		Oh, sisters, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you want to go down...

				DELMAR
		We ran acrost a gopher village...

	The drifting worshipers wear beatific expressions. One only, 
	a middle-aged woman, notices the three convicts around whom 
	the rest of the flock blindly drifts. She calls to them:

				WOMAN
		Come with us, brothers! Join us and 
		be saved!

	THE RIVER

	White robes stream down the hill, out of the woods, and down 
	the riverbank. The voices swell in a great chorus:

				VOICES
		We went down to the river one day, 
		Studying about that good old way, 
		And who shall wear that robe and 
		crown, Oh Lord, show us the way...

	We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground. 
	He stands belly-deep in the river, easing a white-robed man 
	back-down into the water. Behind him a line of robed singers 
	lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods.

	Pete, Delmar and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down 
	at the river. White-robed people continue to drift past them.

				EVERETT
		I guess hard times flush the chumps.  
		Everybody's lookin' for answers, and 
		there's always-

	Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line.

				EVERETT
		Where the hell's he goin'?

	Delmar has reached the minister and holds his nose as the 
	minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water.

				PETE
		Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's 
		been saved!

				EVERETT
		Pete, don't be ignorant-

	Delmar is slogging back through the water.

				DELMAR
		Well that's it boys, I been redeemed!  
		The preacher warshed away all my 
		sins and transgressions. It's the 
		straight-and-narrow from here on out 
		and heaven everlasting's my reward!

				EVERETT
		Delmar what the hell are you talking 
		about? - We got bigger fish to fry-

				DELMAR
		Preacher said my sins are warshed 
		away, including that Piggly Wiggly I 
		knocked over in Yazoo!

				EVERETT
		I thought you said you were innocent 
		a those charges.

				DELMAR
		Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to 
		say that that sin's been warshed 
		away too!  Neither God nor man's got 
		nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, 
		the water's fine!

	LATER

	The smoldering twig fire. A bloodhound on a leash circles 
	into frame, its tail fiercely wagging.

	We follow it as, nose to the ground and straining against 
	its leash, it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan 
	pomade.

				A VOICE
		All tight, boys! We got the scent!

	A CAR

	Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile. 
	Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both 
	dripping wet.

	Pete is sullen:

				PETE
		The preacher said it absolved us.

				EVERETT
		For him, not for the law! I'm 
		surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave 
		you credit for more brains than 
		Delmar.

				DELMAR
		But there were witnesses, saw us 
		redeemed!

				EVERETT
		That's not the issue, Delmar. Even 
		if it did put you square with the 
		Lord, the State of Mississippi is 
		more hardnosed.

				DELMAR
		You should a joined us, Everett. It 
		couldn't a hurt none.

				PETE
		Hell, at least it woulda washed away 
		the stink of that pomade.

				EVERETT
		Join you two ignorant fools in a 
		ridiculous superstition? Thank you 
		anyway.  And I like the smell of my 
		hair treatment - the pleasing odor 
		is half the point.

	He shakes his head and laughs.

				EVERETT
		Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a 
		bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're 
		my cross to bear-

				DELMAR
		Pull over, Everett - let's give that 
		colored boy a lift.

	A thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes stands 
	on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. He 
	grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and 
	trots up to the open window.

				HITCHHIKER
		You folks goin' through Tishamingo?

	Delmar pushes open the back door.

				DELMAR
		Sure, hop in.

	Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls 
	out.

				EVERETT
		How ya doin', boy? Name's Everett, 
		and these two soggy sonsabitches are 
		Pete and Delmar. Keep your fingers 
		away from Pete's mouth-he ain't had 
		nothin' to eat for the last thirteen 
		years but prison food, gopher, and a 
		little greasy horse.

				HITCHHIKER
		Thank you fuh the lif', suh. M'names 
		Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

	Delmar is genuinely friendly:

				DELMAR
		How ya doin', Tommy. I haven't seen 
		a house in miles. What're you doin' 
		out in the middle of nowhere?

	Tommy is matter-of-fact:

				TOMMY
		I had to be at that crossroads las' 
		midnight to sell mah soul to the 
		devil.

				EVERETT
		Well ain't it a small world, 
		spiritually speakin'! Pete and Delmar 
		just been baptized and saved! I guess 
		I'm the only one here who remains 
		unaffiliated!

				DELMAR
		This ain't no laughin' matter, 
		Everett.

				EVERETT
		What'd the devil give you for your 
		soul, Tommy?

				TOMMY
		He taught me to play this guitar 
		real good.

	Delmar is horrified:

				DELMAR
		Oh, son! For that you traded your 
		everlastin' soul?!

	Tommy shrugs.

				TOMMY
		I wudden usin' it.

				PETE
		I always wondered-what's the devil 
		look like?

				EVERETT
		Well, of course there's all manner 
		of lesser imps'n demons, Pete, but 
		the Great Satan hisself is red and 
		scaly with a bifurcated tail and 
		carries a hayfork.

				TOMMY
		Oh no! No suh! He's white-white as 
		you folks, with mirrors for eyes an'  
		a big hollow voice an' allus travels 
		with a mean old hound.

				PETE
		And he told you to go to Tishamingo?

				TOMMY
		No suh, that was mah idea. I heard 
		they's a man there pays folks money 
		to sing into a can. They say he pays 
		extra effen you play real good.

	Everett's eyes narrow as he studies the man in the rearview.

				EVERETT
		How much does he pay?

	TISHAMINGO

	The car is pulling into the parking lot of a single-story 
	cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a 
	handpainted sign:

	WEZY 
	LISTENING AIN'T NEVER BEEN 
	SO EASY NOR 
	SO FINE

	As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders.

				EVERETT
		All right boys, just follow my lead.

	INSIDE

	Everett strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears 
	dark glasses and holds a white cane.

				EVERETT
		Who's the honcho around here?

				MAN
		I am. Hur you?

				EVERETT
		Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers 
		and these here are the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi-
		Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. 
		We hear you pay good money to sing 
		into a can.

				MAN
		Well that all depends. You boys do 
		Negro songs?

	Everett grimaces, thinking.

				EVERETT
		Sir, we are Negroes. All except our 
		a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, 
		the fella that plays the gui-tar.

				MAN
		Well, I don't record Negro songs. 
		I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey 
		material.  Why, people just can't 
		get enough of it since we started 
		broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel 
		Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' 
		by, but-

				EVERETT
		Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been 
		steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, 
		you're silly with it, aintcha boys?

				PETE
		That's right!

				DELMAR
		That's right! We ain't really Negroes!

				PETE
		All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!

	THE STUDIO

	The three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, 
	who plays his guitar into a can microphone. They are 
	performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant 
	Sorrow'.

	When they finish Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back.

				EVERETT
		Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you 
		did sell your soul to the devil!

				MAN
		Boys, that was some mighty fine 
		pickin' and singin'. You just sign 
		these papers and I'll give you ten 
		dollars apiece.

				EVERETT
		Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll 
		have to scratch Xes - only four of 
		us can write.

	THE LOT

	A caravan of two oversize cars is pulling into the lot just 
	as Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station 
	door, whooping it up.

	A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by 
	suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly is 
	getting out of the first car. His face is familiar from 
	countless sacks of Pass the Biscuits Pappy O'Daniel Flour.

	Delmar waves a fistful of money at him.

				DELMAR
		Hey mister! I don't mean to be tellin' 
		tales out a school, but there's a 
		man in there hands out ten dollars 
		to anyone sings into his can!

				PAPPY
		I'm not here to make a record, ya 
		dumb cracker, they broadcast me out 
		on the radio.

	A big shambling man of about thirty has followed him out of 
	the car. He has the sloping shoulders, the pasty skin, and 
	the aimlessly bobbing head of an intellectual flyweight.

				JUNIOR
		That's Governor Menelaus 'Pass the 
		Biscuits, Pappy' O'Daniel, and he'd 
		sure 'preciate it if you ate his 
		farina and voted him a second term.

	Two other members of the retinue, older men whose girth rivals 
	the governor's, are Eckard and Spivey.

				ECKARD
		Finest governor we've ever had in 
		M'sippi.

				SPIVEY
		In any state.

				ECKARD
		Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; 
		I was makin' the larger point.

	As Pappy brushes by them, Junior wheedles:

				JUNIOR
		Aintcha gonna press the flesh, Pappy, 
		do a little politickin'?

	Pappy slaps at the young man with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'll press your flesh, you dimwitted 
		sonofabitch - you don't tell your 
		pappy how to cawt the elect 'rate!

	Pappy waves his hat at the radio building as singers in faux 
	hillbilly outfits with various musical instrument cases get 
	out of the second car.

				PAPPY
		We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we 
		mass communicatin'!

				ECKARD
		Oh, yes, assa parful new force.

				SPIVEY
		Mm-mm.

	The men head for the station, with Junior lagging.

				PAPPY
		Shake a leg, Junior! Thank God your 
		mama died givin' birth-if she'd a 
		seen ya she'd a died of shame...

	A CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	Tommy sits in the background, playing and singing a slow 
	blues. The three convicts, holding coffee cups, gaze into 
	the fire.

	Over the dreamy song:

				DELMAR
		Why don't we bed down out here 
		tonight?

				PETE
		Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

				EVERETT
		Suits me...

	He stretches out.

				EVERETT
		Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but 
		feather beds'n silk sheets.

	Pete swishes his coffee as he stares into the blaze.

				PETE
		A million dollars.

				EVERETT
		Million point two.

				DELMAR
		Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

				EVERETT
		Four hundred, Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Izzat right?

				EVERETT
		What're you gonna do with your share 
		of the treasure, Pete?

				PETE
		Go out west somewhere, open a fine 
		restaurant. I'm gonna be the maider 
		dee.  Greet all the swells, go to 
		work ever' day in a bowtie and tuxedo, 
		an' all the staff'll all say Yassir 
		and Nawsir and in a Jiffy Pete...

	He gives his coffee a thoughtful swish and murmurs:

				PETE
		An' all my meals for free...

				EVERETT
		What about you, Delmar? What're you 
		gonna do with your share a that dough?

				DELMAR
		Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns 
		down at the Indianola Savings and 
		Loan and slap that cash down on the 
		barrelhead and buy back the family 
		farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man 
		if you ain't got land.

				PETE
		What about you, Everett? What'd you 
		have in mind when you stoled it in 
		the first place?

				EVERETT
		Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still 
		don't, really.

				PETE
		Well that hardly sounds like you...

	A distant Voice:

				VOICE
		All right, boys, itsy authorities!

	The three men tense up. Tommy stops singing.

				VOICE
		Your sitchy-ation is purt nigh 
		hopeless!

	Pete shovels dirt onto the fire as Delmar and Everett scramble 
	to peek over a low ridge.

	Their point-of-view shows a lone barn with their car parked 
	to one side. Various police vehicles have pulled up facing 
	the barn, and armed men, their backs to us, train guns on 
	it, some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars.

				EVERETT
		Damn! They found our car!

	The man with the bullhorn continues, directing his comments 
	at the distant barn:

				MAN
		We ain't got the time-and nary 
		inclination-to gentle you boys no 
		further!

	The three convicts notice the sheriff who once again stands 
	impassively next to the man with the bullhorn, holding a 
	leash against which a bloodhound strains.

				MAN
		It's either the penal farm or the 
		fires of damnation-makes no nevermind 
		to me!

	The sheriff makes a signal to a man holding a torch, who 
	skitters up to the barn and lights it.

				DELMAR
		Damn! We gotta skedaddle!

				EVERETT
		I left my pomade in that car! Maybe 
		I can creep up!

				DELMAR
		Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R-
		U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!

				EVERETT
		Where's Tommy?

				PETE
		Already lit out, scared out of his 
		wits. Let's go!

	DAYTIME ROAD

	The three men shuffle down the dusty road.

				PETE
		The hell it ain't square one! Ain't 
		no one gonna pick up three filthy 
		unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em 
		a know-it-all that can't keep his 
		trap shut!

				EVERETT
		Pete, the personal rancor reflected 
		in that remark I don't intend to 
		dignify with comment, but I would 
		like to address your general attitude 
		of hopeless negativism. Consider the 
		lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- 
		take a look at Delmar here as your 
		paradigm a hope.

				DELMAR
		Yeah, look at me.

				EVERETT
		Now you may call it an unreasoning 
		optimism. You may call it obtuse. 
		But the plain fact is we still have... 
		close to... close to...

	He loses his drift as all three men turn, reacting to the 
	sound of an approaching speeding car.

				EVERETT
		...close to... three days... before 
		they dam that river...

	The car comes into view cornering on two wheels. It crashes 
	back onto all four and, as it speeds along, dollar bills 
	snap and flutter out its windows. The car roars up to the 
	three men as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb. It screeches to 
	a halt.

	The driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike 
	face, leans over to call through the passenger window.

				DRIVER
		Is this the road to Itta Bena?

				PETE
		Uh... Itta Bena...

	Delmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill out of the air and 
	looks at it wonderingly. He holds it stretched between two 
	hands, brings the two sides together, then gives it an 
	appraising pop.

				EVERETT
		Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...

				PETE
		Isn't it, uh...

	Like a child gazing at soap bubbles, Delmar looks around at 
	the wafting currency, and yanks another fluttering bill out 
	of the air.

				EVERETT
		I'm thinkin' it's uh, you could take 
		this road to, uh...

	There is the sound of a distant siren.

	The driver, still patiently leaning over to hear out the two 
	brainwrackers, shoots a quick look in his rearview mirror.

				PETE
		...Nah, that ain't right... I'm 
		thinkin' of...

				EVERETT
		...I believe, unless I'm very much 
		mistaken - see, we've been away for 
		several years, uh...

	The driver pushes open the passenger door.

				DRIVER
		Hop on in while you give it a think.

	The three men climb in and the car squeals out.

	INT. CAR

	The driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the 
	sirens grow louder, then gropes inside his coat.

				DRIVER
		Any a you boys know your way around 
		a Walther PPK?

				DELMAR
		Well now, that's where we cain't 
		help ya. I don't believe it's in 
		Mississippi.

	The man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his 
	passengers. Delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering 
	inside the car:

				DELMAR
		Friend, some of your folding money 
		has come unstowed.

				DRIVER
		Just stuff it down that sack there. 
		You boys aren't badmen, I take it?

				DELMAR
		Well, funny you should ask-I was 
		bad, till yesterday, but me'n Pete 
		here been saved. My name's Delmar, 
		and that there's Everett.

				DRIVER
		George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

	He opens his door and steps onto the running board, giving 
	Everett a casual:

				NELSON
		Grab the tiller, will ya buddy?

	Everett slides over, startled. George Nelson, now fully 
	outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped 
	on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other.

				NELSON
		Hand up that Thompson, Jack.

	Delmar gropes in the footwell.

				DELMAR
		Say, what line of work are you in, 
		George?

	EXT. CAR

	Nelson sends a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car.

				NELSON
		COME AND GET ME, COPPERS! YOU 
		FLATFOOTED LAMEBRAINED SOFT-ASSED 
		SONOFABITCHES! NO ONE CAN CATCH ME!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON! I'M BIGGER THAN 
		ANY JOHN LAW EVER LIVED! HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! I'M TEN-AND-A-HALF FEET TALL AND 
		AIN'T YET FULLY GROWED!

	Nelson fires wildly as the pursuit cars gain on him, returning 
	fire. He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the 
	roadside and murmurs:

				NELSON
		...cows...

	He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop.

				NELSON
		I hate cows worse than coppers!

	He lets loose a spray. One of the cows drops and the rest 
	stampede toward the road.

				DELMAR
		Aww, George, not the livestock.

	Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing:

				NELSON
		HA-HA! COME ON YOU MISERABLE SALARIED 
		SONSABITCHES! COME AND GET ME!

	In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police 
	pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. 
	The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling 
	wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes.

	SMALL TOWN

	The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through 
	light traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means 
	of clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits.

	The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the 
	three convicts emerge to follow him.

				NELSON
		COME ON BOYS! WE'RE GOIN' FOR THE 
		RECORD-THREE BANKS IN TWO HOURS!

	Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through 
	the door of the bank, followed by the three men.

	He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table.

				NELSON
		OKAY FOLKS! HOLD THE APPLAUSE AND 
		DROP YER DRAWERS - I'M GEORGE NELSON 
		AND I'M HERE TO SACK THE CITY A ITTA 
		BENA!

	He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young 
	woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on 
	the lips.

	Delmar nudges Everett.

				DELMAR
		He's a live wire though, ain't he?

				NELSON
		Thanky dear! All the money in the 
		bag, and you can tell your grandkids 
		you were done by the best! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	He winks at the three men who obediently wait.

				NELSON
		It's a kick and a quarter, ain't it 
		boys?

	Distant sirens again.

				EVERETT
		Pardon me, George, but have you got 
		a plan for gettin' outa here?

				NELSON
		Sure boys, here's m'plan!

	He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of 
	dynamite.

				NELSON
		They ain't never seen ordnance like 
		this!  WELL, THANK YOU, FOLKS, AND 
		REMEMBER: JESUS SAVES, BUT GEORGE 
		NELSON WITHDRAWS!  HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! GO FETCH THE AUTO-VOITURE, PETE!

	He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as 
	customers murmur.

				VOICE
		...it's Babyface Nelson...

	George whirls.

				NELSON
		WHO SAID THAT?!

	The customers stare mutely back.

				NELSON
		WHAT IGNORANT LOWDOWN SLANDERIZING 
		SONOFABITCH SAID THAT?! MY NAME IS 
		GEORGE NELSON, GET ME?!

	The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably 
	about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to 
	steer him toward the door.

				DELMAR
		They didn't mean anything by it, 
		George.

				NELSON
		GEORGE NELSON! NOT BABYFACE! YOU 
		REMEMBER AND YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON, BORN TO RAISE 
		HELL!

	OUTSIDE THE BANK

	The siren grows louder as the four men emerge.

				EVERETT
		You gotta be a little tolerant, 
		George; all these poor folk know is 
		the legend.  Hell, they can't be 
		expected to appreciate the complex 
		individual underneath-  

				NELSON
		Aww, I'm all right-

	He shrugs off Everett's hand and lights the fuse on a stick 
	of dynamite.

				NELSON
		This'll put me right back on top!

	The car squeals up and, as sirens approach once again, the 
	three men pile in.

				NELSON
		OR-VOIR, ITTA BENA! GEORGE NELSON 
		THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

	As the car peels out - KA-BOOM! - the dynamite blows a crater 
	in the street behind.

	CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	George Nelson, now strangely quiet, holds a coffee cup and 
	stares gloomily into the fire.

	After a long beat, Delmar, also staring into the fire, slaps 
	one knee and ejaculates:

				DELMAR
		Damn but that was some fun though, 
		won it George?!

	George responds, barely audible and without brightening:

				GEORGE
		...yeah...

	Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. Delmar, however, 
	is less sensitive to the Babyface's mood.

				DELMAR
		Almost makes me wish I hadn't been 
		saved! Jackin' up banks - I can see 
		how a fella could derive a lot a 
		pleasure and satisfaction out of it!

				GEORGE
		...it's okay...

				DELMAR
		Whoa doggies!

	At length George swishes the coffee around his cup, shrugs, 
	tosses the coffee and rises.

				GEORGE
		...Well, I'm takin' off.

	He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded 
	Delmar.

				GEORGE
		You boys can have the automobile.

	Glassy-eyed, he continues to dig in his pockets and lets his 
	money fall to the ground.

				GEORGE
		'N might as well take my share a the 
		riches.

				DELMAR
		What the - where you goin', George?

	George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the 
	campfire's flickering circle of light.

				GEORGE
		...I dunno... who cares...

	Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's 
	retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money.

				DELMAR
		Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?

				EVERETT
		Well ya know, Delmar, they say that 
		with a thrill-seekin' personality, 
		what goes up must come down. Top of 
		the world one minute, haunted by 
		megrims the next. Yep, it's like our 
		friend George is a alley cat and his 
		own damn humors're swingin' him by 
		the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; 
		he'll be back on top again. I don't 
		think we've heard the last of George 
		Nelson.

	Delmar, gazing out at the blackness that has closed over 
	George Nelson, hasn't really been listening. He turns sadly 
	back.

				DELMAR
		Damn! I liked George.

	A FIELD

	A ploughing farmer has paused to look for the source of 
	distant string-band music, growing closer. There is also an 
	approaching amplified voice:

				VOICE
		Don't be saps for Pappy; vote for 
		Stokes and responsible gummint!

	A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the 
	field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the 
	candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed 
	of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he 
	pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if 
	conducting the music.

				VOICE
		He's against the Innarests and for 
		the little man!

	This, the driver's voice, is amplified through a flared 
	speaker mounted on the roof of the cab. As the oncoming truck 
	draws near, the midget bellows out at the farmer, who has 
	removed his hat to scratch his forehead.

				MIDGET
		Greetings, brother! Vote for Stokes!

	The voice tails away:

				MIDGET
		Clean gummint is yours for the askin'!

	Our pan with the passing truck comes to rest on the WEZY 
	radio building.

	INSIDE

	We are pulling back from a close shot of the portly blind 
	man.

				MAN
		Hang on! Lemme slap up a wire.

	He turns away to load a recording as he talks into a 
	microphone.

				MAN
		Folks, here's my cousin Ezzard's 
		niece Eudora from out Greenwood doin' 
		a little number with her cousin Tom-
		Tom which I predict you're just gonna 
		enjoy thoroughly.

	He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll 
	Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his 
	attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby.

				MAN
		Now what can I do you for, Mister 
		French?

				FRENCH
		How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys?

				MAN
		Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely 
		recollect, uh -

				FRENCH
		They cut a record in here, few days 
		ago, old-timey harmony thing with a 
		guitar Accump-accump-uh-

				MAN
		Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I 
		believe, swell bunch a boys, sung 
		into yon can and skedaddled.

				FRENCH
		Well that record has just gone through 
		the goddamn roof! They're playin' it 
		as far away as Mobile! The whole 
		damn state's goin' ape!

				MAN
		It was a powerful air.

				FRENCH
		Hot damn, we gotta find those boys!  
		Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's 
		bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the 
		goddamn competition will!

				MAN
		Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that 
		competition.

	'I'll Fly Away' mixes up to play full over the following.

	MONTAGE

	- The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun 
	shimmering off the rough pavement. Their bank loot, wrapped 
	in a bandanna, is knotted to the end of a stick slung over 
	Delmar's shoulder.

	- A different road under a threatening sky. The three men 
	stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two 
	little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of 
	ice. A horse-drawn cart rumbles in from offscreen and Everett 
	waggles his thumb. Thunder rumbles.

	- A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black 
	label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy 
	Bottom Boys.

	- A high shot looking down through the rain past the dripping 
	eave of a barn, under which Everett, Pete and Delmar have 
	taken cover. The three hold their coats pinched shut at the 
	neck as they look forlornly up at the weather.

	- The three men walk along a red dirt road elevated through 
	a bayou.

	- The three men sit around a campfire. Everett sits on a 
	stump, expressively telling a ghost story as Pete and Delmar 
	gaze at him from below, wide-eyed and rapt.

	- The three men walk past a cotton field dotted with burst 
	pods.

	- A Woolworth's interior. A sad-faced woman in a calico dress 
	addresses the clerk:

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys 
		performing 'Man of Constant Sorrow'?

				CLERK
		No, ma'am, we had a new shipment in 
		yesterday but we just can't keep it 
		on the shelves.

	The sad-faced woman is crestfallen.

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, mercy. Then - just the purple 
		toilet water.

	- The three men walk down a road excavated through banks of 
	clay, from which gnarled tree roots protrude.

	- A pie rests on a windowsill, steam wafting from it. A hand 
	enters from below the sill outside and disappears with the 
	pie. A moment later we see Everett's and Pete's backs as 
	they scamper away across the yard. A short beat, and then 
	Delmar peeks over the sill. He ducks back down and then his 
	hand reaches up to leave a dollar bill. Moments later we see 
	him scampering away after Pete and Everett.

	- Another campfire. The three men sit around it laughing as 
	they enjoy the pie, each with a slab on a plate improvised 
	of old newspaper. Everett finishes his piece, licks his thumb 
	and tosses the newspaper onto the fire.

	We jump in to look at the soiled newspaper as flame begins 
	to curl its edge. A story is headlined 'TVA Finalizing Plans 
	for Flooding of Arktabutta Valley'. The flame curls the page 
	away, briefly revealing the page beneath - with a story 
	headlined 'Soggy Bottom Boys a Sensation - But Who Are They?' - 
	before it too is consumed.

	- A little general store. We are very high, looking down at 
	a foreshortened Everett, Pete, Delmar and store clerk, who 
	is wielding a long telescoping pole that stretches toward 
	us. Everett is pointing up, directing the man with the pole. 
	He moves it tentatively to and fro until, at a certain point, 
	Everett nods vigorously.

	A reverse shows the end of the pole - a long stock-pincher - 
	as it closes over a tin of Dapper Dan pomade, resting on a 
	high shelf.

	The exterior of the store shows it to be on a corner of a 
	little crossroads town. The three men are emerging from the 
	store just as a car pulls up to one of the two bubble-topped 
	gas pumps out front. A fancyman in a boater hat gets out of 
	the car and heads for the store, passing the three; Everett 
	glances at him and, as the man disappears inside, he dives 
	into his car, waving for Delmar and Pete to follow. Delmar, 
	initially reluctant, is hauled into the car by Pete, and the 
	men take off.

	- The spinning 78 recording, as the song enters its last 
	verse.

	- A spinning car wheel.

	- A panoramic boom up as the car toodles away, down a road 
	that winds through scrub grass toward a distant sunset.

	THE CAR

	The three men are driving through the heat of the day. Everett 
	drives; Pete is slouched in the front passenger seat; Delmar, 
	in back, picks out 'I'll Fly Away' on a banjo.

	Pete listens to something, squints, tilts his head.

				PETE
		...Shutup, Delmar.

	Delmar and Everett exchange glances; Everett shrugs and Delmar 
	desists.

	We can faintly hear a high, unearthly singing. Barely human, 
	the sound seems to agitate Pete. He looks desperately out 
	the window.

	His hinging point-of-view shows, down the declivity from the 
	road and half hidden by trees, three women washing clothes 
	in the river.

	Pete's reaction is enormous. He jams a fist into his mouth, 
	eyes widening. He yanks the fist out and screams:

				PETE
		PULL OVER!

	Everett, startled, does so.

	EXT.

	Before the car has even come to a stop Pete's door flies 
	open and he is stumbling down the bank to the river.

	Everett and Delmar follow more casually, Everett chuckling.

				EVERETT
		I guess o' Pete's got the itch.

	AT THE RIVER

	The unearthly singing, full volume here, comes from the three 
	women, beautiful but marked by an otherworldly langor as 
	they dunk clothes in the stream and beat them against rocks.

	Pete is all awkward smiles and deep, burning eyes:

				PETE
		Howdy do, ladies. Name of Pete!

	Strangely, the three laundresses do not answer, though they 
	do smile at him as they continue to sing.

	Pete tries again as he reaches into their laundry basket:

				PETE
		Maybe I could help you with the, uh-

	He realizes he is holding ladies' undergarments.

				PETE
		Ahem. I, uh...

	He drops them back in the basket.

				PETE
		I don't believe I've, uh, heard that 
		song before...

	Everett and Delmar have arrived; Everett is loud and jovial:

				EVERETT
		Aintcha gonna innerduce us, Pete?

	Pete's eyes stay glued on the women as he hisses out of the 
	corner of his mouth:

				PETE
		Don't know their names. I seen 'em 
		first!

	Everett laughs lightly.

				EVERETT
		Ladies, you'll have to pardon my 
		friend here; Pete is dirt-ignorant 
		and unschooled in the social arts. 
		My name on the other hand is Ulysses 
		Everett McGill and you ladies are 
		about the three prettiest water lilies 
		it's ever been my privilege to admire.

	None of the women respond but, as all continue to sing, one 
	brings a jug marked with three Xes to Everett.

				EVERETT
		Why, thank you dear, that's very, 
		uh...

	He takes a swig.

				EVERETTE
		Mm. Corn licker, I guess, uh, the 
		preferred local uh...

	He passes the jug to Pete as the woman runs her fingers 
	through his hair.

	The other two women are approaching to likewise tousle Pete 
	and Delmar.

	Delmar's woman caresses his face and, by squeezing his cheeks, 
	smushes his mouth into a pucker.

				DELMAR
		Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

	The singing continues. The stream gurgles. Somewhere, in the 
	distance, flies lazily buzz.

				PETE
		Damn!

								FADE OUT

								 FADE IN

	CLOSE ON DELMAR

	We are very tight. Delmar's eyes are closed. We hear loud 
	snoring. At length his eyelids flutter open, but the snoring 
	continues.

	Delmar groggily props himself on one elbow.

	It is late afternoon. He is still on the riverbank. Everett 
	snores nearby.

	The ladies are gone. The hamper of laundry is gone. Pete is 
	gone.

	After looking blearily about for a moment, Delmar starts and 
	staggers to his feet.

				DELMAR
		Holy Saint Christopher!

	He toes Everett urgently in the ribs.

				EVERETT
		Whuhh...

				DELMAR
		Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

	Pete's clothes are laid out on the ground, not in a heap, 
	but mimicking the human shape, as if he had been simply 
	vaporized fron within them.

	Everett rouses himself and looks at the clothes: He scans 
	the opposite river bank.

				EVERETT
		PETE! Where the heck are ya! We ain't 
		got time for your shenanigans!

	Delmar stares horrified at the pile of clothes: a spot in 
	the middle of the shirt is rising and falling, rising and 
	falling.

				DELMAR
		Sweet Jesus, Everett! They left his 
		heart!

	Everett joins Delmar to look. The rhythmic rising and falling 
	now travels up the shirt. A large yellow toad sticks its 
	head out from under the collar.

	Delmar keens. Everett is bewildered.

				EVERETT
		What on earth is goin' on here! What's 
		got into you, Delmar!

				DELMAR
		Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh-
		reens did this to Pete! They loved 
		him up an' turned him into a horney-
		toad!

	The toad hops down the river bank.

				DELMAR
		Pete! Come back!

	He slides down the bank after the toad, Everett watching in 
	perturbation.

	The toad plops into the river and Delmar dives in after him. 
	He emerges a moment later with the toad wriggling in his 
	hand.

				DELMAR
		Don't worry, Pete! It's me, Delmar! 
		Oh Everett! What're we gonna do?!

	DRIVING

	We hear soft whimpering as Everett drives, sneaking worried 
	glances over at the passenger seat.

	Delmar has the toad in his lap. He whimpers as he pets it.

	Everett hesitantly offers:

				EVERETT
		...I'm not sure that's Pete.

				DELMAR
		Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

	The frog croaks.

				DELMAR
		We gotta find some kinda wizard can 
		change 'im back!

	A beat. Delmar continues to whimper.

	Everett squints and shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		...I'm just not sure that's Pete.

	FINE RESTAURANT

	The tables are formally laid with linen. Delmar and Everett 
	sit at a table, a shoebox between them, deep in conversation.

				EVERETT
		You can't display a toad in a fine 
		restaurant like this! Why, the good 
		folks here'd go right off their feed!

				DELMAR
		I just don't think it's right, keepin' 
		him under wraps like we's ashamed of 
		him.

				EVERETT
		Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of 
		him.  The way I see it he got what 
		he deserved - fornicating with some 
		whore a Babylon.  These things-

	He points a knife at the shoebox.

				EVERETT
		-don't happen for no reason, Delmar.
		Obviously it's some kind of judgment 
		on Pete's character.

	ANOTHER PATRON

	We are looking over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man 
	in a cream-colored suit and a shirt with powder-blue collar. 
	He is digging into a huge plateful of steak and eggs. Sensing 
	something, he looks up, cocks his head, and then slowly turns 
	to look back.

	He thus reveals a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue 
	trim; his good eye is looking intently off - at Everett and 
	Delmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	Still heatedly discussing.

				DELMAR
		The two of us was fixing to fornicate!

	The waitress has just arrived for their order. Everett gives 
	her an ingratiating laugh:

				EVERETT
		Heh-heh. You'll have to excuse my 
		rusticated friend here, unaccustomed 
		as he is to city manners.

	He ostentatiously fans some of his money.

				EVERETT
		Well mamzel I guess we'll have a 
		couple a steaks and some gratinated 
		potatoes and wash it down with your 
		finest bubbly wine-

	BIG MAN

	Watching Everett fan his money. The big man stops chewing 
	and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty 
	pat.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	As Everett closes his menu.

				EVERETT
		...And I don't suppose the chef'd 
		have any nits or grubs in the pantry, 
		or - naw, never mind, just bring me 
		a couple leafs a raw cabbage.

				WAITRESS
		Yes sir.

	The big man appears as she leaves.

				BIG MAN
		Don't believe I've seen you boys 
		around here before! Allow me 
		t'innerduce myself: name of Daniel 
		Teague, known in these precincts as 
		Big Dan Teague or, to those who're 
		pressed for time, Big Dan toot court.

				EVERETT
		How d'you do, Big Dan. I'm Ulysses 
		Everett McGill; this is my associate 
		Delmar O'Donnell.  I sense that, 
		like me, you are endowed with the 
		gift of gab.

	Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair.

				BIG DAN
		I flatter myself that such is the 
		case; in my line of work it's plumb 
		necessary. The one thing you don't 
		want is air in the conversation.

				EVERETT
		Once again we find ourselves in 
		agreement.  What kind of work do you 
		do, Big Dan?

				BIG DAN
		Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what 
		do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed 
		word of it, from Genesee on down to 
		Revelations! That's right, the word 
		of God, which let me add there is 
		damn good money in during these days 
		of woe and want! Folks're lookin' 
		for answers and Big Dan Teague sells 
		the only book that's got 'em! What 
		do you do - you and your tongue-tied 
		friend?

				DELMAR
		Uh, we uh-

				EVERETT
		We're adventurers, sir, currently 
		pursuin' a certain opportunity but 
		open to others as well.

				BIG DAN
		I like your style, young man, so I'm 
		gonna propose you a proposition. You 
		cover my check so I don't have to 
		run back up to my room, have your 
		waitress wrap your dinner picnic-
		style, and we'll retire to more 
		private environs where I will explain 
		to you how vast amounts of money can 
		be made in the service of God Amighty.

	Everett rises and digs in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		Well, why not. If nothing else I 
		could use some civilized conversation.

	As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a 
	tilt of the head and a crinkling smile.

				BIG DAN
		Don't forget your shoebox, friend.

	We hear bellowing issuing from a curtained private dining-
	room.

	INSIDE THE PRIVATE ROOM

	Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of 
	whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue.

				PAPPY
		Languishing! Goddamn campaign is 
		languishing! We need a shot inna 
		arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn 
		ARM!  Election held tomorra, that 
		sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a 
		walk!

				JUNIOR
		Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

	Pappy narrows his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting 
	at.

				PAPPY
		...Yeah?

				JUNIOR
		Well people like that reform. Maybe 
		we should get us some.

	Pappy whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it.

				PAPPY
		I'll reform you, you soft-headed 
		sonofabitch! How we gonna run reform 
		when we're the damn incumbent!

	He glares around the table.

				PAPPY
		Zat the best idea any you boys can 
		come up with? REEform?! Weepin' Jesus 
		on the cross! Eckard, you may as 
		well start draftin' my concession 
		speech right now.

	Eckard grunts as he starts to rise.

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	Pappy whips him back down with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'm just makin' a point, you stupid 
		sonofabitch!

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	As he settles back Eckard looks around the table and helpfully 
	relays:

				ECKARD
		Pappy just makin' a point here, boys.

	A MEADOW

	The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off 
	the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with 
	bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak.

	Everett, Delmar and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large 
	picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of 
	chicken off a bone.

	He tosses the bone over his shoulder, belches, and sighs.

				BIG DAN
		Thankee boys for throwin' in that 
		fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite 
		and even with lunch under my belt I 
		was feeling a mite peckish.

				EVERETT
		Our pleasure, Big Dan.

				BIG DAN
		And thank you as well for that 
		conversational hiatus; I generally 
		refrain from speech while engaged in 
		gustation. There are those who attempt 
		both at the same time but I find it 
		course and vulgar. Now where were 
		we?

				DELMAR
		Makin' money in the Lord's service.

				BIG DAN
		You don't say much friend, but when 
		you do it's to the point and I salute 
		you for it.

	Delmar is pleased and embarrassed.

				DELMAR
		Oh, it weren't nothin', I-

				BIG DAN
		Yes, Bible sales. The trade is not a 
		complicated one; there're but two 
		things to learn. One bein' where to 
		find your wholesaler - word of God 
		in bulk as it were. Two bein' how to 
		reckanize your customer - who're you 
		dealin' with? - an exercise in 
		psychology so to speak.

	He rises to his feet and tosses down his napkin.

				BIG DAN
		And it is that which I propose to 
		give you a lesson in right now.

	He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off 
	a tree. He casually strips its twigs.

				EVERETT
		I like to think that I'm a pretty 
		astute observer of the human scene.

				BIG DAN
		No doubt, brother - I figured as 
		much back there in the restaurant. 
		That's why I invited you out here 
		for this advanced tutorial.

	His club is ready. He swings at Delmar who staggers back 
	with a grunt.

	Everett wears a puzzled smile.

				EVERETT
		...What's goin' on, Big Dan?

	Delmar, though stunned, is faster to size things up. He 
	charges Big Dan and wraps his arms around him.

	Delmar roars.

	Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head.

	Everett is still puzzled, but willing to be instructed:

				EVERETT
		Big Dan, what're you doin'?

	Big Dan walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still 
	attached to him like a hunting dog locked on to a bear. Big 
	Dan takes a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow 
	to Everett.

	The blow catches Everett on the chin and sends him reeling.

				BIG DAN
		It's all about money, boys! Atsy 
		answer! Dough re mi!

	Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away. He whacks 
	Everett into a semi-conscious heap and then paws through his 
	pockets.

				BIG DAN
		Do unto others before they do unto 
		you!

	He pulls out their wad of cash.

				BIG DAN
		I'll just take your show cards...

	He walks over to Delmar who is on the ground moaning, and 
	kicks him several times.

				BIG DAN
		...and whatever you got in the hole.

	He takes Delmar's shoebox and flips off the top.

	Inside is a bed of straw with the toad resting on it.

				BIG DAN
		What the...

	He pokes around the straw with his finger; nothing else 
	inside.

				BIG DAN
		It's nothin' but a damn toad!

	Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes.

	Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist.

	Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips:

				DELMAR
		No... you don't understand...

				BIG DAN
		Don't you boys know these things 
		give ya warts?

	He squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against 
	a tree.

				DELMAR
		Oh Lord... Pete...

	Big Dan is over at the car, cranking it up.

				BIG DAN
		End of lesson.

	He climbs in.

				BIG DAN
		So long, boys! Hee-hee! See ya in 
		the funny papers!

	The car belches and pops and toodles off down the road.

	Delmar staggers to his feet and stumbles over to the carcass 
	of the frog, weeping.

				DELMAR
		Pete... Pete... Pete...

								FADE OUT

	PAN DOWN FROM BLACK TO BRING IN A TORCH

	Flickering in the night. We hear the rumble of distant thunder 
	as the continued pan down brings the torch's bearer into 
	frame - a man with the slavering grin of the dim-witted 
	sadist. He watches as we hear:

				VOICE
		Where are they?!

	There is the sound of a lash and a scream.

				VOICE
		Talk, you unreconstructed whelp of a 
		whore! Where they headed?

	Another lash brings another scream.

	The screams come from Pete. His arms, stretched high over 
	his head, are tied to a tree limb. His interrogator wields a 
	bullwhip.

				INTERROGATOR
		Your screams ain't gonna save your 
		flesh! Only your tongue is, boy!

	Another lash, another scream.

				INTERROGATOR
		Where they headed!

	A third man walks into the torchlight, a hound drooling at 
	his heels. He is Cooley, the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses 
	whom we remember from previous barn confrontations.

				COOLEY
		Lump. I.O.

	The two men acknowledge by backing away from Pete.

	We hear a pat... pat... and then the accelerating pitter-
	patter of arriving rain.

	Cooley looks up.

				COOLEY
		Sweet summer rain. Like God's own 
		mercy.

	He looks back down at Pete.

				COOLEY
		Your two friends have abandoned you, 
		Pete.  They don't seem to care 'bout 
		your hide.

	He shrugs, looks off.

				COOLEY
		...Okay.

	Looking up, into black: a rope is tossed up - it recedes out 
	of the torchlight into black night - and then drops back 
	down into the light, a noose bouncing at its end.

				COOLEY
		Stairway to heaven, Pete.

	The two henchmen fit the noose over Pete's neck. Cooley licks 
	his lips. His dog slobbers.

				COOLEY
		We shall all meet, by and by.

				PETE
		Goddamnit!

	Cooley holds up one hand. The two men pause in fitting the 
	noose.

	Pete is sobbing:

				PETE
		Godfer gimme!

	Thunder crashes.

	BACK OF A HAYTRUCK

	Everett and Delmar sit disconsolately on a haybale as the 
	stakebed truck bounces along a rough country road. They are 
	both ill-kempt and heavily bruised.

	Though still an undammable river of verbiage, Everett now 
	seems to be talking out of weary habit, not conviction:

				EVERETT
		Believe me, Delmar, he would've wanted 
		us to press on. Pete, rest his soul, 
		was one sour-assed sonofabitch and 
		not given to acts of pointless 
		sentimentality.

	Delmar doggedly shakes his head.

				DELMAR
		It just don't seem right, diggin' up 
		that treasure without him.

	We distantly hear picks ringing and male chanting. Hollow-
	eyed, Everett tries to convince himself as much as Delmar:

				EVERETT
		Maybe it's for the best that Pete 
		was squushed. Why, he was barely a 
		sentient bein'. Now, soon as we clean 
		ourselves up, get a little smell'um 
		in our hair, we're just gonna feel a 
		hunnert per cent better about 
		ourselves and about...

	His voice trails away as he looks out at the road.

	They are passing a line of chained men in prison stripes and 
	duck-billed caps wielding pickaxes and shovels at the side 
	of the road. Guards bearing shotguns amble back and forth.

	As he stares at the line of men Everett tries to pick up his 
	thread:

				EVERETT
		...and about... life in general...

	The prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust.

				EVERETT
		Jesus. We must be near Parchman Farm.

	The men, giving throat to a dolorous chain-gang chant, do 
	not look up at the passing haytruck.

	Everett is haunted:

				EVERETT
		Sorry sonsabitches... Seems like a 
		year ago we bust off the farm...

	The last man in line swings his pick and, as he grows smaller, 
	looks up. Everett stares.

	It is Pete.

	Lone and lorn, he returns Everett's slack-jawed stare until 
	heat ripples and the truck's dusty wake dissolve him away.

	Everett blinks.

				EVERETT
		Pete have a brother?

				DELMAR
		Not that I'm aware.

	Everett shakes his head as if to clear it.

				EVERETT
		Heat must be gettin' to me.

	The truck rattles on.

	TOWN SQUARE

	Ithaca, Mississippi. On a bunting-covered stage a pencil-
	necked man with round rimless glasses addresses a crowd of 
	rustics.

	The pencil-neck is identified on posters as 'Homer Stokes, 
	Friend of the Little Man', and, in life as in the pictures, 
	he shakes a broom over his head. A midget in overalls stands 
	next to him.

				STOKES
		And I say to you that the great state 
		a Mississippi cannot afford four 
		more years a Pappy O'Daniel - four 
		more years a cronyism, nepotism, 
		rascalism and service to the 
		Innarests!  The choice, she's a clear 
		'un: Pappy O'Daniel, slave a the 
		Innarests; Homer Stokes, servant a 
		the little man! Ain't that right, 
		little fella?

	The midget enthusiastically seconds:

				MIDGET
		He ain't lyin'!

				STOKES
		When the litle man says jump, Homer 
		Stokes says how high? And, ladies'n 
		jettymens, the little man has 
		admonished me to grasp the broom a -
		ree-form and sweep this state clean!

	The midget waves his little midget broom in time with Stoke's 
	waves.

				STOKES
		It's gonna be back to the flour mill, 
		Pappy! The Innarests can take care a 
		theyselves! Come Tuesday, we gonna 
		sweep the rascals out! Clean gummint - 
		yours for the askin'!

	He beams amid cheers and then, as three girls in gingham 
	frocks run out to join him:

				STOKES
		An' now - the little Wharvey gals!  
		Whatcha got for us, darlin's?

	The oldest girl is about ten.

				LITTLE GIRL
		'In the Highways'!

				STOKES
		That's fine.

	The haytruck has pulled into the square and Everett and Delmar 
	are climbing out.

	Everett stares at the stage.

				EVERETT
		Wharvey gals?! Did he just say the 
		little Wharvey gals?

	Delmar shrugs. For some reason, Everett is enraged:

				EVERETT
		Goddamnit all!

	Onstage, the three girls are singing in untrained but 
	enthusiastic harmony:

				GIRLS
		In the highways, In the hedges...

	Everett stomps toward the stage, fighting his way through 
	the crowd. Puzzled, Delmar follows.

				DELMAR
		You know them gals, Everett?

	Everett reaches the stage and climbs up into the wings just 
	as the song ends. The midget starts buck-dancing to a fiddle 
	tune as the three little girls, filing off, notice Everett.

				YOUNGEST
		Daddy!

				MIDDLE
		He ain't our daddy!

				EVERETT
		Hell I ain't! Whatsis 'Wharvey' gals? - 
		Your name's McGill!

				YOUNGEST
		No sir! Not since you got hit by a 
		train!

				EVERETT
		What're you talkin' about - I wasn't 
		hit by a train!

				MIDDLE
		Mama said you was hit by a train!

				YOUNGEST
		Blooey!

				OLDEST
		Nothin' left!

				MIDDLE
		Just a grease spot on the L&N!

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I never been hit by any train!

				OLDEST
		At's right! So Mama's got us back to 
		Wharvey!

				MIDDLE
		That's a maiden name.

				YOUNGEST
		You got a maiden name, Daddy?

				EVERETT
		No, Daddy ain't got a maiden name; 
		ya see -

				MIDDLE
		That's your misfortune!

				YOUNGEST
		At's right! And now Mama's got a new 
		beau!

				OLDEST
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Yeah, I know 'bout that.

				MIDDLE
		Mama says he's bona fide!

	This worries Everett:

				EVERETT
		Hm. He give her a ring?

				YOUNGEST
		Yassir, big'un!

				MIDDLE
		Gotta gem!

				OLDEST
		Mama checked it!

				YOUNGEST
		It's bona fide!

				MIDDLE
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Hm. What's his name?

				MIDDLE
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				YOUNGEST
		Uncle Vernon.

				OLDEST
		Till tomorrow.

				YOUNGEST
		Then he's gonna be Daddy!

				EVERETT
		I'm the only damn daddy you got! I'm 
		the damn paterfamilias!

				OLDEST
		Yeah, but you ain't bona fide!

				EVERETT
		Hm. Where's your mama?

	Stokes is announcing from the stage:

				STOKES
		And now let's fetch back the Wharvey 
		gals to sing 'I'll Fly Away'.

	The girls call over their shoulders as they run back onstage:

				MIDDLE
		She's at the five and dime.

				YOUNGEST
		Buyin' nipples!

	WOOLWORTH'S

	The faces of a six-year-old girl and her four-year-old sister 
	light up.

				GIRLS
		Daddy!

	Next to them is a two-year-old girl with a string wrapped 
	around her waist. The other end of the string is held by a 
	woman in her thirties with a haggard, careworn face. The 
	woman also holds a babe-in-arms.

	Everett, entering, goggles at the infant.

				EVERETT
		Who the hell is that?!

				WOMAN
		Starla Wharvey.

				EVERETT
		Starla McGill you mean! How come you 
		never told me about her?

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		'Cause you was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		And that's another thing - why're 
		you tellin' our gals I was hit by a 
		train!

				WOMAN
		Lotta respectable people been hit by 
		trains. Judge Hobby over in Cookeville 
		was hit by a train. What was I 
		supposed to tell 'em - that you was 
		sent to the penal farm and I divorced 
		you from shame?

				EVERETT
		Well - I take your point. But it 
		leaves me in a damned awkward position 
		vis-a-vis my progeny.

	A man in a straw boater joins them.

				BOATER
		'Lo Penny... This gentleman bothering 
		you?

				EVERETT
		You Waldrip?

				BOATER
		That's right.

	Everett sniffs and, catching a scent, squints.

	Waldrip's hair, protruding from under his boater, is plastered 
	against his scalp.

				EVERETT
		...Have you been using my hair 
		treatment?

				WALDRIP
		Your hair treatment?!

	Everett covers his anger with an exaggerated politeness.

				EVERETT
		S'cuse me...

	He draws Penny aside.

				EVERETT
		Well, I got news for you case you 
		hadn't noticed - I wasn't hit by a 
		train. And I've traveled many a weary 
		mile to be back with my wife and six 
		daughters.

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		Seven, Daddy!

				PENNY
		That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. 
		Your daddy was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		Now Penny, stop that!

				PENNY
		No - you stop it! Vernon here's got 
		a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's 
		bona fide! What're you?

				EVERETT
		I'll tell you what I am - I'm the 
		paterfamilias! You can't marry him!

				PENNY
		I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! 
		I gotta think about the little Wharvey 
		gals! They look to me for answers! 
		Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em 
		lessons on the clarinet! The only 
		good thing you ever did for the gals 
		was get his by that train!

				EVERETT
		...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... 
		succubus!

				WALDRIP
		You can't swear at my fiancee!

				EVERETT
		Oh yeah? Well you can't marry my 
		wife!

	With this he takes a wild swing which Waldrip easily eludes.   
	Waldrip adapts a Marquess of Queensbury stance and prances 
	about, delivering stinging punches to the nose of a stunned 
	and outclassed Everett.

	A crowd is gathering and voices murmur:

				BYSTANDERS
		Who is that man?

				PENNY
		He's not my husband. Just a drifter, 
		I guess... Just some no-account 
		drifter...

	EXT. WOOLWORTH'S

	Its glass doors swing open and Everett is hurled out and 
	bellyflops into the dust of the street.

				BRAWNY MANAGER
		...And stay out of Woolworth's!

	MOVIE THEATER

	Romantic music tinnily plays as Delmar and Everett watch, 
	Everett slumped down and angrily hissing:

				EVERETT
		Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! 
		Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember 
		that one simple precept and your 
		time with me will not have been ill 
		spent!

				DELMAR
		Okay, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' 
		to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the 
		subjective!  You ever been with a 
		woman?

				DELMAR
		Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family 
		farm back before I can start thinkin' 
		about that.

				EVERETT
		Well that's right! If then! Believe 
		me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish 
		instrument of torture ever devised 
		to bedevil the days a man!

				DELMAR
		Everett, I never figured you for a 
		paterfamilias.

				EVERETT
		Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. 
		And you see what it, uh... what it's 
		earned me... Now what in the...

	The screen is flickering down to black as the music slows to 
	sludge and stops.

	The theater is dark and quiet.

	Everett and Delmar, and the rest of the sparse audience, 
	look restively about.

	A man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium.

	He walks halfway down the aisle and stops several rows behind 
	Delmar and Everett. He scans the theater, then brings a 
	whistle to his lips.

	At his whistle the back doors burst open and a line of chained 
	men trot in at double-time. With much clanking they file 
	into one row and then, that row filled, the one behind it. 
	They remain silently on their feet.

	The first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts 
	scan the theater. The first guard again blows his whistle.

	The two rows of chained men sit.

	After another silence:

				FIRST GUARD
		...Okay boys! Enjoy yer pickcha show!

	One more whistle cues the movie to grind back up to speed.

	A hissing whisper from behind draws Everett and Delmar's 
	attention:

				VOICE
		Do not seek the treasure! It's a 
		bushwhack!

	Everett and Delmar turn and stare, saucer-eyed. In the middle 
	of the frontmost row of convicts sits Pete - bald, haunted 
	Pete.

	After a long, disbelieving stare:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

	Pete whispers again, urgently:

				PETE
		They're fixin' a ambush! Do not seek 
		the treasure!

	Everett, jaw hanging open, can only stare, as if at a ghost. 
	Delmar stares also, but finally brings out another:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

				PETE
		Do not seek the treasure!

	Everett's face remains frozen in horrified disbelief, but 
	Delmar finally accepts Pete's corporeal reality.

				DELMAR
		We thought you was a toad!

	Pete squints and cocks his head as if to say, What was that?

	Delmar repeats the whisper slowly and with exaggerated mouth 
	movements:

				DELMAR
		We thought... you was... a toad!

	Pete shakes his head - didn't catch it - and repeats, also 
	overarticulating:

				PETE
		Do not... seek... the treasure!

	A guard murmurs:

				GUARD
		Quiet there. Watcha pickcha.

	VERANDA

	Pappy O'Daniel sits on the veranda of the Governor's Mansion, 
	smoking a cigar and sipping from a glass of bourbon as the 
	evening sun goes down.

				PAPPY
		I signed that bill! I signed a dozen 
		a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone 
		knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! 
		What do I gotta do, start diddlin' 
		livestock?!

				JUNIOR
		We cain't do that, Daddy, we might 
		offend our constichency.

				PAPPY
		We ain't got a constichency! Stokes 
		got a constichency!

				ECKARD
		Them straw polls is ugly.

				SPIVEY
		Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.

				ECKARD
		Gonna pluck us off the tit.

				SPIVEY
		Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants 
		down and Stokes at the table soppin' 
		up the gravy.

				ECKARD
		Latch right on to that tit.

				SPIVEY
		Wipin' little circles with his bread.

				ECKARD
		Suckin' away.

				SPIVEY
		Well, it's a well-run campaign, 
		midget'n broom'n whatnot.

				ECKARD
		Devil his due.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva awgazation.

				JUNIOR
		Say, I gotten idee.

				ECKARD
		What sat, Junior?

				JUNIOR
		We could hire us a little fella even 
		smaller'n Stokes's.

	Pappy whips at him with his hat.

				PAPPY
		Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a 
		guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha 
		satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies 
		braggin' on our own midget! Don't 
		matter how stumpy! And that's the 
		goddamn problem right there - people 
		think this Stokes got fresh ideas, 
		he's oh coorant and we the past.

				ECKARD
		Problem a p'seption.

				SPIVEY
		Ass right.

				ECKARD
		Reason why he's pullin' ah pants 
		down.

				SPIVEY
		Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.

				ECKARD
		Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna 
		kick it real hard.

	With his mouth forming an O around his dropping cigar, Pappy 
	looks sadly from one to the other, like a spectator at a 
	particularly boring tennis match.

				SPIVEY
		No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle 
		it.

				ECKARD
		Well now, I don't believe assa 
		property scription.

				SPIVEY
		Well, that's how I characterize it.

				ECKARD
		Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' 
		sichation.

				SPIVEY
		Pullin' ah pants down...

				ECKARD
		Wipin' little circles with his 
		bread...

	A NOOSE

	In slow motion it is dropping... dropping... dropping through 
	the night. We hear distant thunder and the howl of a hound. 
	The sounds recede, and the black background dissolves into a 
	pan down from a raftered ceiling as the noose fades away.

	The continued pan down shows that we are in a barracks-like 
	cabin. It is night. Convicts are ranged in bunk-beds. Their 
	snores stand out against the chirp of crickets.

	In the upper berth of the foreground bed is Pete. His hands 
	are clasped behind his head. A manacle and chain links one 
	wrist to a rail that serves as headboard.

	He stares up, haunted, at the phantom noose.

				PETE
		I could not gaze upon that far 
		shore...

	He reacts quizically to a whispered:

				VOICE
		Pete!

	A moment later Everett rises over the lip of his bed. His 
	face is blacked and he sways as if standing on a boat.

				EVERETT
		Hold still.

	He is raising a large, long-armed, short-nosed pincering 
	tool. He locks the nose onto Pete's chain and levers the 
	arms. As his hand chinks free, Pete does not react to his 
	newfound liberty.

	We hear an agonized voice from off as Everett continues to 
	sway:

				DELMAR
		...Cain't stand much longer.

	Pete's eyes burn into Everett's.

				PETE
		It was a moment a weakness!

				EVERETT
		Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to 
		skedaddle.

	THE THREE MEN

	We track with them as they walk through the moonlit woods. 
	Delmar's and Everett's faces are thoroughly blacked; Pete is 
	just finishing blacking his, and he hands the shoe polish 
	back to Everett.

				PETE
		They lured me out for a bathe, then 
		they dunked me'n trussed me up like 
		a hog and turned me in for the bounty.

				EVERETT
		I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly 
		behavior. Just lucky we left before 
		they came for us.

				DELMAR
		We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just 
		thought you was a toad.

				PETE
		No, they never did turn me into a 
		toad.

				DELMAR
		Well that was our mistake then. And 
		then we was beat up by a bible 
		salesman and banished from 
		Woolworth's. I don't know if it's 
		the one branch or all of 'em.

				PETE
		Well I - I ain't had it easy either, 
		boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled 
		my guts about the treasure.

				DELMAR
		Huh?!

				PETE
		Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; 
		must be my Hogwallop blood.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right, Pete.

	Pete is shaking his head, miserable.

				PETE
		It's awful white of ya to take it 
		like that, Everett. I feel wretched, 
		spoilin' yer play for a million 
		dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' 
		at my guts.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right.

	Pete starts weeping.

				PETE
		You boys're true friends!

	He hugs a stunned Delmar.

				PETE
		You're m'boon companions!

	He hugs Everett, who looks profoundly uncomfortable.

				EVERETT
		Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat 
		yourself up about this thing...

				PETE
		I cain't help it, but that's a 
		wonderful thing to say!

				EVERETT
		Well, but Pete...

	He clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Uh, the fact of the matter is - well, 
		damnit, there ain't no treasure!

	Now it is Pete's turn to be stunned. He and Delmar stare at 
	Everett.

				EVERETT
		Fact of the matter - there never 
		was!

				PETE
		But... but...

				DELMAR
		So - where's all the money from your 
		armored-car job?

				EVERETT
		I never knocked over any armored-
		car. I was sent up for practicing 
		law without a license.

				PETE
		But...

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My 
		wife wrote me she was gettin' married! 
		I gotta stop it!

	Pete stares vacantly off.

				PETE
		...No treasure... I had two weeks 
		left on my sentence...

				EVERETT
		I couldn't wait two weeks! She's 
		gettin' married tomorra!

				PETE
		...With my added time for the escape, 
		I don't get out now 'til 1987... 
		I'll be eighty-four years old.

	Delmar, not angry himself, is trying to work it out.

				DELMAR
		Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty 
		years for me too.

				EVERETT
		Boys, we was chained together. I 
		hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out 
		alone was not a option!

				PETE
		...Eighty-four years old.

	Delmar brightens.

				DELMAR
		I'll only be eighty-two.

	Pete lunges at Everett.

				PETE
		YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

	He tackles him and, with his hands wrapped round Everett's 
	throat, the two roll over.

				EVERETT
			(strangled)
		Pete... I do apologize.

				PETE
		Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' 
		pab-you-lum!

	They have rolled through some brush and their bodies are now 
	halfway into a clearing. They abruptly stop.

	Pete, lying on top of Everett, looks up, startled by loud 
	chanting. Everett, lying on his back, tries to see as well, 
	his eyes rolling back in his head.

	Their point-of-view shows a great open field where men in 
	bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross.

	Pete and Everett hastily crabwalk back into the bushes and 
	then push through with Delmar.

	The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, 
	intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At 
	length they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to 
	face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning 
	cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold.

	An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the 
	burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The 
	backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from 
	the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett.

	As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, 
	whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet.

				BLACK MAN
		I ain't never harmed any you 
		gentlemen!

	Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		It's Tommy! They got Tommy!

				DELMAR
		Oh my God!

	It is indeed Tommy Johnson.

				TOMMY
		I ain't never harmed nobody!

	Pete is staring aghast at the makeshift gibbet.

				PETE
		The noose. Sweet Jesus! We gotta 
		save 'im!

	A broad-shouldered man in the middle of the ranks of Klansmen, 
	sensing something, slowly turns to look back over his 
	shoulder. He thus reveals that his hood has only one eye-
	hole.

	He slowly draws off his hood. It is, of course, Big Dan 
	Teague. His one good eye looks about; his other eye, now 
	revealed, is hideously clouded and stares up and off in fixed 
	sightlessness.

	Everett, still crouched behind the bushes, notices something. 
	He hisses and points.

				EVERETT
		The color guard.

	Off to one side is a robed and hooded three-man color guard 
	displaying a Confederate flag.

	In front of the crowd the Imperial Wizard raises one satin-
	draped arm, and the chanting stops.

				WIZARD
		Brothers! We are foregathered here 
		to preserve our hallowed culture'n 
		heritage!  From intrusions, inclusions 
		and dilutions!  Of culluh! Of creed! 
		Of our ol'-time religion!

	Over in the bushes Everett, Delmar and Pete are straightening 
	up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having 
	disposed of the color guard.

				WIZARD
		We aim to pull evil up by the root! 
		Before it chokes out the flower of 
		our culture'n heritage! And our women! 
		Let's not forget those ladies, y'all, 
		lookin' to us for p'tection! From 
		darkies! From Jews! From Papists! 
		And from all those smart-ass folk 
		say we come descended from the 
		monkeys!  That's not my culture'n 
		heritage!

	A roar from the crowd.

				WIZARD
		Izzat your culture'n heritage?

	Another roar.

				WIZARD
		And so... we gonna hang us a neegra!

	A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting.

	The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the 
	two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy! It's us!

	Behind Everett in the deep background someone emerges from 
	the ranks into the middle aisle. He approaches with a strong, 
	purposeful stride - Big Dan Teague, bareheaded, holding his 
	hood under his arm.

	Everett hisses again:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy!

	Tommy looks back over his shoulder.

				TOMMY
		...Huh?

	Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind.

				EVERETT
		It's us! We come to rescue ya!

				TOMMY
		That's mighty kind of ya boys, but I 
		don't think nothin's gonna save me 
		now - the devil's come to collect 
		his due!

				PETE
		Tommy, you don't wanna get hanged!

				TOMMY
		Naw I don't guess I do, but that's 
		the way it seems to be workin' out.

				EVERETT
		Listen to me, Tommy, I got a plan -

	Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. 
	Everett is exposed - in blackface.

	The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned.

	Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in 
	blackface.

	From the crowd:

				VOICE
		The color guard is colored!

	Big Dan roars.

	The crowd roars.

	Everett screams:

				EVERETT
		Run, boys!

	Pandemonium breaks out, and the Imperial Wizard takes off 
	his red satin hood for a better view.

	He is the reform candidate Homer Stokes. Next to him, his 
	midget also pulls of his midget hood.

	Stokes is peeved.

				STOKES
		Who made them the color guard?

	Everett, Pete, Tommy and Delmar, bearing the Confederate 
	flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating 
	the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues 
	in full cry.

	When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. 
	He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd.

	Homer Stokes is mortified.

				STOKES
		Damn! Can't let that flag touch the 
		ground!

	The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence.

	The only sound is the fluttering flag.

	Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the 
	flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend.

	We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned 
	white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague.

	His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off 
	returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging 
	distance and trajectory.

	From somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping.

	The flag flutters.

	The crowd is silent.

	Big Dan sets and...

	WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together.

	He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the 
	ground.

	The crowd cheers.

	Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers.

	From somewhere, another BOINK.

	As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades.

	His eye tracks up - up-

	CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.

	At the foot of the cross Everett snaps its last guy wire 
	with his pincers - BOINK - and the four men sprint off.

	WHOOOOSH - As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward 
	Big Dan, frozen, looking up.

	It crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates 
	Big Dan Teague.

	A PACKARD

	It is pulling up in front of a town hall from which party 
	sounds filter out.

	Pappy O'Daniel emerges from the car with his retinue - Eckard, 
	Spivey and Junior.

				PAPPY
		I'm sayin' we har this man away.

				ECKARD
		Assa good idea, Pappy.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva idea.

				ECKARD
		Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.

				SPIVEY
		Have him join us, run our campaign 
		'stead a that pencil-neck's.

				ECKARD
		Enticements a power, wealth, settera.

				SPIVEY
		No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

				ECKARD
		Oh gracious no. Not with his 
		blandishments.

				SPIVEY
		Powas p'suasion.

				PAPPY
		What's his name again?

				ECKARD
		Campaign manager? Waldrip.

				SPIVEY
		Vernon Waldrip.

				ECKARD
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				PAPPY
		Hmm... His folks from out Tuscarora?

				SPIVEY
		Tuscarora? Might be. I b'lieve they 
		is.

				ECKARD
		Not a doubt in my mind.

	Pappy is disgusted:

				PAPPY
		You don't know where his goddamn 
		folks from; you speakin' outcha 
		asshole.

				ECKARD
		Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it 
		that strong...

	As the three men make their way up the steps, Eckard's voice 
	is fading:

				ECKARD
		...but p'haps yaw right...

	In wide shot, they disappear into the building.

	A reverse shows the wide shot to have been the point-of-view 
	of Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy, who peek out from the 
	mouth of an alley. Everett hisses his intelligence:

				EVERETT
		Well, it's a invitation-only affair; 
		we'll have to sneak in through the 
		service entrance-

				PETE
		Wait a minute - who elected you leader 
		a this outfit? Since we been followin' 
		your lead we got nothin' but trouble! 
		I gotten this close to bein' strung 
		up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped 
		no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -

				DELMAR
		'N turned into a frog -

				EVERETT
		He was never turned into a frog!

	Delmar sulks:

				DELMAR
		Almost loved up though.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		So you're against me now, too!... Is 
		that how it is, boys?

	Silence. No one wants to meet Everett's eye. He is saddened.

				EVERETT
		The whole world and God Almighty... 
		and now you. Well, maybe I deserve 
		this. Boys, I... I know I've made 
		some tactical mistakes. But if you'll 
		just stick with me; I need your help. 
		And I've got a plan.  Believe me, 
		boys, we can fix this thing! I can 
		get my wife back! We can get outta 
		here!

	Headlights play; the men suck back into the alley as a car 
	passes by.

	The car tools up to the banquet hall and Homer Stokes emerges 
	with his midget. The midget tosses his balled-up white hood 
	into the car and both men shrug into their suitcoats.

	Stokes is angry:

				STOKES
		...goddamn disgrace. Made a travesty 
		of the entire evenin'...

	They too start up the stairs. Stokes's pace is brisk and the 
	midget hops awkwardly to keep up.

				STOKES
		...what I wouldn't give to get my 
		hands on those agitators. Whoever 
		heard a such behavior. Even among 
		culluds. Or mulattos, maybe - I 
		suspect some miscegenation in their 
		heritage... how else you goin' explain 
		it - usin' the Confed'it flag as a 
		missile...

	BANQUET HALL KITCHEN

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are entering through the 
	back door. The blackface has been scrubbed off but all four 
	now wear long gray beards as disguise, clumsily affixed with 
	spirit gum. Each is carrying a musical-instrument case.

	They elbow past the bustling kitchen help.

				EVERETT
		Scuse me... scuse me... we're the 
		next act...

				DELMAR
		Everett, my beard itches.

				PETE
		This is crazy. No one's ever gonna 
		believe we're a real band.

				EVERETT
		No, this is gonna work! I just gotta 
		get close enough to talk to her. 
		Takin' off with us is got a lot more 
		future in it than marrying a guy 
		named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona 
		fide. I've got the answers!

	HEAD TABLE

	Out in the banquet hall Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side 
	at the head table, surrounded by the Wharvey gals. Penny and 
	Waldrip are facing the hall with their backs to the stage as 
	the four bearded band members - Everett, Pete, Delmar and 
	Tommy - take their places.

	Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair with an arm draped 
	over his shoulder, leaning in to murmur confidentially.  
	Waldrip sits stiffly erect as he listens, frowning at a spot 
	in space.

	Suddenly Waldrip erupts:

				WALDRIP
		Well that's a improper suggestion!  
		I can't switch sides in the middle 
		of a campaign!  Especially to work 
		for a man who lacks moral fibre!

				PAPPY
		Moral fibre?!

	He waves his cane, outraged.

				PAPPY
		You pasty-faced sonofabitch, I 
		invented moral fibre!

	Up on the stage, the band has launched into a song.

				PAPPY
		Pappy O'Daniel was displayin' 
		rectitude and high-mindedness when 
		that pencil-neck you work for was 
		still messin' his drawers!

	A hissed Voice:

				VOICE
		Psst! Penny! Hey! Up here!

	As the two men continue to exchange sharp words, penny turns 
	her head to look steeply up over her shoulder.

	Everett is up onstage just behind her. As the rest of the 
	band continues to play, he is parting his beard to hiss down 
	at her:

				EVERETT
		Penny! It's me!

	Dismayed, she shakes her head and tries to unobtrusively 
	wave him away. He is undeterred:

				EVERETT
		No, Penny, listen! We're leavin' the 
		state! Pusuin' opportunities in 
		another venue! I got big plans! Not 
		minstrelsy; this-here's just a dodge - 
		I'm gonna be a dentist! I know a guy 
		who'll print me up a license! I wanna 
		be what you want me to be, honey! I 
		want you and the gals to come with 
		me!

	She shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate 
	as Everett continues pleading to her back:

				EVERETT
		They're my daughters, Penny! I'm the 
		king a this goddamn castle!

	Stokes has ambled up to the head table.

				STOKES
		What're you doin' here, Pappy? I 
		guess someone let on there was free 
		liquor, heh-heh.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, you'll be laughin' out the 
		other side your face come November.

				ECKARD
		Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.

				SPIVEY
		Not out the other side his face, 
		though.

				ECKARD
		Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -

	This byplay is interrupted by a roar from the crowd.

	The band has launched into 'Man of Constant Sorrow', 
	precipitating the huge reaction. Everett, still trying to 
	get Penny's attention, looks up, stunned at the ovation.

	Cry from the crowd:

				VOICE
		Hot damn! Itsa Soggy Bottom Boys!

	Everett and the boys, still singing, exchange bemused looks. 
	A shrug, and they lean into the song with a will.

	Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing, bringing the 
	crowd to new heights of hysteria.

				PAPPY
		Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!

				JUNIOR
		But Pappy, they's inter-grated.

				PAPPY
		Well I guess folks don't mind they's 
		integrated.

	Stokes is also staring at the band, frowning. He murmurs to 
	himself:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute...

	Everett catches Stokes' look. The two men look at each other, 
	aghast.

	Stokes raises his voice accusingly:

				STOKES
		...you's miscegenated! All you boys!  
		Miscegenated!

	Everett raises the volume of his singing. Stokes cries out:

				STOKES
		Get me a mike-a-phone!

	A mike is thrust into his hand and he bellows into it, 
	overwhelming the music, which the boys eventually abandon. 
	Stokes continues bellowing into the silence:

				STOKES
		These boys is not white! These boys 
		is not white! Hell, they ain't even 
		ol'-timey! I happen to know, ladies'n 
		gentlemen, this band a miscreants 
		here, this very evening, they 
		interfered with a lynch mob inna 
		performance of its duties!

	The crowd stares at him, stone-faced. Stokes plows on:

				STOKES
		It's true! I b'long to a certain 
		society, I don't believe I gotta 
		mention its name, heh-heh...

	Nobody joins in the laugh; Stokes slowly strangles on it.

				STOKES
		...Ahem. And these boys here trampled 
		all over our venerated observances 
		an' rich'ls!  Now this-here music is 
		over! I aim to -

	Boos start up among the crowd.

				STOKES
		I aim to hand these boys over to - 
		listen to me, folks!

	The boos are growing in volume. There are cries of 'More 
	music!' and even one 'Shut up, pencil-neck!'

				STOKES
		Listen to me! These boys desecrated 
		a fiery cross!

	More boos. Waldrip approaches and nudges the microphone away 
	to murmur confidentially in Stokes' ear. Stokes excitedly 
	retrieves the mike and struggles to be heard:

				STOKES
		And they convicts! Fugitives, folks, 
		escaped off the farm!

	This cuts no ice; the boos have become overwhelming.

				STOKES
		Folks, these boys gotta be remanded 
		the 'thorities! Criminals! And I 
		happen to have it from the highest 
		authority that that Neegra sold his 
		soul to the devil!

	He is hit by a tomato.

	The boos are deafening; the Soggy Bottom Boys, sensing 
	opportunity, launch back into the interrupted verse of 'Man 
	of Constant Sorrow'. The boos become wild cheers.

	Stokes is being pelted by foodstuffs. Shielding himself with 
	one arm, he bellows into the mike:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Is you 
		is or is you ain't my constichency?

	INT. RUSTIC CABIN

	Far up some sleepy holler. An old man in overalls and his 
	wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny 
	voice. They look at each other wordlessly, look back at the 
	crystal set.

	BACK TO BANQUET HALL

	Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks 
	apprehensively on.

				STOKES
		Is you is or is you ain't -

	A disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug; 
	Stokes continues to mouth the inaudible words.

	Pappy is considering the crowd.

				PAPPY
		Goddamn! Oppitunity knocks!

	He starts clambering up onto the stage.

	Two men advance through the clapping audience holding high 
	either end of an eight-foot rail. When they reach Stokes, 
	other audience members help load him onto the rail.

	Onstage, Pappy claps along with the audience.

	As they play, the band members fearfully eye Pappy, who 
	advances on them.

	Pappy joyfully shakes his fat ass in time to the music and 
	does a little two-step. The audience roars. The band relaxes, 
	performing with even more gusto.

	Stokes is being through the crowd on the rail, jeered at and 
	pelted with comestibles until he bangs out the exit.

	As the songs rolls into its big finish the audience roars 
	approval, and Pappy elbows in to the microphone, beaming.

				PAPPY
		That's fine, that's fine!...

	He drops one arm around Everett, the other around Delmar.

				PAPPY
		...Ladies'n gentlemens here and 
		listenin' at home, the great state 
		of Mississippi (Pappy O'Daniel, 
		Gov'nor) thanks the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys for that won-a-ful performance!

	Cheers.

				PAPPY
		Now it looks like the only man in 
		our great state who ain't a music 
		luvva, is my esteemed opponent in 
		the upcomin', Homer Stokes -

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, well, they ain't no accountin' 
		f'taste. It sounded t'me like he 
		harbored some kind a hateful grudge 
		against the Soggy Bottom Boys on 
		account a their rough'n rowdy past.

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Sounds like Homer Stokes is the kinda 
		fella gonna cast the first stone!

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Well I'm with you folks. I'm a f'give 
		and f'get Christian. And I say, well, 
		if their rambunctiousness and 
		misdemeanorin' is behind 'em - It 
		is, ain't it, boys?

	Everett hesitates, not sure where this is going.

				EVERETT
		Sure is, Governor.

				PAPPY
		Why then I say, by the par vested in 
		me, these boys is hereby pardoned!

	Loud cheers prod Pappy to another level of inspiration:

				PAPPY
		And furthermore, in the second Pappy 
		O'Daniel administration, why, these 
		boys - is gonna be my brain trust!

	Raucous cheers.

	The band beams, but Delmar leans into Everett, worried:

				DELMAR
		What sat mean exactly, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are 
		gonna be the power behind the throne 
		so to speak.

				DELMAR
		Oh, okay.

				PAPPY
		So now, without further ado, and by 
		way of endorsin' my candidacy, the 
		Soggy Bottom Boys is gonna lead us 
		all in a chorus of 'You Are My 
		Sunshine' - ain't ya, boys?

	He gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett holds for 
	a considering beat.

				EVERETT
		...Governor - that's one of our 
		favorites!

	Pappy returns a considered appraisal:

				PAPPY
		Son, you gonna go far.

	The song begins.

	LATER

	The steps of the meeting hall. People stream out of the 
	concert into the warm summer night.

	Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps 
	with Penny.

				EVERETT
		I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna 
		be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be 
		able to throw a little patronage his 
		way, get the man a job diggin' ditches 
		or rounding up stray dogs.

				DELMAR
		Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?

				PENNY
		McGill. No, the marriage'll take 
		place as planned.

				EVERETT
		Just a little change of cast. Me and 
		the little lady are gonna pick up 
		the pieces'n retie the knot, 
		mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're 
		invited, of course. Hell, you're 
		best men! Already got the rings.

	He raises Penny's left hand with his own to display their 
	wedding bands - but Penny's finger is bare.

				EVERETT
		Where's your ring, honey?

				PENNY
		I ain't worn it since our divorce 
		came through. It must still be in 
		the rolltop in the old cabin. Never 
		thought I'd need it; Vernon bought 
		one encrusted with jewels.

				EVERETT
		Hell, now's the time to buy it off 
		him cheap.

				PENNY
		We ain't gettin' married with his 
		ring!  You said you'd changed!

				EVERETT
		Aw, honey, our ring is just a old 
		pewter thing -

				PENNY
		Ain't gonna be no weddin'.

				EVERETT
		It's just a symbol, honey -

				PENNY
		No weddin'.

				DELMAR
		We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar -
		it's just -

				PENNY
		I have spoken my piece and counted 
		to three.

	She walks off.

				EVERETT
		Oh, goddamnit! She counted to three!  
		Sonofabitch! You know how far that 
		cabin is?!

	His attention, and everyone else's, is drawn by a procession 
	on the street below. A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a 
	man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being 
	escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their 
	nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation.

	Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the 
	last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar 
	cries out:

				DELMAR
		George!

	It is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his 
	heavy restraints.

				GEORGE
		'Lo, boys! Well, these little men 
		finally caught up with the criminal 
		a the century! Looks like the chair 
		for George Nelson. Yup! Gonna 
		electrify me!  I'm gonna go off like 
		a Roman candle!  Twenty thousand 
		volts chasin' the rabbit through 
		yours truly! Gonna shoot sparks out 
		the top of my head and lightning 
		from my fingertips!

	As he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder:

				GEORGE
		Yessir! Gonna suck all the power 
		right outa the state! Goddamn, boys, 
		I'm on top of the world! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go.

				DELMAR
		Looks like George is right back on 
		top again.

	BLACK

	In the black we hear snuffling, growing louder, closer, 
	slobberier.

	A crack of light. We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being 
	nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout.

	As the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed 
	with light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets, 
	several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	PINEY WOODS

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods.

				EVERETT
		Well, at least you boys'll get to 
		see the old manse - the home where I 
		spent so many happy days in the bosom 
		of my family - a refugium, if you 
		will - with a mighty oak tree out 
		front and a happy little tire swing...

	They emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them. 
	It is indeed a peaceful-looking haven with a mighty oak tree 
	in front. There is, however, no tire swing; instead, three 
	nooses hang from one stout limb.

				DELMAR
		Where's the happy little tire swing?

	Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and 
	push them forward.

	Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-
	dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough 
	pine coffin.

	The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the 
	porch, the drooling hound at his heels.

				COOLEY
		End of the road, boys. It's had its 
		twists and turns -

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		- but now it deposits you here.

	The goons are shoving them toward the tree. Three 
	gravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from 
	the three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas 
	round their necks.

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		You have eluded fate - and eluded me - 
		for the last time. Tie their hands, 
		boys.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this -

				COOLEY
		Didn't know you'd be bringin' a 
		friend.  Well, he'll have to wait 
		his turn -

				EVERETT
		Hang on there -

				COOLEY
		- and share one of your graves.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this - we just been 
		pardoned!  By the Governer himself!

				DELMAR
		It went out over the radio!

				COOLEY
		Is that right?

	The leering goons, who have been lashing the men's wrists 
	behind their backs, pause, their sadism stymied. They look 
	to Cooley for guidance.

	So too does the drooling hound.

	Silence.

	Finally:

				COOLEY
		...Too bad we don't have a radio.

	The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy 
	task.

	The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their 
	shovels. They begin to sing a slow and dirgelike 'You've Got 
	to Walk That Lonesome Valley'. Sweat glistens on them and 
	trickles down their faces like tears.

				PETE
		God have Mercy!

				TOMMY
		It ain't fittin'!

				EVERETT
		It ain't the law!

				COOLEY
		The law. Well the law is a human 
		institution.

	Cooley gives the faintest smile.

				COOLEY
		Perhaps you should take a moment for 
		your prayers.

				PETE
		Oh my God! Everett!

				DELMAR
		I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.

				PETE
		Good Lord, what do we do?

	Pete is in tears. Tommy is terrified. Delmar bows his head 
	to silently pray.

	Everett bows his head as well. He murmurs:

				EVERETT
		Oh Lord, please look down and 
		recognize us poor sinners... please 
		Lord...

	The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell.

				EVERETT
		...I just want to see my daughters 
		again.  Oh Lord, I've been separated 
		from my family for so long...

	The mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more 
	palpable than audible - the song, it seems, rising out of 
	the earth itself.

				EVERETT
		...I know I've been guilty of pride 
		and sharp dealing. I'm sorry that I 
		turned my back on you, Lord. Please 
		forgive me, and help us, Lord, and I 
		swear I'll mend my ways... For the 
		sake of my family... For Tommy's 
		sake, and Delmar's, and Pete's...

	The rumble is building.

				EVERETT
		...Let me see my daughters again. 
		Please, Lord, help us... Please help 
		us...

	The rumble erupts into a deafening roar.

	A wall of water is crashing through the hollow.

	It engulfs everything and everybody. The cabin itself is 
	ripped away; the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their 
	feet and all is noise and confusion.

	UNDERWATER

	A silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural 
	slow motion.

	Suspended around him are scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	Other objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family 
	portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a 
	frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, the wild-eyed frantically 
	paddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it.

	FURTHER DOWNHILL

	The churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly 
	created river, fast-moving but no longer violent.

	After a beat of hold on the rippling waters, the surface is 
	broken by the up-bob of a pine coffin.

	The coffin floats downstream for a beat and then Everett 
	pops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking 
	his head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish 
	freeing himself from the rope round his wrists.

	Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air.

	The men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream. 
	Dazed, they look around.

	The inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or 
	treetop poking out of the newly formed river. All is quiet 
	except for the gurgle of water.

				DELMAR
		A miracle! It was a miracle!

				EVERETT
		Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I 
		told you they was gonna flood this 
		valley.

				DELMAR
		That ain't it!

				PETE
		We prayed to God and he pitied us!

				EVERETT
		It just never fails; once again you 
		two hayseeds are showin' how much 
		you want for innalect. There's a 
		perfectly scientific explanation for 
		what just happened -

				PETE
		That ain't the tune you were singin' 
		back there at the gallows!

				EVERETT
		Well any human being will cast about 
		in a moment of stress. No, the fact 
		is, they're flooding this valley so 
		they can hydro-electric up the whole 
		durned state...

	Everett waxes smug:

				EVERETT
		Yessir, the South is gonna change.  
		Everything's gonna be put on 
		electricity and run on a payin' basis. 
		Out with the old spiritual mumbo-
		jumbo, the superstitions and the 
		backward ways. We're gonna see a 
		brave new world where they run 
		everyone a wire and hook us all up 
		to a grid. Yessir, a veritable age 
		of reason - like the one they had in 
		France - and not a moment too soon...

	His voice trails off as he notices something.

	A cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its 
	eaves. A cow has taken refuge on its roof. It stands staring 
	at Everett, who returns the stare.

	He shakes off the vision and clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Not a moment too soon. Say, there's 
		Tommy!

	Tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream, clinging to a 
	half-submerged piece of furniture.

				EVERETT
		What you ridin' there, Tommy?

	The furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current 
	and, to keep his head above water, Tommy climbs in place 
	like a hamster on a wheel. As the chest exposes its ribbed 
	upper half:

				TOMMY
		Rolltop desk...

	STREET

	Everett and Penny walk arm in arm, the seven Wharvey gals 
	behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk.

				EVERETT
		All's well that ends well, as the 
		poet says.

				PENNY
		That's right, honey.

				EVERETT
		But I don't mind telling you, I'm 
		awful pleased my adventuring days is 
		at an end...

	He fumbles in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		...Time for this old boy to enjoy 
		some repose.

				PENNY
		That's good, honey.

				EVERETT
		And you were right about that ring. 
		Any other weddin' band would not do. 
		But this-here was foreordained, honey; 
		fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya 
		have to have confidence -

	He is slipping it onto her hand.

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		- in the gods - Huh?

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		Not your...

				PENNY
		That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

				EVERETT
		You said it was in the rolltop desk!

				PENNY
		I said I thought it was in the rolltop 
		desk.

				EVERETT
		You said -

				PENNY
		Or, it might a been under the 
		mattress.

				EVERETT
		You -

				PENNY
		Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.

	Everett shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		Well, I'm sorry honey -

				PENNY
		Well, we need that ring.

				EVERETT
		Well now honey, that ring is at the 
		bottom of a pretty durned big lake.

				PENNY
		Uh-huh.

				EVERETT
		A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.

				PENNY
		I don't care if it's ninety thousand.

				EVERETT
		Yes, but honey -

				PENNY
		That wasn't my doing...

	Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two 
	are pulling forward out of frame.

				EVERETT
		Course not, honey, but...

	We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch, 
	still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we 
	can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal.

	The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of 
	string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and 
	Everett, off:

				PENNY
		I counted to three, honey.

				EVERETT
		Well sure, honey, but...

	We reach the end of the piece of string; it is wrapped around 
	the waist of the toddler, who lingers in frame. She gazes 
	down a quiet street at the edge of town that ends in an open 
	field.

				EVERETT
		...finding one little ring in the 
		middle of all that water...

	His voice, and that of the singing girls, recedes.

				EVERETT
		...that is one hell of a heroic 
		task...

	The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of 
	frame.

	A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The rhythmic 
	clack is from the hand-pumped flatcar.

	The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing 
	harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.

	THE END
"O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU"

					  By

			   Ethan Coen and Joel Coen

	BLACK

	In black, we hear a chain-gang chant, many voices together, 
	spaced around the unison strike of picks against rock. A 
	title burns in:

	O muse! 
	Sing in me, and through me tell the story 
	Of that man skilled in all the ways of contending... 
	A wanderer, harried for years on end...

	On the sound of an impact we cut to:

	A PICK

	splitting a rock.

	As the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at 
	work. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, 
	chained together, working under a brutal midday sun.

	It is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road 
	stretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily 
	patrol the line.

	The chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless.

	We slowly fade out, returning to

	BLACK

	The last of the voices fades.

	After a long beat we hear the guitar introduction to Harry 
	McClintock's 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain.'

	A WHEAT FIELD

	A road cuts across the middle background. Noonday sun beats 
	down.

	We hear the distant picks and shovels of men at work and 
	see, rising above ground level, the occasional upraised pick 
	and spade heaving dirt. Men are digging a ditch alongside 
	the road.

	After a long beat, three men pop up in the wheat field in 
	the middle foreground. They wear faded stripes and grey duck-
	billed caps. They scurry abreast toward the camera, throwing 
	an occasional glance back at the ditch-diggers. A clanking 
	sound accompanies their run. Oddly, the wheat between them 
	sweeps down as they run. After a brief sprint they drop back 
	down into the wheat.

	In the background a man enters frame left, strolling along 
	the road, wearing a khaki uniform and sunglasses, a shotgun 
	resting against one shoulder. He glances idly down into the 
	ditch and strolls on out of frame right.

	The three men rise back up from the wheat and, clanking, 
	resume their sprint.

	THREE PAIRS OF EYES

	They are topped by three cap bills, and peer out from behind 
	a blind of greenery. We hear distant whistling.

	The men are looking at a weathered barn. A young boy, 
	whistling, is heading down the road that leads away from the 
	barn, jiggling the traces of the old plough horse that leads 
	him. He turns a corner and is gone.

	BARNYARD

	The three clanking men (we can now see their leg irons) are 
	awkwardly chasing a chicken around the yard. The squawking 
	yardbird doesn't need to move much to elude the three bunched 
	men.

	COUNTRY LANE

	It curves in a gentle S into the background. It is sun-
	dappled, pretty.

	We hear clanking footsteps approaching at a trot.

	The three men enter in the foreground and trot on down the 
	lane. The leftmost has a flapping chicken tucked under one 
	arm.

	AFTERNOON CAMPFIRE

	The three men sit in a side-by-side arc around a dying fire, 
	one of them contentedly picking his teeth with a small chicken 
	bone, another wiping grease off his chin with a sleeve, the 
	third idly poking at the fire with a spit.

	Each of them, still bound by chains, clinks as he moves.

	One of them abruptly cocks his head, listening.

	The others notice his attitude and also freeze, listening.

	We hear the distant baying of hounds.

	ROLLING HILLS

	From high on a ridge we see the three chained men running 
	toward us.

	In addition to their clanks we hear a distant chugging sound.

	TRACKING

	Laterally with the clanking, running feet.

	The chugging sound is very loud.

	RUNNING

	Next to a freight train. A boxcar door is open.

	INSIDE THE BOXCAR

	The lead convict hooks an elbow in and starts hauling himself 
	up, his two clanking friends keeping pace outside.

	Six hobos sit in the boxcar, lounging against sacks of 
	O'Daniel's Flour. They impassively watch the convict clamber 
	in as his two confederates run to keep up.

	The convict hauls himself to his feet. In spite of his stubble 
	he has carefully tended hair and a pencil mustache. He is 
	Everett.

	As he dusts himself off:

				EVERETT
		Say, uh, any a you boys smithies?

	The hobos stare.

	Everett gives an ingratiating smile as, behind him, the second 
	convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar, the third 
	convict still keeping pace outside.

				EVERETT
		Or, if not smithies per se, were you 
		otherwise trained in the metallurgic 
		arts before straitened circumstances 
		forced you into a life of aimless 
		wanderin'?

	The convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and 
	disappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately 
	after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward in 
	turn, smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the 
	open doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves 
	on the boxcar floorboards.

	The hobos impassively watch.

	OUTSIDE

	The three men tumble, clanking, down the track embankment.

	Squush - they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom.

	They shake their heads clear, then rise to their feet in the 
	muck and watch the train recede.

	Its fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds.

				EVERETT
		Jesus - can't I count on you people?

	The second con is Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Sorry, Everett.

	Everett looks desperately about.

				EVERETT
		All right - if we take off through 
		that bayou-

	The third con, Pete, bald but also with beard stubble, angrily 
	cuts in.

				PETE
		Wait a minute! Who elected you leader 
		a this outfit?

				EVERETT
		Well, Pete, I just figured it should 
		be the one with capacity for abstract 
		thought. But if that ain't the 
		consensus view, hell, let's put her 
		to a vote!

				PETE
		Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!

				EVERETT
		Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!

	Both men look interrogatively to Delmar.

	He looks from Pete to Everett, and nods agreeably.

				DELMAR
		Okay - I'm with you fellas.

	Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen.

	The baying of hounds is louder now, but through it we hear a 
	distant scrape of metal against metal, like the workings of 
	a rusty pump. The men turn in unison to look up the track.

	A small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward 
	them.

	As it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. 
	An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw 
	handle.

	The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to 
	show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs.

	The flatcar draws even and slows.

				EVERETT
		Mind if we join you, ol' timer?

				OLD MAN
		Join me, my sons.

	The three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping.

	The three men exchange glances; Delmar waves a clanking hand 
	before the old man's milky eyes. No reaction.

				DELMAR
		You work for the railroad, grandpa?

				OLD MAN
		I work for no man.

				PETE
		Got a name, do ya?

				OLD MAN
		I have no name.

				EVERETT
		Well, that right there may be why 
		you've had difficulty finding gainful 
		employment. Ya see, in the mart of 
		competitive commerce, the-

				OLD MAN
		You seek a great fortune, you three 
		who are now in chains...

	The men fall silent.

				OLD MAN
		And you will find a fortune - though 
		it will not be the fortune you seek...

	The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the 
	blind prophet.

				OLD MAN
		...But first, first you must travel 
		a long and difficult road - a road 
		fraught with peril, uh-huh, and 
		pregnant with adventure. You shall 
		see things wonderful to tell. You 
		shall see a cow on the roof of a 
		cottonhouse, uh-huh, and oh, so many 
		startlements...

	The cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the 
	track as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame.

				OLD MAN
		...I cannot say how long this road 
		shall be. But fear not the obstacles 
		in your path, for Fate has vouchsafed 
		your reward.  And though the road 
		may wind, and yea, your hearts grow 
		weary, still shall ye foller the 
		way, even unto your salvation.

	The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate 
	his words.

	Loud and sudden:

				OLD MAN
		IZZAT CLEAR?

	The men start, then mumble polite acknowledgement.

	The railroad tracks wind to the setting sun. Reek-a reek-a 
	reek-a - the flatcar rolls, in wide shot, toward the golden 
	horizon.

								FADE OUT

	DAY

	A hot dusty road leading up to a lone farmhouse.

	The three men walk, clanking and abreast.

				DELMAR
		How'd he know about the treasure?

				EVERETT
		Don't know, Delmar-though the blind 
		are reputed to possess sensitivities 
		compensatin' for their lack of sight, 
		even to the point of developing para-
		normal psychic powers. Now clearly, 
		seein' the future would fall neatly 
		into that ka-taggery. It's not so 
		surprising, then, if an organism 
		deprived of earthly vision-

				PETE
		He said we wouldn't get it! He said 
		we wouldn't get the treasure we seek!

	Everett grows testy:

				EVERETT
		Well what does he know - he's an 
		ignorant old man! Jesus, Pete, I'm 
		telling you I buried it myself, and 
		if your cousin still runs this-here 
		horse farm and has a forge and some 
		shoein' impediments to restore our 
		liberty of movement-

	Bang! A rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men.

				CHILD'S VOICE
		Hold it rah chair!

	The front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front 
	porch and a dark screen door.

	The screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the 
	porch and steps down into the sunlight, holding a gun almost 
	bigger than he is. The grimy-faced boy, about eight years 
	old, wears tattered overalls.

				CHILD
		You men from the bank?

				PETE
		You Wash's boy?

				CHILD
		Yassir! And Daddy tolt me I'm to 
		shoot whosoever from the bank!

	He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands.

				DELMAR
		Well, we ain't from no bank, young 
		feller.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I'm also suppose to shoot 
		folks servin' papers!

				DELMAR
		Well we ain't got no papers.

				CHILD
		Yassir! I nicked the census man!

				DELMAR
		There's a good boy. Is your daddy 
		about?

	THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

	Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted 
	bathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm 
	implements overgrown with weeds. He is whittling artlessly 
	at a stick.

	He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, 
	then returns to his whittling.

				WASH
		'Lo, Pete. Hooor yer friends?

				EVERETT
		Pleased to make your acquaintance, 
		Mister Hogwallop. M'name's Ulysses 
		Everett McGill.

				DELMAR
		'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.

				PETE
		How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, 
		thirteen year'n?

	Still looking sourly at his whittling:

				WASH
		You've grown chatty.

	He tosses the stick aside and sighs.

				WASH
		I expect you'll want them chains 
		knocked off.

	THE HOGWALLOP KITCHEN

	The four men and little boy sit around the kitchen table 
	eating stew. A Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair 
	brings him to table height. The cons are now rid of their 
	chains and are dressed in ill-fitting farmer's wear.

	WASH

	They foreclosed on Cousin Vester. He hanged himself a year 
	come May.

				PETE
		And Uncle Ratliff?

				WASH
		The anthrax took most of his cows. 
		The rest don't milk, and he lost a 
		boy to mumps.

				PETE
		Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

	Wash glances at the little boy.

				WASH
		Couldn't say. Mrs. Hogwallop up and 
		R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

				EVERETT
		Mm. Must've been lookin' for answers.

				WASH
		Possibly. Good riddance, far as I'm 
		concerned...

	The three men slurp their stew.

				WASH
		I do miss her cookin' though.

				DELMAR
		This stew's awful good.

				WASH
		Think so?

	He sniffs dubiously at his spoon.

				WASH
		I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday; 
		'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

	LIVING ROOM

	Later. The four men sit about listening to a big box radio. 
	Wash is whittling once again; Everett dips his comb into a 
	pomade jar and carefully works on his hair; Pete is digging 
	around with a toothpick; Delmar dreamily waves one hand in 
	time to the music.

	The music ends.

				ANNOUNCER
		Well, that's the last number for 
		tonight's 'Pass the Biscuits Pappy 
		O'Daniel Flour Hour.' This is Pappy 
		O'Daniel, hopin' you folks been 
		enjoyin' that good old-timey music, 
		and remember, when you're fixin' to 
		fry up some flapjacks or bake a mess 
		a biscuits, use cool clear water and 
		good pure Pappy O'Daniel flour for 
		that 'Pass the Biscuits, Pappy' 
		flavor.  So tune in next week folks, 
		and till then whyncha turn to your 
		better half and sing along with Pappy: 
		'You are my sunshine, my only 
		sunshine...'

	Everett clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Well, guess I'll be turning in...

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

				EVERETT
		Say, Cousin Wash, I guess it'd be 
		the acme of foolishness to inquire 
		if you had a hairnet.

				WASH
		Got a bunch in yon byurra.  Mrs. 
		Hogwallop's, matter of fact.  
		Hepyaseff; I won't be needin' 'em.

	THE THREE MEN

	Sleeping in a hayloft. Everett wears a hairnet over his 
	painstakingly arranged hair.

	Pete snores on the inhale. Delmar whistles on the exhale.

	A spotlight plays over the hayloft ceiling and a voice booms:

				BULLHORN VOICE
		All right boys, itsy authorities.

	The three men rouse themselves.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		We gotcha surrounded. Just come on 
		out grabbin' air!

	Everett shrugs his shoulders and peeks down into the barnyard.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	From high we see a foreshortened lawman holding a bullhorn 
	surrounded by armed deputies.

	Next to the man with the bullhorn, a tin-starred sheriff 
	watches impassively through mirrored sunglasses, a bloodhound 
	drooling at his side.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		And don't try nothin' fancy - your 
		sitchy-ation is purt nigh hopeless.

				DELMAR
		What inna Sam Hill...?

				EVERETT
		Pete's cousin turned us in for the 
		bounty!

				PETE
		The hell you say! Wash is kin!

	An unamplified voice echoes up from the yard:

				VOICE
		Sorry Pete! I know we're kin! But 
		they got this Depression on, and I 
		gotta do fer me and mine!

	Pete screams down from the hayport:

				PETE
		I'M GONNA KILL YOU, JUDAS ISCARIOT 
		HOGWALLOP! YOU MIS'ABLE HOSS-EATIN' 
		SONOFABITCH! YOU-

	RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT- Everett pulls Pete down as a tommy gun spits 
	lead into the hayloft.

				EVERETT
		Damn! We're in a tight spot!

	Pete is enraged:

				PETE
		Damn his eyes! Pa always said never 
		trust a Hogwallop-COME'N GET US, 
		COPPERS!

				BULLHORN VOICE
		So be it! You boys're leavin' us no 
		choice but to smoke you out.

				EVERETT
		Oh no! Lord have mercy!

	Men approach the barn with torches.

				DELMAR
		What do we do now, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Fire! I hate fire!

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY TIN-WEARIN' MOTHERLESS
		BARNBURNIN' COCKROACHES-

	Everett cuts in, his voice breaking:

				EVERETT
		NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD 
		OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK 
		THIS THING OUT!

				DELMAR
		Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

	The hayloft is filling with smoke. Flames lick downstairs.

				PETE
		YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN 
		SKUNKS-

				EVERETT
		Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak 
		with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH 
		THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!

	Pete grabs a flaming faggot and hurls it down at the deputized 
	congregation.

	It lands harmlessly in some scattered straw.

				BULLHORN VOICE
		You choose it, boys - the prison 
		farm or the pearly gates!

	The straw curls, lights, and the fire scuttles over to a 
	parked Black Maria.

	With a loud airy WHOOOF! the undercarriage of the police van 
	pops into flame.

	The man with the bullhorn sees it.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Holy Saint Christopher - OUTA THAT 
		VEHICLE, CHAMP, SHE'S LICKIN' FAR!

	Tommy guns are stored in the back of the van. The drum of 
	one starts spinning.

	Flames lick up the outside of the van as - chinka-chinka-
	chinka - bullet holes walk across the body.

				MAN WITH BULLHORN
		Take cover, boys, THAT AIN'T POPCORN!

	Yelling men scurry away.

	The vehicle rocks and chatters under the force of the many 
	tommy guns now firing inside. Tires pop, hiss and settle; 
	doors pop open; glass shatters.

				VOICES
		Who's that?

	An oncoming car is bouncing crazily across the yard, horn 
	blaring. Deputies leap out of its path.

	The car shoots past the chattering van which still bucks and 
	bounces on its shocks, its interior strobing and flashing as 
	if filled with trapped lightning.

	The speeding car heads directly for the flaming barn door 
	and crashes through in a shower of sparks.

	The car brakes inside the barn and the driver's door flies 
	open. The little Hogwallop boy yells over the roar of the 
	flames:

				BOY
		Come on, boys! I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-
		T!

	Pete, Everett and Delmar pile in.

				DELMAR
		You should be in bed, little fella.

	The doors slam shut and the boy grinds into gear. He has 
	wood blocks strapped to his feet so that he can reach 
	accelerator, brake and clutch. He sits on a Sears Roebuck 
	catalogue to give him a view over the dash.

				BOY
		You ain't the boss a me!

	The car speeds for the far wall, sheeted in flame, and bursts 
	through.

	COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

	The little Hogwallop boy walks away in long shot down the 
	middle of the empty road. His walk is unsteady, the wood 
	blocks still strapped to his feet.

	He turns to face us and hollers:

				BOY
		You candy-butted car-thievin' so's 
		'n so's! I curse yer names!

	Pete enters in the foreground and throws a dirt clod at the 
	boy. It lands shy as Pete yells:

				PETE
		Go back home'n mind yer pa!

	We pan Pete over to the shoulder where the car is stopped, 
	its hood propped open. Everett and Delmar are looking at the 
	engine.

				PETE
		What's the damn problem?

	DRYGOODS STORE

	The proprietor is a bespectacled middle-aged man wearing 
	sleeve garters and a visor. Behind him are stacked, among 
	other necessaries, sacks of O'Daniel Flour. He pushes a small 
	tin across the counter.

				PROPRIETOR
		I can get the part from Bristol; 
		it'll take two weeks. Here's your 
		pomade.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		Two weeks! That don't do me no good!

				PROPRIETOR
		Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

	Everett picks up the tin.

				EVERETT
		Hold on there - I don't want this 
		pomade, I want Dapper Dan.

				PROPRIETOR
		I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry 
		Fop.

				EVERETT
		No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I 
		use Dapper Dan!

				PROPRIETOR
		Watch your language, young fellow, 
		this is a public market. Now, if you 
		want Dapper Dan I can order it for 
		you, have it in a couple of weeks.

				EVERETT
		Well, ain't this place a geographical 
		oddity-two weeks from everywhere!  
		Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!

	PETE AND DELMAR

	On a wooded hillside. They sit at a twig fire, roasting a 
	small creature on a spit.

				EVERETT (O.S.)
		It didn't look like a one-horse 
		town...

	He stalks into frame and plops disgustedly down by the fire.

				EVERETT
		...but try getting a decent hair 
		jelly.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

				EVERETT
		And no transmission belt for two 
		weeks neither.

				PETE
		Huh?! They dam that river on the 
		21st.  Today's the 17th!

				EVERETT
		Don't I know it.

				PETE
		We got but four days to get to that 
		treasure! After that, it'll be at 
		the bottom of a lake!

	He grimly shakes his head.

				PETE
		We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

				DELMAR
		Gopher, Everett?

	Everett has taken out a can of near-empty Dapper Dan. He 
	scrapes the last of it onto his comb and starts combing his 
	hair.

	We hear distant singing - one lone tenor voice.

				EVERETT
		Well, you're right there, but the 
		ol' tactician's already got a plan-

	Everett fishes a gold watch from his pocket and tosses it to 
	Pete.

				EVERETT
		-for the transportation, that is; I 
		don't know how I'm gonna keep my 
		coiffure in order.

	Pete looks at the watch, puzzled.

				PETE
		How's this a plan? How're we gonna 
		get a car?

				EVERETT
		Sell that. I figured it could only 
		have painful associations for Wash.

	Pete pops the front and reads the inscription.

				PETE
		To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop.  
		From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie-
		dellis.

				EVERETT
		It was in his bureau.

	He screws the lid back on the pomade.

	Delmar whistles appreciatively.

				DELMAR
		You got light fingers, Everett. 
		Gopher?

				PETE
		You mis'able little sneak thief...

	He lurches threateningly to his feet.

				PETE
		You stole from my kin!

	Everett scrambles up.

				EVERETT
		Who was fixing to betray us!

				PETE
		You didn't know that at the time!

				EVERETT
		So I borrowed it till I did know!

				PETE
		That don't make no sense!

				EVERETT
		Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in 
		the chambers of the human heart. 
		What the hell's that singing?

	We can make out the words now, sung by the lone tenor.

				VOICE
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you wanna go down...

	People in white robes are drifting down the hill, through 
	the woods behind the campsite. They join in with the lead 
	voice:

				VOICES
		Oh Brothers, let's go down, down to 
		the river to pray...

	Delmar gazes wonderingly at the white-robed figures as he 
	answers Everett:

				DELMAR
		Appears to be... some kinda... con-
		gur-gation. Care for some gopher?

	Everett too watches the white-robed people following in the 
	wake of the tenor. He answers absently:

				EVERETT
		No, thank you Delmar - a third of a 
		gopher would only rouse my appetite 
		without beddin' her back down.

	There are more and more white robes drifting through the 
	woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men.

				DELMAR
		You can have the whole thing - me'n 
		Pete already had one...

	There is an endless stream now, drifting through the 
	foreground, the background, the campsite itself.

				VOICES
		Oh, sisters, let's go down, come on 
		down, don't you want to go down...

				DELMAR
		We ran acrost a gopher village...

	The drifting worshipers wear beatific expressions. One only, 
	a middle-aged woman, notices the three convicts around whom 
	the rest of the flock blindly drifts. She calls to them:

				WOMAN
		Come with us, brothers! Join us and 
		be saved!

	THE RIVER

	White robes stream down the hill, out of the woods, and down 
	the riverbank. The voices swell in a great chorus:

				VOICES
		We went down to the river one day, 
		Studying about that good old way, 
		And who shall wear that robe and 
		crown, Oh Lord, show us the way...

	We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground. 
	He stands belly-deep in the river, easing a white-robed man 
	back-down into the water. Behind him a line of robed singers 
	lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods.

	Pete, Delmar and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down 
	at the river. White-robed people continue to drift past them.

				EVERETT
		I guess hard times flush the chumps.  
		Everybody's lookin' for answers, and 
		there's always-

	Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line.

				EVERETT
		Where the hell's he goin'?

	Delmar has reached the minister and holds his nose as the 
	minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water.

				PETE
		Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's 
		been saved!

				EVERETT
		Pete, don't be ignorant-

	Delmar is slogging back through the water.

				DELMAR
		Well that's it boys, I been redeemed!  
		The preacher warshed away all my 
		sins and transgressions. It's the 
		straight-and-narrow from here on out 
		and heaven everlasting's my reward!

				EVERETT
		Delmar what the hell are you talking 
		about? - We got bigger fish to fry-

				DELMAR
		Preacher said my sins are warshed 
		away, including that Piggly Wiggly I 
		knocked over in Yazoo!

				EVERETT
		I thought you said you were innocent 
		a those charges.

				DELMAR
		Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to 
		say that that sin's been warshed 
		away too!  Neither God nor man's got 
		nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, 
		the water's fine!

	LATER

	The smoldering twig fire. A bloodhound on a leash circles 
	into frame, its tail fiercely wagging.

	We follow it as, nose to the ground and straining against 
	its leash, it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan 
	pomade.

				A VOICE
		All tight, boys! We got the scent!

	A CAR

	Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile. 
	Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both 
	dripping wet.

	Pete is sullen:

				PETE
		The preacher said it absolved us.

				EVERETT
		For him, not for the law! I'm 
		surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave 
		you credit for more brains than 
		Delmar.

				DELMAR
		But there were witnesses, saw us 
		redeemed!

				EVERETT
		That's not the issue, Delmar. Even 
		if it did put you square with the 
		Lord, the State of Mississippi is 
		more hardnosed.

				DELMAR
		You should a joined us, Everett. It 
		couldn't a hurt none.

				PETE
		Hell, at least it woulda washed away 
		the stink of that pomade.

				EVERETT
		Join you two ignorant fools in a 
		ridiculous superstition? Thank you 
		anyway.  And I like the smell of my 
		hair treatment - the pleasing odor 
		is half the point.

	He shakes his head and laughs.

				EVERETT
		Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a 
		bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're 
		my cross to bear-

				DELMAR
		Pull over, Everett - let's give that 
		colored boy a lift.

	A thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes stands 
	on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. He 
	grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and 
	trots up to the open window.

				HITCHHIKER
		You folks goin' through Tishamingo?

	Delmar pushes open the back door.

				DELMAR
		Sure, hop in.

	Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls 
	out.

				EVERETT
		How ya doin', boy? Name's Everett, 
		and these two soggy sonsabitches are 
		Pete and Delmar. Keep your fingers 
		away from Pete's mouth-he ain't had 
		nothin' to eat for the last thirteen 
		years but prison food, gopher, and a 
		little greasy horse.

				HITCHHIKER
		Thank you fuh the lif', suh. M'names 
		Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

	Delmar is genuinely friendly:

				DELMAR
		How ya doin', Tommy. I haven't seen 
		a house in miles. What're you doin' 
		out in the middle of nowhere?

	Tommy is matter-of-fact:

				TOMMY
		I had to be at that crossroads las' 
		midnight to sell mah soul to the 
		devil.

				EVERETT
		Well ain't it a small world, 
		spiritually speakin'! Pete and Delmar 
		just been baptized and saved! I guess 
		I'm the only one here who remains 
		unaffiliated!

				DELMAR
		This ain't no laughin' matter, 
		Everett.

				EVERETT
		What'd the devil give you for your 
		soul, Tommy?

				TOMMY
		He taught me to play this guitar 
		real good.

	Delmar is horrified:

				DELMAR
		Oh, son! For that you traded your 
		everlastin' soul?!

	Tommy shrugs.

				TOMMY
		I wudden usin' it.

				PETE
		I always wondered-what's the devil 
		look like?

				EVERETT
		Well, of course there's all manner 
		of lesser imps'n demons, Pete, but 
		the Great Satan hisself is red and 
		scaly with a bifurcated tail and 
		carries a hayfork.

				TOMMY
		Oh no! No suh! He's white-white as 
		you folks, with mirrors for eyes an'  
		a big hollow voice an' allus travels 
		with a mean old hound.

				PETE
		And he told you to go to Tishamingo?

				TOMMY
		No suh, that was mah idea. I heard 
		they's a man there pays folks money 
		to sing into a can. They say he pays 
		extra effen you play real good.

	Everett's eyes narrow as he studies the man in the rearview.

				EVERETT
		How much does he pay?

	TISHAMINGO

	The car is pulling into the parking lot of a single-story 
	cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a 
	handpainted sign:

	WEZY 
	LISTENING AIN'T NEVER BEEN 
	SO EASY NOR 
	SO FINE

	As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders.

				EVERETT
		All right boys, just follow my lead.

	INSIDE

	Everett strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears 
	dark glasses and holds a white cane.

				EVERETT
		Who's the honcho around here?

				MAN
		I am. Hur you?

				EVERETT
		Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers 
		and these here are the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi-
		Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. 
		We hear you pay good money to sing 
		into a can.

				MAN
		Well that all depends. You boys do 
		Negro songs?

	Everett grimaces, thinking.

				EVERETT
		Sir, we are Negroes. All except our 
		a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, 
		the fella that plays the gui-tar.

				MAN
		Well, I don't record Negro songs. 
		I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey 
		material.  Why, people just can't 
		get enough of it since we started 
		broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel 
		Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' 
		by, but-

				EVERETT
		Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been 
		steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, 
		you're silly with it, aintcha boys?

				PETE
		That's right!

				DELMAR
		That's right! We ain't really Negroes!

				PETE
		All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!

	THE STUDIO

	The three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, 
	who plays his guitar into a can microphone. They are 
	performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant 
	Sorrow'.

	When they finish Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back.

				EVERETT
		Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you 
		did sell your soul to the devil!

				MAN
		Boys, that was some mighty fine 
		pickin' and singin'. You just sign 
		these papers and I'll give you ten 
		dollars apiece.

				EVERETT
		Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll 
		have to scratch Xes - only four of 
		us can write.

	THE LOT

	A caravan of two oversize cars is pulling into the lot just 
	as Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station 
	door, whooping it up.

	A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by 
	suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly is 
	getting out of the first car. His face is familiar from 
	countless sacks of Pass the Biscuits Pappy O'Daniel Flour.

	Delmar waves a fistful of money at him.

				DELMAR
		Hey mister! I don't mean to be tellin' 
		tales out a school, but there's a 
		man in there hands out ten dollars 
		to anyone sings into his can!

				PAPPY
		I'm not here to make a record, ya 
		dumb cracker, they broadcast me out 
		on the radio.

	A big shambling man of about thirty has followed him out of 
	the car. He has the sloping shoulders, the pasty skin, and 
	the aimlessly bobbing head of an intellectual flyweight.

				JUNIOR
		That's Governor Menelaus 'Pass the 
		Biscuits, Pappy' O'Daniel, and he'd 
		sure 'preciate it if you ate his 
		farina and voted him a second term.

	Two other members of the retinue, older men whose girth rivals 
	the governor's, are Eckard and Spivey.

				ECKARD
		Finest governor we've ever had in 
		M'sippi.

				SPIVEY
		In any state.

				ECKARD
		Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; 
		I was makin' the larger point.

	As Pappy brushes by them, Junior wheedles:

				JUNIOR
		Aintcha gonna press the flesh, Pappy, 
		do a little politickin'?

	Pappy slaps at the young man with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'll press your flesh, you dimwitted 
		sonofabitch - you don't tell your 
		pappy how to cawt the elect 'rate!

	Pappy waves his hat at the radio building as singers in faux 
	hillbilly outfits with various musical instrument cases get 
	out of the second car.

				PAPPY
		We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we 
		mass communicatin'!

				ECKARD
		Oh, yes, assa parful new force.

				SPIVEY
		Mm-mm.

	The men head for the station, with Junior lagging.

				PAPPY
		Shake a leg, Junior! Thank God your 
		mama died givin' birth-if she'd a 
		seen ya she'd a died of shame...

	A CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	Tommy sits in the background, playing and singing a slow 
	blues. The three convicts, holding coffee cups, gaze into 
	the fire.

	Over the dreamy song:

				DELMAR
		Why don't we bed down out here 
		tonight?

				PETE
		Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

				EVERETT
		Suits me...

	He stretches out.

				EVERETT
		Pretty soon it'll be nothin' but 
		feather beds'n silk sheets.

	Pete swishes his coffee as he stares into the blaze.

				PETE
		A million dollars.

				EVERETT
		Million point two.

				DELMAR
		Five... hunnert... thousand... each.

				EVERETT
		Four hundred, Delmar.

				DELMAR
		Izzat right?

				EVERETT
		What're you gonna do with your share 
		of the treasure, Pete?

				PETE
		Go out west somewhere, open a fine 
		restaurant. I'm gonna be the maider 
		dee.  Greet all the swells, go to 
		work ever' day in a bowtie and tuxedo, 
		an' all the staff'll all say Yassir 
		and Nawsir and in a Jiffy Pete...

	He gives his coffee a thoughtful swish and murmurs:

				PETE
		An' all my meals for free...

				EVERETT
		What about you, Delmar? What're you 
		gonna do with your share a that dough?

				DELMAR
		Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns 
		down at the Indianola Savings and 
		Loan and slap that cash down on the 
		barrelhead and buy back the family 
		farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man 
		if you ain't got land.

				PETE
		What about you, Everett? What'd you 
		have in mind when you stoled it in 
		the first place?

				EVERETT
		Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still 
		don't, really.

				PETE
		Well that hardly sounds like you...

	A distant Voice:

				VOICE
		All right, boys, itsy authorities!

	The three men tense up. Tommy stops singing.

				VOICE
		Your sitchy-ation is purt nigh 
		hopeless!

	Pete shovels dirt onto the fire as Delmar and Everett scramble 
	to peek over a low ridge.

	Their point-of-view shows a lone barn with their car parked 
	to one side. Various police vehicles have pulled up facing 
	the barn, and armed men, their backs to us, train guns on 
	it, some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars.

				EVERETT
		Damn! They found our car!

	The man with the bullhorn continues, directing his comments 
	at the distant barn:

				MAN
		We ain't got the time-and nary 
		inclination-to gentle you boys no 
		further!

	The three convicts notice the sheriff who once again stands 
	impassively next to the man with the bullhorn, holding a 
	leash against which a bloodhound strains.

				MAN
		It's either the penal farm or the 
		fires of damnation-makes no nevermind 
		to me!

	The sheriff makes a signal to a man holding a torch, who 
	skitters up to the barn and lights it.

				DELMAR
		Damn! We gotta skedaddle!

				EVERETT
		I left my pomade in that car! Maybe 
		I can creep up!

				DELMAR
		Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R-
		U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!

				EVERETT
		Where's Tommy?

				PETE
		Already lit out, scared out of his 
		wits. Let's go!

	DAYTIME ROAD

	The three men shuffle down the dusty road.

				PETE
		The hell it ain't square one! Ain't 
		no one gonna pick up three filthy 
		unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em 
		a know-it-all that can't keep his 
		trap shut!

				EVERETT
		Pete, the personal rancor reflected 
		in that remark I don't intend to 
		dignify with comment, but I would 
		like to address your general attitude 
		of hopeless negativism. Consider the 
		lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- 
		take a look at Delmar here as your 
		paradigm a hope.

				DELMAR
		Yeah, look at me.

				EVERETT
		Now you may call it an unreasoning 
		optimism. You may call it obtuse. 
		But the plain fact is we still have... 
		close to... close to...

	He loses his drift as all three men turn, reacting to the 
	sound of an approaching speeding car.

				EVERETT
		...close to... three days... before 
		they dam that river...

	The car comes into view cornering on two wheels. It crashes 
	back onto all four and, as it speeds along, dollar bills 
	snap and flutter out its windows. The car roars up to the 
	three men as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb. It screeches to 
	a halt.

	The driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike 
	face, leans over to call through the passenger window.

				DRIVER
		Is this the road to Itta Bena?

				PETE
		Uh... Itta Bena...

	Delmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill out of the air and 
	looks at it wonderingly. He holds it stretched between two 
	hands, brings the two sides together, then gives it an 
	appraising pop.

				EVERETT
		Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...

				PETE
		Isn't it, uh...

	Like a child gazing at soap bubbles, Delmar looks around at 
	the wafting currency, and yanks another fluttering bill out 
	of the air.

				EVERETT
		I'm thinkin' it's uh, you could take 
		this road to, uh...

	There is the sound of a distant siren.

	The driver, still patiently leaning over to hear out the two 
	brainwrackers, shoots a quick look in his rearview mirror.

				PETE
		...Nah, that ain't right... I'm 
		thinkin' of...

				EVERETT
		...I believe, unless I'm very much 
		mistaken - see, we've been away for 
		several years, uh...

	The driver pushes open the passenger door.

				DRIVER
		Hop on in while you give it a think.

	The three men climb in and the car squeals out.

	INT. CAR

	The driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the 
	sirens grow louder, then gropes inside his coat.

				DRIVER
		Any a you boys know your way around 
		a Walther PPK?

				DELMAR
		Well now, that's where we cain't 
		help ya. I don't believe it's in 
		Mississippi.

	The man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his 
	passengers. Delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering 
	inside the car:

				DELMAR
		Friend, some of your folding money 
		has come unstowed.

				DRIVER
		Just stuff it down that sack there. 
		You boys aren't badmen, I take it?

				DELMAR
		Well, funny you should ask-I was 
		bad, till yesterday, but me'n Pete 
		here been saved. My name's Delmar, 
		and that there's Everett.

				DRIVER
		George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

	He opens his door and steps onto the running board, giving 
	Everett a casual:

				NELSON
		Grab the tiller, will ya buddy?

	Everett slides over, startled. George Nelson, now fully 
	outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped 
	on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other.

				NELSON
		Hand up that Thompson, Jack.

	Delmar gropes in the footwell.

				DELMAR
		Say, what line of work are you in, 
		George?

	EXT. CAR

	Nelson sends a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car.

				NELSON
		COME AND GET ME, COPPERS! YOU 
		FLATFOOTED LAMEBRAINED SOFT-ASSED 
		SONOFABITCHES! NO ONE CAN CATCH ME!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON! I'M BIGGER THAN 
		ANY JOHN LAW EVER LIVED! HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! I'M TEN-AND-A-HALF FEET TALL AND 
		AIN'T YET FULLY GROWED!

	Nelson fires wildly as the pursuit cars gain on him, returning 
	fire. He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the 
	roadside and murmurs:

				NELSON
		...cows...

	He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop.

				NELSON
		I hate cows worse than coppers!

	He lets loose a spray. One of the cows drops and the rest 
	stampede toward the road.

				DELMAR
		Aww, George, not the livestock.

	Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing:

				NELSON
		HA-HA! COME ON YOU MISERABLE SALARIED 
		SONSABITCHES! COME AND GET ME!

	In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police 
	pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. 
	The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling 
	wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes.

	SMALL TOWN

	The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through 
	light traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means 
	of clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits.

	The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the 
	three convicts emerge to follow him.

				NELSON
		COME ON BOYS! WE'RE GOIN' FOR THE 
		RECORD-THREE BANKS IN TWO HOURS!

	Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through 
	the door of the bank, followed by the three men.

	He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table.

				NELSON
		OKAY FOLKS! HOLD THE APPLAUSE AND 
		DROP YER DRAWERS - I'M GEORGE NELSON 
		AND I'M HERE TO SACK THE CITY A ITTA 
		BENA!

	He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young 
	woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on 
	the lips.

	Delmar nudges Everett.

				DELMAR
		He's a live wire though, ain't he?

				NELSON
		Thanky dear! All the money in the 
		bag, and you can tell your grandkids 
		you were done by the best! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	He winks at the three men who obediently wait.

				NELSON
		It's a kick and a quarter, ain't it 
		boys?

	Distant sirens again.

				EVERETT
		Pardon me, George, but have you got 
		a plan for gettin' outa here?

				NELSON
		Sure boys, here's m'plan!

	He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of 
	dynamite.

				NELSON
		They ain't never seen ordnance like 
		this!  WELL, THANK YOU, FOLKS, AND 
		REMEMBER: JESUS SAVES, BUT GEORGE 
		NELSON WITHDRAWS!  HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-
		HA! GO FETCH THE AUTO-VOITURE, PETE!

	He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as 
	customers murmur.

				VOICE
		...it's Babyface Nelson...

	George whirls.

				NELSON
		WHO SAID THAT?!

	The customers stare mutely back.

				NELSON
		WHAT IGNORANT LOWDOWN SLANDERIZING 
		SONOFABITCH SAID THAT?! MY NAME IS 
		GEORGE NELSON, GET ME?!

	The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably 
	about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to 
	steer him toward the door.

				DELMAR
		They didn't mean anything by it, 
		George.

				NELSON
		GEORGE NELSON! NOT BABYFACE! YOU 
		REMEMBER AND YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS!  
		I'M GEORGE NELSON, BORN TO RAISE 
		HELL!

	OUTSIDE THE BANK

	The siren grows louder as the four men emerge.

				EVERETT
		You gotta be a little tolerant, 
		George; all these poor folk know is 
		the legend.  Hell, they can't be 
		expected to appreciate the complex 
		individual underneath-  

				NELSON
		Aww, I'm all right-

	He shrugs off Everett's hand and lights the fuse on a stick 
	of dynamite.

				NELSON
		This'll put me right back on top!

	The car squeals up and, as sirens approach once again, the 
	three men pile in.

				NELSON
		OR-VOIR, ITTA BENA! GEORGE NELSON 
		THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

	As the car peels out - KA-BOOM! - the dynamite blows a crater 
	in the street behind.

	CAMPFIRE

	It is night.

	George Nelson, now strangely quiet, holds a coffee cup and 
	stares gloomily into the fire.

	After a long beat, Delmar, also staring into the fire, slaps 
	one knee and ejaculates:

				DELMAR
		Damn but that was some fun though, 
		won it George?!

	George responds, barely audible and without brightening:

				GEORGE
		...yeah...

	Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. Delmar, however, 
	is less sensitive to the Babyface's mood.

				DELMAR
		Almost makes me wish I hadn't been 
		saved! Jackin' up banks - I can see 
		how a fella could derive a lot a 
		pleasure and satisfaction out of it!

				GEORGE
		...it's okay...

				DELMAR
		Whoa doggies!

	At length George swishes the coffee around his cup, shrugs, 
	tosses the coffee and rises.

				GEORGE
		...Well, I'm takin' off.

	He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded 
	Delmar.

				GEORGE
		You boys can have the automobile.

	Glassy-eyed, he continues to dig in his pockets and lets his 
	money fall to the ground.

				GEORGE
		'N might as well take my share a the 
		riches.

				DELMAR
		What the - where you goin', George?

	George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the 
	campfire's flickering circle of light.

				GEORGE
		...I dunno... who cares...

	Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's 
	retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money.

				DELMAR
		Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?

				EVERETT
		Well ya know, Delmar, they say that 
		with a thrill-seekin' personality, 
		what goes up must come down. Top of 
		the world one minute, haunted by 
		megrims the next. Yep, it's like our 
		friend George is a alley cat and his 
		own damn humors're swingin' him by 
		the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; 
		he'll be back on top again. I don't 
		think we've heard the last of George 
		Nelson.

	Delmar, gazing out at the blackness that has closed over 
	George Nelson, hasn't really been listening. He turns sadly 
	back.

				DELMAR
		Damn! I liked George.

	A FIELD

	A ploughing farmer has paused to look for the source of 
	distant string-band music, growing closer. There is also an 
	approaching amplified voice:

				VOICE
		Don't be saps for Pappy; vote for 
		Stokes and responsible gummint!

	A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the 
	field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the 
	candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed 
	of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he 
	pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if 
	conducting the music.

				VOICE
		He's against the Innarests and for 
		the little man!

	This, the driver's voice, is amplified through a flared 
	speaker mounted on the roof of the cab. As the oncoming truck 
	draws near, the midget bellows out at the farmer, who has 
	removed his hat to scratch his forehead.

				MIDGET
		Greetings, brother! Vote for Stokes!

	The voice tails away:

				MIDGET
		Clean gummint is yours for the askin'!

	Our pan with the passing truck comes to rest on the WEZY 
	radio building.

	INSIDE

	We are pulling back from a close shot of the portly blind 
	man.

				MAN
		Hang on! Lemme slap up a wire.

	He turns away to load a recording as he talks into a 
	microphone.

				MAN
		Folks, here's my cousin Ezzard's 
		niece Eudora from out Greenwood doin' 
		a little number with her cousin Tom-
		Tom which I predict you're just gonna 
		enjoy thoroughly.

	He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll 
	Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his 
	attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby.

				MAN
		Now what can I do you for, Mister 
		French?

				FRENCH
		How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys?

				MAN
		Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely 
		recollect, uh -

				FRENCH
		They cut a record in here, few days 
		ago, old-timey harmony thing with a 
		guitar Accump-accump-uh-

				MAN
		Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I 
		believe, swell bunch a boys, sung 
		into yon can and skedaddled.

				FRENCH
		Well that record has just gone through 
		the goddamn roof! They're playin' it 
		as far away as Mobile! The whole 
		damn state's goin' ape!

				MAN
		It was a powerful air.

				FRENCH
		Hot damn, we gotta find those boys!  
		Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's 
		bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the 
		goddamn competition will!

				MAN
		Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that 
		competition.

	'I'll Fly Away' mixes up to play full over the following.

	MONTAGE

	- The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun 
	shimmering off the rough pavement. Their bank loot, wrapped 
	in a bandanna, is knotted to the end of a stick slung over 
	Delmar's shoulder.

	- A different road under a threatening sky. The three men 
	stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two 
	little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of 
	ice. A horse-drawn cart rumbles in from offscreen and Everett 
	waggles his thumb. Thunder rumbles.

	- A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black 
	label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy 
	Bottom Boys.

	- A high shot looking down through the rain past the dripping 
	eave of a barn, under which Everett, Pete and Delmar have 
	taken cover. The three hold their coats pinched shut at the 
	neck as they look forlornly up at the weather.

	- The three men walk along a red dirt road elevated through 
	a bayou.

	- The three men sit around a campfire. Everett sits on a 
	stump, expressively telling a ghost story as Pete and Delmar 
	gaze at him from below, wide-eyed and rapt.

	- The three men walk past a cotton field dotted with burst 
	pods.

	- A Woolworth's interior. A sad-faced woman in a calico dress 
	addresses the clerk:

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys 
		performing 'Man of Constant Sorrow'?

				CLERK
		No, ma'am, we had a new shipment in 
		yesterday but we just can't keep it 
		on the shelves.

	The sad-faced woman is crestfallen.

				SAD-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, mercy. Then - just the purple 
		toilet water.

	- The three men walk down a road excavated through banks of 
	clay, from which gnarled tree roots protrude.

	- A pie rests on a windowsill, steam wafting from it. A hand 
	enters from below the sill outside and disappears with the 
	pie. A moment later we see Everett's and Pete's backs as 
	they scamper away across the yard. A short beat, and then 
	Delmar peeks over the sill. He ducks back down and then his 
	hand reaches up to leave a dollar bill. Moments later we see 
	him scampering away after Pete and Everett.

	- Another campfire. The three men sit around it laughing as 
	they enjoy the pie, each with a slab on a plate improvised 
	of old newspaper. Everett finishes his piece, licks his thumb 
	and tosses the newspaper onto the fire.

	We jump in to look at the soiled newspaper as flame begins 
	to curl its edge. A story is headlined 'TVA Finalizing Plans 
	for Flooding of Arktabutta Valley'. The flame curls the page 
	away, briefly revealing the page beneath - with a story 
	headlined 'Soggy Bottom Boys a Sensation - But Who Are They?' - 
	before it too is consumed.

	- A little general store. We are very high, looking down at 
	a foreshortened Everett, Pete, Delmar and store clerk, who 
	is wielding a long telescoping pole that stretches toward 
	us. Everett is pointing up, directing the man with the pole. 
	He moves it tentatively to and fro until, at a certain point, 
	Everett nods vigorously.

	A reverse shows the end of the pole - a long stock-pincher - 
	as it closes over a tin of Dapper Dan pomade, resting on a 
	high shelf.

	The exterior of the store shows it to be on a corner of a 
	little crossroads town. The three men are emerging from the 
	store just as a car pulls up to one of the two bubble-topped 
	gas pumps out front. A fancyman in a boater hat gets out of 
	the car and heads for the store, passing the three; Everett 
	glances at him and, as the man disappears inside, he dives 
	into his car, waving for Delmar and Pete to follow. Delmar, 
	initially reluctant, is hauled into the car by Pete, and the 
	men take off.

	- The spinning 78 recording, as the song enters its last 
	verse.

	- A spinning car wheel.

	- A panoramic boom up as the car toodles away, down a road 
	that winds through scrub grass toward a distant sunset.

	THE CAR

	The three men are driving through the heat of the day. Everett 
	drives; Pete is slouched in the front passenger seat; Delmar, 
	in back, picks out 'I'll Fly Away' on a banjo.

	Pete listens to something, squints, tilts his head.

				PETE
		...Shutup, Delmar.

	Delmar and Everett exchange glances; Everett shrugs and Delmar 
	desists.

	We can faintly hear a high, unearthly singing. Barely human, 
	the sound seems to agitate Pete. He looks desperately out 
	the window.

	His hinging point-of-view shows, down the declivity from the 
	road and half hidden by trees, three women washing clothes 
	in the river.

	Pete's reaction is enormous. He jams a fist into his mouth, 
	eyes widening. He yanks the fist out and screams:

				PETE
		PULL OVER!

	Everett, startled, does so.

	EXT.

	Before the car has even come to a stop Pete's door flies 
	open and he is stumbling down the bank to the river.

	Everett and Delmar follow more casually, Everett chuckling.

				EVERETT
		I guess o' Pete's got the itch.

	AT THE RIVER

	The unearthly singing, full volume here, comes from the three 
	women, beautiful but marked by an otherworldly langor as 
	they dunk clothes in the stream and beat them against rocks.

	Pete is all awkward smiles and deep, burning eyes:

				PETE
		Howdy do, ladies. Name of Pete!

	Strangely, the three laundresses do not answer, though they 
	do smile at him as they continue to sing.

	Pete tries again as he reaches into their laundry basket:

				PETE
		Maybe I could help you with the, uh-

	He realizes he is holding ladies' undergarments.

				PETE
		Ahem. I, uh...

	He drops them back in the basket.

				PETE
		I don't believe I've, uh, heard that 
		song before...

	Everett and Delmar have arrived; Everett is loud and jovial:

				EVERETT
		Aintcha gonna innerduce us, Pete?

	Pete's eyes stay glued on the women as he hisses out of the 
	corner of his mouth:

				PETE
		Don't know their names. I seen 'em 
		first!

	Everett laughs lightly.

				EVERETT
		Ladies, you'll have to pardon my 
		friend here; Pete is dirt-ignorant 
		and unschooled in the social arts. 
		My name on the other hand is Ulysses 
		Everett McGill and you ladies are 
		about the three prettiest water lilies 
		it's ever been my privilege to admire.

	None of the women respond but, as all continue to sing, one 
	brings a jug marked with three Xes to Everett.

				EVERETT
		Why, thank you dear, that's very, 
		uh...

	He takes a swig.

				EVERETTE
		Mm. Corn licker, I guess, uh, the 
		preferred local uh...

	He passes the jug to Pete as the woman runs her fingers 
	through his hair.

	The other two women are approaching to likewise tousle Pete 
	and Delmar.

	Delmar's woman caresses his face and, by squeezing his cheeks, 
	smushes his mouth into a pucker.

				DELMAR
		Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

	The singing continues. The stream gurgles. Somewhere, in the 
	distance, flies lazily buzz.

				PETE
		Damn!

								FADE OUT

								 FADE IN

	CLOSE ON DELMAR

	We are very tight. Delmar's eyes are closed. We hear loud 
	snoring. At length his eyelids flutter open, but the snoring 
	continues.

	Delmar groggily props himself on one elbow.

	It is late afternoon. He is still on the riverbank. Everett 
	snores nearby.

	The ladies are gone. The hamper of laundry is gone. Pete is 
	gone.

	After looking blearily about for a moment, Delmar starts and 
	staggers to his feet.

				DELMAR
		Holy Saint Christopher!

	He toes Everett urgently in the ribs.

				EVERETT
		Whuhh...

				DELMAR
		Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

	Pete's clothes are laid out on the ground, not in a heap, 
	but mimicking the human shape, as if he had been simply 
	vaporized fron within them.

	Everett rouses himself and looks at the clothes: He scans 
	the opposite river bank.

				EVERETT
		PETE! Where the heck are ya! We ain't 
		got time for your shenanigans!

	Delmar stares horrified at the pile of clothes: a spot in 
	the middle of the shirt is rising and falling, rising and 
	falling.

				DELMAR
		Sweet Jesus, Everett! They left his 
		heart!

	Everett joins Delmar to look. The rhythmic rising and falling 
	now travels up the shirt. A large yellow toad sticks its 
	head out from under the collar.

	Delmar keens. Everett is bewildered.

				EVERETT
		What on earth is goin' on here! What's 
		got into you, Delmar!

				DELMAR
		Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh-
		reens did this to Pete! They loved 
		him up an' turned him into a horney-
		toad!

	The toad hops down the river bank.

				DELMAR
		Pete! Come back!

	He slides down the bank after the toad, Everett watching in 
	perturbation.

	The toad plops into the river and Delmar dives in after him. 
	He emerges a moment later with the toad wriggling in his 
	hand.

				DELMAR
		Don't worry, Pete! It's me, Delmar! 
		Oh Everett! What're we gonna do?!

	DRIVING

	We hear soft whimpering as Everett drives, sneaking worried 
	glances over at the passenger seat.

	Delmar has the toad in his lap. He whimpers as he pets it.

	Everett hesitantly offers:

				EVERETT
		...I'm not sure that's Pete.

				DELMAR
		Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

	The frog croaks.

				DELMAR
		We gotta find some kinda wizard can 
		change 'im back!

	A beat. Delmar continues to whimper.

	Everett squints and shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		...I'm just not sure that's Pete.

	FINE RESTAURANT

	The tables are formally laid with linen. Delmar and Everett 
	sit at a table, a shoebox between them, deep in conversation.

				EVERETT
		You can't display a toad in a fine 
		restaurant like this! Why, the good 
		folks here'd go right off their feed!

				DELMAR
		I just don't think it's right, keepin' 
		him under wraps like we's ashamed of 
		him.

				EVERETT
		Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of 
		him.  The way I see it he got what 
		he deserved - fornicating with some 
		whore a Babylon.  These things-

	He points a knife at the shoebox.

				EVERETT
		-don't happen for no reason, Delmar.
		Obviously it's some kind of judgment 
		on Pete's character.

	ANOTHER PATRON

	We are looking over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man 
	in a cream-colored suit and a shirt with powder-blue collar. 
	He is digging into a huge plateful of steak and eggs. Sensing 
	something, he looks up, cocks his head, and then slowly turns 
	to look back.

	He thus reveals a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue 
	trim; his good eye is looking intently off - at Everett and 
	Delmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	Still heatedly discussing.

				DELMAR
		The two of us was fixing to fornicate!

	The waitress has just arrived for their order. Everett gives 
	her an ingratiating laugh:

				EVERETT
		Heh-heh. You'll have to excuse my 
		rusticated friend here, unaccustomed 
		as he is to city manners.

	He ostentatiously fans some of his money.

				EVERETT
		Well mamzel I guess we'll have a 
		couple a steaks and some gratinated 
		potatoes and wash it down with your 
		finest bubbly wine-

	BIG MAN

	Watching Everett fan his money. The big man stops chewing 
	and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty 
	pat.

	BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR

	As Everett closes his menu.

				EVERETT
		...And I don't suppose the chef'd 
		have any nits or grubs in the pantry, 
		or - naw, never mind, just bring me 
		a couple leafs a raw cabbage.

				WAITRESS
		Yes sir.

	The big man appears as she leaves.

				BIG MAN
		Don't believe I've seen you boys 
		around here before! Allow me 
		t'innerduce myself: name of Daniel 
		Teague, known in these precincts as 
		Big Dan Teague or, to those who're 
		pressed for time, Big Dan toot court.

				EVERETT
		How d'you do, Big Dan. I'm Ulysses 
		Everett McGill; this is my associate 
		Delmar O'Donnell.  I sense that, 
		like me, you are endowed with the 
		gift of gab.

	Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair.

				BIG DAN
		I flatter myself that such is the 
		case; in my line of work it's plumb 
		necessary. The one thing you don't 
		want is air in the conversation.

				EVERETT
		Once again we find ourselves in 
		agreement.  What kind of work do you 
		do, Big Dan?

				BIG DAN
		Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what 
		do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed 
		word of it, from Genesee on down to 
		Revelations! That's right, the word 
		of God, which let me add there is 
		damn good money in during these days 
		of woe and want! Folks're lookin' 
		for answers and Big Dan Teague sells 
		the only book that's got 'em! What 
		do you do - you and your tongue-tied 
		friend?

				DELMAR
		Uh, we uh-

				EVERETT
		We're adventurers, sir, currently 
		pursuin' a certain opportunity but 
		open to others as well.

				BIG DAN
		I like your style, young man, so I'm 
		gonna propose you a proposition. You 
		cover my check so I don't have to 
		run back up to my room, have your 
		waitress wrap your dinner picnic-
		style, and we'll retire to more 
		private environs where I will explain 
		to you how vast amounts of money can 
		be made in the service of God Amighty.

	Everett rises and digs in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		Well, why not. If nothing else I 
		could use some civilized conversation.

	As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a 
	tilt of the head and a crinkling smile.

				BIG DAN
		Don't forget your shoebox, friend.

	We hear bellowing issuing from a curtained private dining-
	room.

	INSIDE THE PRIVATE ROOM

	Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of 
	whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue.

				PAPPY
		Languishing! Goddamn campaign is 
		languishing! We need a shot inna 
		arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn 
		ARM!  Election held tomorra, that 
		sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a 
		walk!

				JUNIOR
		Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

	Pappy narrows his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting 
	at.

				PAPPY
		...Yeah?

				JUNIOR
		Well people like that reform. Maybe 
		we should get us some.

	Pappy whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it.

				PAPPY
		I'll reform you, you soft-headed 
		sonofabitch! How we gonna run reform 
		when we're the damn incumbent!

	He glares around the table.

				PAPPY
		Zat the best idea any you boys can 
		come up with? REEform?! Weepin' Jesus 
		on the cross! Eckard, you may as 
		well start draftin' my concession 
		speech right now.

	Eckard grunts as he starts to rise.

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	Pappy whips him back down with his hat.

				PAPPY
		I'm just makin' a point, you stupid 
		sonofabitch!

				ECKARD
		Okay, Pappy.

	As he settles back Eckard looks around the table and helpfully 
	relays:

				ECKARD
		Pappy just makin' a point here, boys.

	A MEADOW

	The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off 
	the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with 
	bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak.

	Everett, Delmar and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large 
	picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of 
	chicken off a bone.

	He tosses the bone over his shoulder, belches, and sighs.

				BIG DAN
		Thankee boys for throwin' in that 
		fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite 
		and even with lunch under my belt I 
		was feeling a mite peckish.

				EVERETT
		Our pleasure, Big Dan.

				BIG DAN
		And thank you as well for that 
		conversational hiatus; I generally 
		refrain from speech while engaged in 
		gustation. There are those who attempt 
		both at the same time but I find it 
		course and vulgar. Now where were 
		we?

				DELMAR
		Makin' money in the Lord's service.

				BIG DAN
		You don't say much friend, but when 
		you do it's to the point and I salute 
		you for it.

	Delmar is pleased and embarrassed.

				DELMAR
		Oh, it weren't nothin', I-

				BIG DAN
		Yes, Bible sales. The trade is not a 
		complicated one; there're but two 
		things to learn. One bein' where to 
		find your wholesaler - word of God 
		in bulk as it were. Two bein' how to 
		reckanize your customer - who're you 
		dealin' with? - an exercise in 
		psychology so to speak.

	He rises to his feet and tosses down his napkin.

				BIG DAN
		And it is that which I propose to 
		give you a lesson in right now.

	He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off 
	a tree. He casually strips its twigs.

				EVERETT
		I like to think that I'm a pretty 
		astute observer of the human scene.

				BIG DAN
		No doubt, brother - I figured as 
		much back there in the restaurant. 
		That's why I invited you out here 
		for this advanced tutorial.

	His club is ready. He swings at Delmar who staggers back 
	with a grunt.

	Everett wears a puzzled smile.

				EVERETT
		...What's goin' on, Big Dan?

	Delmar, though stunned, is faster to size things up. He 
	charges Big Dan and wraps his arms around him.

	Delmar roars.

	Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head.

	Everett is still puzzled, but willing to be instructed:

				EVERETT
		Big Dan, what're you doin'?

	Big Dan walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still 
	attached to him like a hunting dog locked on to a bear. Big 
	Dan takes a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow 
	to Everett.

	The blow catches Everett on the chin and sends him reeling.

				BIG DAN
		It's all about money, boys! Atsy 
		answer! Dough re mi!

	Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away. He whacks 
	Everett into a semi-conscious heap and then paws through his 
	pockets.

				BIG DAN
		Do unto others before they do unto 
		you!

	He pulls out their wad of cash.

				BIG DAN
		I'll just take your show cards...

	He walks over to Delmar who is on the ground moaning, and 
	kicks him several times.

				BIG DAN
		...and whatever you got in the hole.

	He takes Delmar's shoebox and flips off the top.

	Inside is a bed of straw with the toad resting on it.

				BIG DAN
		What the...

	He pokes around the straw with his finger; nothing else 
	inside.

				BIG DAN
		It's nothin' but a damn toad!

	Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes.

	Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist.

	Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips:

				DELMAR
		No... you don't understand...

				BIG DAN
		Don't you boys know these things 
		give ya warts?

	He squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against 
	a tree.

				DELMAR
		Oh Lord... Pete...

	Big Dan is over at the car, cranking it up.

				BIG DAN
		End of lesson.

	He climbs in.

				BIG DAN
		So long, boys! Hee-hee! See ya in 
		the funny papers!

	The car belches and pops and toodles off down the road.

	Delmar staggers to his feet and stumbles over to the carcass 
	of the frog, weeping.

				DELMAR
		Pete... Pete... Pete...

								FADE OUT

	PAN DOWN FROM BLACK TO BRING IN A TORCH

	Flickering in the night. We hear the rumble of distant thunder 
	as the continued pan down brings the torch's bearer into 
	frame - a man with the slavering grin of the dim-witted 
	sadist. He watches as we hear:

				VOICE
		Where are they?!

	There is the sound of a lash and a scream.

				VOICE
		Talk, you unreconstructed whelp of a 
		whore! Where they headed?

	Another lash brings another scream.

	The screams come from Pete. His arms, stretched high over 
	his head, are tied to a tree limb. His interrogator wields a 
	bullwhip.

				INTERROGATOR
		Your screams ain't gonna save your 
		flesh! Only your tongue is, boy!

	Another lash, another scream.

				INTERROGATOR
		Where they headed!

	A third man walks into the torchlight, a hound drooling at 
	his heels. He is Cooley, the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses 
	whom we remember from previous barn confrontations.

				COOLEY
		Lump. I.O.

	The two men acknowledge by backing away from Pete.

	We hear a pat... pat... and then the accelerating pitter-
	patter of arriving rain.

	Cooley looks up.

				COOLEY
		Sweet summer rain. Like God's own 
		mercy.

	He looks back down at Pete.

				COOLEY
		Your two friends have abandoned you, 
		Pete.  They don't seem to care 'bout 
		your hide.

	He shrugs, looks off.

				COOLEY
		...Okay.

	Looking up, into black: a rope is tossed up - it recedes out 
	of the torchlight into black night - and then drops back 
	down into the light, a noose bouncing at its end.

				COOLEY
		Stairway to heaven, Pete.

	The two henchmen fit the noose over Pete's neck. Cooley licks 
	his lips. His dog slobbers.

				COOLEY
		We shall all meet, by and by.

				PETE
		Goddamnit!

	Cooley holds up one hand. The two men pause in fitting the 
	noose.

	Pete is sobbing:

				PETE
		Godfer gimme!

	Thunder crashes.

	BACK OF A HAYTRUCK

	Everett and Delmar sit disconsolately on a haybale as the 
	stakebed truck bounces along a rough country road. They are 
	both ill-kempt and heavily bruised.

	Though still an undammable river of verbiage, Everett now 
	seems to be talking out of weary habit, not conviction:

				EVERETT
		Believe me, Delmar, he would've wanted 
		us to press on. Pete, rest his soul, 
		was one sour-assed sonofabitch and 
		not given to acts of pointless 
		sentimentality.

	Delmar doggedly shakes his head.

				DELMAR
		It just don't seem right, diggin' up 
		that treasure without him.

	We distantly hear picks ringing and male chanting. Hollow-
	eyed, Everett tries to convince himself as much as Delmar:

				EVERETT
		Maybe it's for the best that Pete 
		was squushed. Why, he was barely a 
		sentient bein'. Now, soon as we clean 
		ourselves up, get a little smell'um 
		in our hair, we're just gonna feel a 
		hunnert per cent better about 
		ourselves and about...

	His voice trails away as he looks out at the road.

	They are passing a line of chained men in prison stripes and 
	duck-billed caps wielding pickaxes and shovels at the side 
	of the road. Guards bearing shotguns amble back and forth.

	As he stares at the line of men Everett tries to pick up his 
	thread:

				EVERETT
		...and about... life in general...

	The prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust.

				EVERETT
		Jesus. We must be near Parchman Farm.

	The men, giving throat to a dolorous chain-gang chant, do 
	not look up at the passing haytruck.

	Everett is haunted:

				EVERETT
		Sorry sonsabitches... Seems like a 
		year ago we bust off the farm...

	The last man in line swings his pick and, as he grows smaller, 
	looks up. Everett stares.

	It is Pete.

	Lone and lorn, he returns Everett's slack-jawed stare until 
	heat ripples and the truck's dusty wake dissolve him away.

	Everett blinks.

				EVERETT
		Pete have a brother?

				DELMAR
		Not that I'm aware.

	Everett shakes his head as if to clear it.

				EVERETT
		Heat must be gettin' to me.

	The truck rattles on.

	TOWN SQUARE

	Ithaca, Mississippi. On a bunting-covered stage a pencil-
	necked man with round rimless glasses addresses a crowd of 
	rustics.

	The pencil-neck is identified on posters as 'Homer Stokes, 
	Friend of the Little Man', and, in life as in the pictures, 
	he shakes a broom over his head. A midget in overalls stands 
	next to him.

				STOKES
		And I say to you that the great state 
		a Mississippi cannot afford four 
		more years a Pappy O'Daniel - four 
		more years a cronyism, nepotism, 
		rascalism and service to the 
		Innarests!  The choice, she's a clear 
		'un: Pappy O'Daniel, slave a the 
		Innarests; Homer Stokes, servant a 
		the little man! Ain't that right, 
		little fella?

	The midget enthusiastically seconds:

				MIDGET
		He ain't lyin'!

				STOKES
		When the litle man says jump, Homer 
		Stokes says how high? And, ladies'n 
		jettymens, the little man has 
		admonished me to grasp the broom a -
		ree-form and sweep this state clean!

	The midget waves his little midget broom in time with Stoke's 
	waves.

				STOKES
		It's gonna be back to the flour mill, 
		Pappy! The Innarests can take care a 
		theyselves! Come Tuesday, we gonna 
		sweep the rascals out! Clean gummint - 
		yours for the askin'!

	He beams amid cheers and then, as three girls in gingham 
	frocks run out to join him:

				STOKES
		An' now - the little Wharvey gals!  
		Whatcha got for us, darlin's?

	The oldest girl is about ten.

				LITTLE GIRL
		'In the Highways'!

				STOKES
		That's fine.

	The haytruck has pulled into the square and Everett and Delmar 
	are climbing out.

	Everett stares at the stage.

				EVERETT
		Wharvey gals?! Did he just say the 
		little Wharvey gals?

	Delmar shrugs. For some reason, Everett is enraged:

				EVERETT
		Goddamnit all!

	Onstage, the three girls are singing in untrained but 
	enthusiastic harmony:

				GIRLS
		In the highways, In the hedges...

	Everett stomps toward the stage, fighting his way through 
	the crowd. Puzzled, Delmar follows.

				DELMAR
		You know them gals, Everett?

	Everett reaches the stage and climbs up into the wings just 
	as the song ends. The midget starts buck-dancing to a fiddle 
	tune as the three little girls, filing off, notice Everett.

				YOUNGEST
		Daddy!

				MIDDLE
		He ain't our daddy!

				EVERETT
		Hell I ain't! Whatsis 'Wharvey' gals? - 
		Your name's McGill!

				YOUNGEST
		No sir! Not since you got hit by a 
		train!

				EVERETT
		What're you talkin' about - I wasn't 
		hit by a train!

				MIDDLE
		Mama said you was hit by a train!

				YOUNGEST
		Blooey!

				OLDEST
		Nothin' left!

				MIDDLE
		Just a grease spot on the L&N!

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I never been hit by any train!

				OLDEST
		At's right! So Mama's got us back to 
		Wharvey!

				MIDDLE
		That's a maiden name.

				YOUNGEST
		You got a maiden name, Daddy?

				EVERETT
		No, Daddy ain't got a maiden name; 
		ya see -

				MIDDLE
		That's your misfortune!

				YOUNGEST
		At's right! And now Mama's got a new 
		beau!

				OLDEST
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Yeah, I know 'bout that.

				MIDDLE
		Mama says he's bona fide!

	This worries Everett:

				EVERETT
		Hm. He give her a ring?

				YOUNGEST
		Yassir, big'un!

				MIDDLE
		Gotta gem!

				OLDEST
		Mama checked it!

				YOUNGEST
		It's bona fide!

				MIDDLE
		He's a suitor!

				EVERETT
		Hm. What's his name?

				MIDDLE
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				YOUNGEST
		Uncle Vernon.

				OLDEST
		Till tomorrow.

				YOUNGEST
		Then he's gonna be Daddy!

				EVERETT
		I'm the only damn daddy you got! I'm 
		the damn paterfamilias!

				OLDEST
		Yeah, but you ain't bona fide!

				EVERETT
		Hm. Where's your mama?

	Stokes is announcing from the stage:

				STOKES
		And now let's fetch back the Wharvey 
		gals to sing 'I'll Fly Away'.

	The girls call over their shoulders as they run back onstage:

				MIDDLE
		She's at the five and dime.

				YOUNGEST
		Buyin' nipples!

	WOOLWORTH'S

	The faces of a six-year-old girl and her four-year-old sister 
	light up.

				GIRLS
		Daddy!

	Next to them is a two-year-old girl with a string wrapped 
	around her waist. The other end of the string is held by a 
	woman in her thirties with a haggard, careworn face. The 
	woman also holds a babe-in-arms.

	Everett, entering, goggles at the infant.

				EVERETT
		Who the hell is that?!

				WOMAN
		Starla Wharvey.

				EVERETT
		Starla McGill you mean! How come you 
		never told me about her?

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		'Cause you was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		And that's another thing - why're 
		you tellin' our gals I was hit by a 
		train!

				WOMAN
		Lotta respectable people been hit by 
		trains. Judge Hobby over in Cookeville 
		was hit by a train. What was I 
		supposed to tell 'em - that you was 
		sent to the penal farm and I divorced 
		you from shame?

				EVERETT
		Well - I take your point. But it 
		leaves me in a damned awkward position 
		vis-a-vis my progeny.

	A man in a straw boater joins them.

				BOATER
		'Lo Penny... This gentleman bothering 
		you?

				EVERETT
		You Waldrip?

				BOATER
		That's right.

	Everett sniffs and, catching a scent, squints.

	Waldrip's hair, protruding from under his boater, is plastered 
	against his scalp.

				EVERETT
		...Have you been using my hair 
		treatment?

				WALDRIP
		Your hair treatment?!

	Everett covers his anger with an exaggerated politeness.

				EVERETT
		S'cuse me...

	He draws Penny aside.

				EVERETT
		Well, I got news for you case you 
		hadn't noticed - I wasn't hit by a 
		train. And I've traveled many a weary 
		mile to be back with my wife and six 
		daughters.

				SIX-YEAR-OLD
		Seven, Daddy!

				PENNY
		That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. 
		Your daddy was hit by a train.

				EVERETT
		Now Penny, stop that!

				PENNY
		No - you stop it! Vernon here's got 
		a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's 
		bona fide! What're you?

				EVERETT
		I'll tell you what I am - I'm the 
		paterfamilias! You can't marry him!

				PENNY
		I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! 
		I gotta think about the little Wharvey 
		gals! They look to me for answers! 
		Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em 
		lessons on the clarinet! The only 
		good thing you ever did for the gals 
		was get his by that train!

				EVERETT
		...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... 
		succubus!

				WALDRIP
		You can't swear at my fiancee!

				EVERETT
		Oh yeah? Well you can't marry my 
		wife!

	With this he takes a wild swing which Waldrip easily eludes.   
	Waldrip adapts a Marquess of Queensbury stance and prances 
	about, delivering stinging punches to the nose of a stunned 
	and outclassed Everett.

	A crowd is gathering and voices murmur:

				BYSTANDERS
		Who is that man?

				PENNY
		He's not my husband. Just a drifter, 
		I guess... Just some no-account 
		drifter...

	EXT. WOOLWORTH'S

	Its glass doors swing open and Everett is hurled out and 
	bellyflops into the dust of the street.

				BRAWNY MANAGER
		...And stay out of Woolworth's!

	MOVIE THEATER

	Romantic music tinnily plays as Delmar and Everett watch, 
	Everett slumped down and angrily hissing:

				EVERETT
		Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! 
		Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember 
		that one simple precept and your 
		time with me will not have been ill 
		spent!

				DELMAR
		Okay, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' 
		to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the 
		subjective!  You ever been with a 
		woman?

				DELMAR
		Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family 
		farm back before I can start thinkin' 
		about that.

				EVERETT
		Well that's right! If then! Believe 
		me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish 
		instrument of torture ever devised 
		to bedevil the days a man!

				DELMAR
		Everett, I never figured you for a 
		paterfamilias.

				EVERETT
		Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. 
		And you see what it, uh... what it's 
		earned me... Now what in the...

	The screen is flickering down to black as the music slows to 
	sludge and stops.

	The theater is dark and quiet.

	Everett and Delmar, and the rest of the sparse audience, 
	look restively about.

	A man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium.

	He walks halfway down the aisle and stops several rows behind 
	Delmar and Everett. He scans the theater, then brings a 
	whistle to his lips.

	At his whistle the back doors burst open and a line of chained 
	men trot in at double-time. With much clanking they file 
	into one row and then, that row filled, the one behind it. 
	They remain silently on their feet.

	The first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts 
	scan the theater. The first guard again blows his whistle.

	The two rows of chained men sit.

	After another silence:

				FIRST GUARD
		...Okay boys! Enjoy yer pickcha show!

	One more whistle cues the movie to grind back up to speed.

	A hissing whisper from behind draws Everett and Delmar's 
	attention:

				VOICE
		Do not seek the treasure! It's a 
		bushwhack!

	Everett and Delmar turn and stare, saucer-eyed. In the middle 
	of the frontmost row of convicts sits Pete - bald, haunted 
	Pete.

	After a long, disbelieving stare:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

	Pete whispers again, urgently:

				PETE
		They're fixin' a ambush! Do not seek 
		the treasure!

	Everett, jaw hanging open, can only stare, as if at a ghost. 
	Delmar stares also, but finally brings out another:

				DELMAR
		...Pete?

				PETE
		Do not seek the treasure!

	Everett's face remains frozen in horrified disbelief, but 
	Delmar finally accepts Pete's corporeal reality.

				DELMAR
		We thought you was a toad!

	Pete squints and cocks his head as if to say, What was that?

	Delmar repeats the whisper slowly and with exaggerated mouth 
	movements:

				DELMAR
		We thought... you was... a toad!

	Pete shakes his head - didn't catch it - and repeats, also 
	overarticulating:

				PETE
		Do not... seek... the treasure!

	A guard murmurs:

				GUARD
		Quiet there. Watcha pickcha.

	VERANDA

	Pappy O'Daniel sits on the veranda of the Governor's Mansion, 
	smoking a cigar and sipping from a glass of bourbon as the 
	evening sun goes down.

				PAPPY
		I signed that bill! I signed a dozen 
		a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone 
		knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! 
		What do I gotta do, start diddlin' 
		livestock?!

				JUNIOR
		We cain't do that, Daddy, we might 
		offend our constichency.

				PAPPY
		We ain't got a constichency! Stokes 
		got a constichency!

				ECKARD
		Them straw polls is ugly.

				SPIVEY
		Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.

				ECKARD
		Gonna pluck us off the tit.

				SPIVEY
		Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants 
		down and Stokes at the table soppin' 
		up the gravy.

				ECKARD
		Latch right on to that tit.

				SPIVEY
		Wipin' little circles with his bread.

				ECKARD
		Suckin' away.

				SPIVEY
		Well, it's a well-run campaign, 
		midget'n broom'n whatnot.

				ECKARD
		Devil his due.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva awgazation.

				JUNIOR
		Say, I gotten idee.

				ECKARD
		What sat, Junior?

				JUNIOR
		We could hire us a little fella even 
		smaller'n Stokes's.

	Pappy whips at him with his hat.

				PAPPY
		Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a 
		guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha 
		satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies 
		braggin' on our own midget! Don't 
		matter how stumpy! And that's the 
		goddamn problem right there - people 
		think this Stokes got fresh ideas, 
		he's oh coorant and we the past.

				ECKARD
		Problem a p'seption.

				SPIVEY
		Ass right.

				ECKARD
		Reason why he's pullin' ah pants 
		down.

				SPIVEY
		Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.

				ECKARD
		Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna 
		kick it real hard.

	With his mouth forming an O around his dropping cigar, Pappy 
	looks sadly from one to the other, like a spectator at a 
	particularly boring tennis match.

				SPIVEY
		No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle 
		it.

				ECKARD
		Well now, I don't believe assa 
		property scription.

				SPIVEY
		Well, that's how I characterize it.

				ECKARD
		Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' 
		sichation.

				SPIVEY
		Pullin' ah pants down...

				ECKARD
		Wipin' little circles with his 
		bread...

	A NOOSE

	In slow motion it is dropping... dropping... dropping through 
	the night. We hear distant thunder and the howl of a hound. 
	The sounds recede, and the black background dissolves into a 
	pan down from a raftered ceiling as the noose fades away.

	The continued pan down shows that we are in a barracks-like 
	cabin. It is night. Convicts are ranged in bunk-beds. Their 
	snores stand out against the chirp of crickets.

	In the upper berth of the foreground bed is Pete. His hands 
	are clasped behind his head. A manacle and chain links one 
	wrist to a rail that serves as headboard.

	He stares up, haunted, at the phantom noose.

				PETE
		I could not gaze upon that far 
		shore...

	He reacts quizically to a whispered:

				VOICE
		Pete!

	A moment later Everett rises over the lip of his bed. His 
	face is blacked and he sways as if standing on a boat.

				EVERETT
		Hold still.

	He is raising a large, long-armed, short-nosed pincering 
	tool. He locks the nose onto Pete's chain and levers the 
	arms. As his hand chinks free, Pete does not react to his 
	newfound liberty.

	We hear an agonized voice from off as Everett continues to 
	sway:

				DELMAR
		...Cain't stand much longer.

	Pete's eyes burn into Everett's.

				PETE
		It was a moment a weakness!

				EVERETT
		Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to 
		skedaddle.

	THE THREE MEN

	We track with them as they walk through the moonlit woods. 
	Delmar's and Everett's faces are thoroughly blacked; Pete is 
	just finishing blacking his, and he hands the shoe polish 
	back to Everett.

				PETE
		They lured me out for a bathe, then 
		they dunked me'n trussed me up like 
		a hog and turned me in for the bounty.

				EVERETT
		I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly 
		behavior. Just lucky we left before 
		they came for us.

				DELMAR
		We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just 
		thought you was a toad.

				PETE
		No, they never did turn me into a 
		toad.

				DELMAR
		Well that was our mistake then. And 
		then we was beat up by a bible 
		salesman and banished from 
		Woolworth's. I don't know if it's 
		the one branch or all of 'em.

				PETE
		Well I - I ain't had it easy either, 
		boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled 
		my guts about the treasure.

				DELMAR
		Huh?!

				PETE
		Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; 
		must be my Hogwallop blood.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right, Pete.

	Pete is shaking his head, miserable.

				PETE
		It's awful white of ya to take it 
		like that, Everett. I feel wretched, 
		spoilin' yer play for a million 
		dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' 
		at my guts.

				EVERETT
		Aw, that's all right.

	Pete starts weeping.

				PETE
		You boys're true friends!

	He hugs a stunned Delmar.

				PETE
		You're m'boon companions!

	He hugs Everett, who looks profoundly uncomfortable.

				EVERETT
		Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat 
		yourself up about this thing...

				PETE
		I cain't help it, but that's a 
		wonderful thing to say!

				EVERETT
		Well, but Pete...

	He clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Uh, the fact of the matter is - well, 
		damnit, there ain't no treasure!

	Now it is Pete's turn to be stunned. He and Delmar stare at 
	Everett.

				EVERETT
		Fact of the matter - there never 
		was!

				PETE
		But... but...

				DELMAR
		So - where's all the money from your 
		armored-car job?

				EVERETT
		I never knocked over any armored-
		car. I was sent up for practicing 
		law without a license.

				PETE
		But...

				EVERETT
		Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My 
		wife wrote me she was gettin' married! 
		I gotta stop it!

	Pete stares vacantly off.

				PETE
		...No treasure... I had two weeks 
		left on my sentence...

				EVERETT
		I couldn't wait two weeks! She's 
		gettin' married tomorra!

				PETE
		...With my added time for the escape, 
		I don't get out now 'til 1987... 
		I'll be eighty-four years old.

	Delmar, not angry himself, is trying to work it out.

				DELMAR
		Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty 
		years for me too.

				EVERETT
		Boys, we was chained together. I 
		hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out 
		alone was not a option!

				PETE
		...Eighty-four years old.

	Delmar brightens.

				DELMAR
		I'll only be eighty-two.

	Pete lunges at Everett.

				PETE
		YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

	He tackles him and, with his hands wrapped round Everett's 
	throat, the two roll over.

				EVERETT
			(strangled)
		Pete... I do apologize.

				PETE
		Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' 
		pab-you-lum!

	They have rolled through some brush and their bodies are now 
	halfway into a clearing. They abruptly stop.

	Pete, lying on top of Everett, looks up, startled by loud 
	chanting. Everett, lying on his back, tries to see as well, 
	his eyes rolling back in his head.

	Their point-of-view shows a great open field where men in 
	bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross.

	Pete and Everett hastily crabwalk back into the bushes and 
	then push through with Delmar.

	The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, 
	intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At 
	length they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to 
	face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning 
	cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold.

	An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the 
	burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The 
	backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from 
	the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett.

	As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, 
	whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet.

				BLACK MAN
		I ain't never harmed any you 
		gentlemen!

	Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		It's Tommy! They got Tommy!

				DELMAR
		Oh my God!

	It is indeed Tommy Johnson.

				TOMMY
		I ain't never harmed nobody!

	Pete is staring aghast at the makeshift gibbet.

				PETE
		The noose. Sweet Jesus! We gotta 
		save 'im!

	A broad-shouldered man in the middle of the ranks of Klansmen, 
	sensing something, slowly turns to look back over his 
	shoulder. He thus reveals that his hood has only one eye-
	hole.

	He slowly draws off his hood. It is, of course, Big Dan 
	Teague. His one good eye looks about; his other eye, now 
	revealed, is hideously clouded and stares up and off in fixed 
	sightlessness.

	Everett, still crouched behind the bushes, notices something. 
	He hisses and points.

				EVERETT
		The color guard.

	Off to one side is a robed and hooded three-man color guard 
	displaying a Confederate flag.

	In front of the crowd the Imperial Wizard raises one satin-
	draped arm, and the chanting stops.

				WIZARD
		Brothers! We are foregathered here 
		to preserve our hallowed culture'n 
		heritage!  From intrusions, inclusions 
		and dilutions!  Of culluh! Of creed! 
		Of our ol'-time religion!

	Over in the bushes Everett, Delmar and Pete are straightening 
	up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having 
	disposed of the color guard.

				WIZARD
		We aim to pull evil up by the root! 
		Before it chokes out the flower of 
		our culture'n heritage! And our women! 
		Let's not forget those ladies, y'all, 
		lookin' to us for p'tection! From 
		darkies! From Jews! From Papists! 
		And from all those smart-ass folk 
		say we come descended from the 
		monkeys!  That's not my culture'n 
		heritage!

	A roar from the crowd.

				WIZARD
		Izzat your culture'n heritage?

	Another roar.

				WIZARD
		And so... we gonna hang us a neegra!

	A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting.

	The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the 
	two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy! It's us!

	Behind Everett in the deep background someone emerges from 
	the ranks into the middle aisle. He approaches with a strong, 
	purposeful stride - Big Dan Teague, bareheaded, holding his 
	hood under his arm.

	Everett hisses again:

				EVERETT
		Hey Tommy!

	Tommy looks back over his shoulder.

				TOMMY
		...Huh?

	Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind.

				EVERETT
		It's us! We come to rescue ya!

				TOMMY
		That's mighty kind of ya boys, but I 
		don't think nothin's gonna save me 
		now - the devil's come to collect 
		his due!

				PETE
		Tommy, you don't wanna get hanged!

				TOMMY
		Naw I don't guess I do, but that's 
		the way it seems to be workin' out.

				EVERETT
		Listen to me, Tommy, I got a plan -

	Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. 
	Everett is exposed - in blackface.

	The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned.

	Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in 
	blackface.

	From the crowd:

				VOICE
		The color guard is colored!

	Big Dan roars.

	The crowd roars.

	Everett screams:

				EVERETT
		Run, boys!

	Pandemonium breaks out, and the Imperial Wizard takes off 
	his red satin hood for a better view.

	He is the reform candidate Homer Stokes. Next to him, his 
	midget also pulls of his midget hood.

	Stokes is peeved.

				STOKES
		Who made them the color guard?

	Everett, Pete, Tommy and Delmar, bearing the Confederate 
	flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating 
	the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues 
	in full cry.

	When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. 
	He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd.

	Homer Stokes is mortified.

				STOKES
		Damn! Can't let that flag touch the 
		ground!

	The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence.

	The only sound is the fluttering flag.

	Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the 
	flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend.

	We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned 
	white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague.

	His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off 
	returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging 
	distance and trajectory.

	From somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping.

	The flag flutters.

	The crowd is silent.

	Big Dan sets and...

	WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together.

	He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the 
	ground.

	The crowd cheers.

	Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers.

	From somewhere, another BOINK.

	As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades.

	His eye tracks up - up-

	CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.

	At the foot of the cross Everett snaps its last guy wire 
	with his pincers - BOINK - and the four men sprint off.

	WHOOOOSH - As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward 
	Big Dan, frozen, looking up.

	It crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates 
	Big Dan Teague.

	A PACKARD

	It is pulling up in front of a town hall from which party 
	sounds filter out.

	Pappy O'Daniel emerges from the car with his retinue - Eckard, 
	Spivey and Junior.

				PAPPY
		I'm sayin' we har this man away.

				ECKARD
		Assa good idea, Pappy.

				SPIVEY
		Helluva idea.

				ECKARD
		Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.

				SPIVEY
		Have him join us, run our campaign 
		'stead a that pencil-neck's.

				ECKARD
		Enticements a power, wealth, settera.

				SPIVEY
		No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

				ECKARD
		Oh gracious no. Not with his 
		blandishments.

				SPIVEY
		Powas p'suasion.

				PAPPY
		What's his name again?

				ECKARD
		Campaign manager? Waldrip.

				SPIVEY
		Vernon Waldrip.

				ECKARD
		Vernon T. Waldrip.

				PAPPY
		Hmm... His folks from out Tuscarora?

				SPIVEY
		Tuscarora? Might be. I b'lieve they 
		is.

				ECKARD
		Not a doubt in my mind.

	Pappy is disgusted:

				PAPPY
		You don't know where his goddamn 
		folks from; you speakin' outcha 
		asshole.

				ECKARD
		Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it 
		that strong...

	As the three men make their way up the steps, Eckard's voice 
	is fading:

				ECKARD
		...but p'haps yaw right...

	In wide shot, they disappear into the building.

	A reverse shows the wide shot to have been the point-of-view 
	of Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy, who peek out from the 
	mouth of an alley. Everett hisses his intelligence:

				EVERETT
		Well, it's a invitation-only affair; 
		we'll have to sneak in through the 
		service entrance-

				PETE
		Wait a minute - who elected you leader 
		a this outfit? Since we been followin' 
		your lead we got nothin' but trouble! 
		I gotten this close to bein' strung 
		up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped 
		no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -

				DELMAR
		'N turned into a frog -

				EVERETT
		He was never turned into a frog!

	Delmar sulks:

				DELMAR
		Almost loved up though.

	Everett is stunned.

				EVERETT
		So you're against me now, too!... Is 
		that how it is, boys?

	Silence. No one wants to meet Everett's eye. He is saddened.

				EVERETT
		The whole world and God Almighty... 
		and now you. Well, maybe I deserve 
		this. Boys, I... I know I've made 
		some tactical mistakes. But if you'll 
		just stick with me; I need your help. 
		And I've got a plan.  Believe me, 
		boys, we can fix this thing! I can 
		get my wife back! We can get outta 
		here!

	Headlights play; the men suck back into the alley as a car 
	passes by.

	The car tools up to the banquet hall and Homer Stokes emerges 
	with his midget. The midget tosses his balled-up white hood 
	into the car and both men shrug into their suitcoats.

	Stokes is angry:

				STOKES
		...goddamn disgrace. Made a travesty 
		of the entire evenin'...

	They too start up the stairs. Stokes's pace is brisk and the 
	midget hops awkwardly to keep up.

				STOKES
		...what I wouldn't give to get my 
		hands on those agitators. Whoever 
		heard a such behavior. Even among 
		culluds. Or mulattos, maybe - I 
		suspect some miscegenation in their 
		heritage... how else you goin' explain 
		it - usin' the Confed'it flag as a 
		missile...

	BANQUET HALL KITCHEN

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are entering through the 
	back door. The blackface has been scrubbed off but all four 
	now wear long gray beards as disguise, clumsily affixed with 
	spirit gum. Each is carrying a musical-instrument case.

	They elbow past the bustling kitchen help.

				EVERETT
		Scuse me... scuse me... we're the 
		next act...

				DELMAR
		Everett, my beard itches.

				PETE
		This is crazy. No one's ever gonna 
		believe we're a real band.

				EVERETT
		No, this is gonna work! I just gotta 
		get close enough to talk to her. 
		Takin' off with us is got a lot more 
		future in it than marrying a guy 
		named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona 
		fide. I've got the answers!

	HEAD TABLE

	Out in the banquet hall Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side 
	at the head table, surrounded by the Wharvey gals. Penny and 
	Waldrip are facing the hall with their backs to the stage as 
	the four bearded band members - Everett, Pete, Delmar and 
	Tommy - take their places.

	Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair with an arm draped 
	over his shoulder, leaning in to murmur confidentially.  
	Waldrip sits stiffly erect as he listens, frowning at a spot 
	in space.

	Suddenly Waldrip erupts:

				WALDRIP
		Well that's a improper suggestion!  
		I can't switch sides in the middle 
		of a campaign!  Especially to work 
		for a man who lacks moral fibre!

				PAPPY
		Moral fibre?!

	He waves his cane, outraged.

				PAPPY
		You pasty-faced sonofabitch, I 
		invented moral fibre!

	Up on the stage, the band has launched into a song.

				PAPPY
		Pappy O'Daniel was displayin' 
		rectitude and high-mindedness when 
		that pencil-neck you work for was 
		still messin' his drawers!

	A hissed Voice:

				VOICE
		Psst! Penny! Hey! Up here!

	As the two men continue to exchange sharp words, penny turns 
	her head to look steeply up over her shoulder.

	Everett is up onstage just behind her. As the rest of the 
	band continues to play, he is parting his beard to hiss down 
	at her:

				EVERETT
		Penny! It's me!

	Dismayed, she shakes her head and tries to unobtrusively 
	wave him away. He is undeterred:

				EVERETT
		No, Penny, listen! We're leavin' the 
		state! Pusuin' opportunities in 
		another venue! I got big plans! Not 
		minstrelsy; this-here's just a dodge - 
		I'm gonna be a dentist! I know a guy 
		who'll print me up a license! I wanna 
		be what you want me to be, honey! I 
		want you and the gals to come with 
		me!

	She shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate 
	as Everett continues pleading to her back:

				EVERETT
		They're my daughters, Penny! I'm the 
		king a this goddamn castle!

	Stokes has ambled up to the head table.

				STOKES
		What're you doin' here, Pappy? I 
		guess someone let on there was free 
		liquor, heh-heh.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, you'll be laughin' out the 
		other side your face come November.

				ECKARD
		Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.

				SPIVEY
		Not out the other side his face, 
		though.

				ECKARD
		Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -

	This byplay is interrupted by a roar from the crowd.

	The band has launched into 'Man of Constant Sorrow', 
	precipitating the huge reaction. Everett, still trying to 
	get Penny's attention, looks up, stunned at the ovation.

	Cry from the crowd:

				VOICE
		Hot damn! Itsa Soggy Bottom Boys!

	Everett and the boys, still singing, exchange bemused looks. 
	A shrug, and they lean into the song with a will.

	Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing, bringing the 
	crowd to new heights of hysteria.

				PAPPY
		Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!

				JUNIOR
		But Pappy, they's inter-grated.

				PAPPY
		Well I guess folks don't mind they's 
		integrated.

	Stokes is also staring at the band, frowning. He murmurs to 
	himself:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute...

	Everett catches Stokes' look. The two men look at each other, 
	aghast.

	Stokes raises his voice accusingly:

				STOKES
		...you's miscegenated! All you boys!  
		Miscegenated!

	Everett raises the volume of his singing. Stokes cries out:

				STOKES
		Get me a mike-a-phone!

	A mike is thrust into his hand and he bellows into it, 
	overwhelming the music, which the boys eventually abandon. 
	Stokes continues bellowing into the silence:

				STOKES
		These boys is not white! These boys 
		is not white! Hell, they ain't even 
		ol'-timey! I happen to know, ladies'n 
		gentlemen, this band a miscreants 
		here, this very evening, they 
		interfered with a lynch mob inna 
		performance of its duties!

	The crowd stares at him, stone-faced. Stokes plows on:

				STOKES
		It's true! I b'long to a certain 
		society, I don't believe I gotta 
		mention its name, heh-heh...

	Nobody joins in the laugh; Stokes slowly strangles on it.

				STOKES
		...Ahem. And these boys here trampled 
		all over our venerated observances 
		an' rich'ls!  Now this-here music is 
		over! I aim to -

	Boos start up among the crowd.

				STOKES
		I aim to hand these boys over to - 
		listen to me, folks!

	The boos are growing in volume. There are cries of 'More 
	music!' and even one 'Shut up, pencil-neck!'

				STOKES
		Listen to me! These boys desecrated 
		a fiery cross!

	More boos. Waldrip approaches and nudges the microphone away 
	to murmur confidentially in Stokes' ear. Stokes excitedly 
	retrieves the mike and struggles to be heard:

				STOKES
		And they convicts! Fugitives, folks, 
		escaped off the farm!

	This cuts no ice; the boos have become overwhelming.

				STOKES
		Folks, these boys gotta be remanded 
		the 'thorities! Criminals! And I 
		happen to have it from the highest 
		authority that that Neegra sold his 
		soul to the devil!

	He is hit by a tomato.

	The boos are deafening; the Soggy Bottom Boys, sensing 
	opportunity, launch back into the interrupted verse of 'Man 
	of Constant Sorrow'. The boos become wild cheers.

	Stokes is being pelted by foodstuffs. Shielding himself with 
	one arm, he bellows into the mike:

				STOKES
		Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Is you 
		is or is you ain't my constichency?

	INT. RUSTIC CABIN

	Far up some sleepy holler. An old man in overalls and his 
	wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny 
	voice. They look at each other wordlessly, look back at the 
	crystal set.

	BACK TO BANQUET HALL

	Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks 
	apprehensively on.

				STOKES
		Is you is or is you ain't -

	A disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug; 
	Stokes continues to mouth the inaudible words.

	Pappy is considering the crowd.

				PAPPY
		Goddamn! Oppitunity knocks!

	He starts clambering up onto the stage.

	Two men advance through the clapping audience holding high 
	either end of an eight-foot rail. When they reach Stokes, 
	other audience members help load him onto the rail.

	Onstage, Pappy claps along with the audience.

	As they play, the band members fearfully eye Pappy, who 
	advances on them.

	Pappy joyfully shakes his fat ass in time to the music and 
	does a little two-step. The audience roars. The band relaxes, 
	performing with even more gusto.

	Stokes is being through the crowd on the rail, jeered at and 
	pelted with comestibles until he bangs out the exit.

	As the songs rolls into its big finish the audience roars 
	approval, and Pappy elbows in to the microphone, beaming.

				PAPPY
		That's fine, that's fine!...

	He drops one arm around Everett, the other around Delmar.

				PAPPY
		...Ladies'n gentlemens here and 
		listenin' at home, the great state 
		of Mississippi (Pappy O'Daniel, 
		Gov'nor) thanks the Soggy Bottom 
		Boys for that won-a-ful performance!

	Cheers.

				PAPPY
		Now it looks like the only man in 
		our great state who ain't a music 
		luvva, is my esteemed opponent in 
		the upcomin', Homer Stokes -

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Yeah, well, they ain't no accountin' 
		f'taste. It sounded t'me like he 
		harbored some kind a hateful grudge 
		against the Soggy Bottom Boys on 
		account a their rough'n rowdy past.

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Sounds like Homer Stokes is the kinda 
		fella gonna cast the first stone!

	Boos.

				PAPPY
		Well I'm with you folks. I'm a f'give 
		and f'get Christian. And I say, well, 
		if their rambunctiousness and 
		misdemeanorin' is behind 'em - It 
		is, ain't it, boys?

	Everett hesitates, not sure where this is going.

				EVERETT
		Sure is, Governor.

				PAPPY
		Why then I say, by the par vested in 
		me, these boys is hereby pardoned!

	Loud cheers prod Pappy to another level of inspiration:

				PAPPY
		And furthermore, in the second Pappy 
		O'Daniel administration, why, these 
		boys - is gonna be my brain trust!

	Raucous cheers.

	The band beams, but Delmar leans into Everett, worried:

				DELMAR
		What sat mean exactly, Everett?

				EVERETT
		Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are 
		gonna be the power behind the throne 
		so to speak.

				DELMAR
		Oh, okay.

				PAPPY
		So now, without further ado, and by 
		way of endorsin' my candidacy, the 
		Soggy Bottom Boys is gonna lead us 
		all in a chorus of 'You Are My 
		Sunshine' - ain't ya, boys?

	He gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett holds for 
	a considering beat.

				EVERETT
		...Governor - that's one of our 
		favorites!

	Pappy returns a considered appraisal:

				PAPPY
		Son, you gonna go far.

	The song begins.

	LATER

	The steps of the meeting hall. People stream out of the 
	concert into the warm summer night.

	Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps 
	with Penny.

				EVERETT
		I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna 
		be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be 
		able to throw a little patronage his 
		way, get the man a job diggin' ditches 
		or rounding up stray dogs.

				DELMAR
		Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?

				PENNY
		McGill. No, the marriage'll take 
		place as planned.

				EVERETT
		Just a little change of cast. Me and 
		the little lady are gonna pick up 
		the pieces'n retie the knot, 
		mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're 
		invited, of course. Hell, you're 
		best men! Already got the rings.

	He raises Penny's left hand with his own to display their 
	wedding bands - but Penny's finger is bare.

				EVERETT
		Where's your ring, honey?

				PENNY
		I ain't worn it since our divorce 
		came through. It must still be in 
		the rolltop in the old cabin. Never 
		thought I'd need it; Vernon bought 
		one encrusted with jewels.

				EVERETT
		Hell, now's the time to buy it off 
		him cheap.

				PENNY
		We ain't gettin' married with his 
		ring!  You said you'd changed!

				EVERETT
		Aw, honey, our ring is just a old 
		pewter thing -

				PENNY
		Ain't gonna be no weddin'.

				EVERETT
		It's just a symbol, honey -

				PENNY
		No weddin'.

				DELMAR
		We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.

				EVERETT
		Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar -
		it's just -

				PENNY
		I have spoken my piece and counted 
		to three.

	She walks off.

				EVERETT
		Oh, goddamnit! She counted to three!  
		Sonofabitch! You know how far that 
		cabin is?!

	His attention, and everyone else's, is drawn by a procession 
	on the street below. A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a 
	man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being 
	escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their 
	nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation.

	Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the 
	last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar 
	cries out:

				DELMAR
		George!

	It is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his 
	heavy restraints.

				GEORGE
		'Lo, boys! Well, these little men 
		finally caught up with the criminal 
		a the century! Looks like the chair 
		for George Nelson. Yup! Gonna 
		electrify me!  I'm gonna go off like 
		a Roman candle!  Twenty thousand 
		volts chasin' the rabbit through 
		yours truly! Gonna shoot sparks out 
		the top of my head and lightning 
		from my fingertips!

	As he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder:

				GEORGE
		Yessir! Gonna suck all the power 
		right outa the state! Goddamn, boys, 
		I'm on top of the world! I'M GEORGE 
		NELSON AND I'M FEELIN' TEN FEET TALL!

	Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go.

				DELMAR
		Looks like George is right back on 
		top again.

	BLACK

	In the black we hear snuffling, growing louder, closer, 
	slobberier.

	A crack of light. We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being 
	nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout.

	As the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed 
	with light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets, 
	several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	PINEY WOODS

	Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods.

				EVERETT
		Well, at least you boys'll get to 
		see the old manse - the home where I 
		spent so many happy days in the bosom 
		of my family - a refugium, if you 
		will - with a mighty oak tree out 
		front and a happy little tire swing...

	They emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them. 
	It is indeed a peaceful-looking haven with a mighty oak tree 
	in front. There is, however, no tire swing; instead, three 
	nooses hang from one stout limb.

				DELMAR
		Where's the happy little tire swing?

	Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and 
	push them forward.

	Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-
	dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough 
	pine coffin.

	The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the 
	porch, the drooling hound at his heels.

				COOLEY
		End of the road, boys. It's had its 
		twists and turns -

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		- but now it deposits you here.

	The goons are shoving them toward the tree. Three 
	gravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from 
	the three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas 
	round their necks.

				EVERETT
		Waitaminute -

				COOLEY
		You have eluded fate - and eluded me - 
		for the last time. Tie their hands, 
		boys.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this -

				COOLEY
		Didn't know you'd be bringin' a 
		friend.  Well, he'll have to wait 
		his turn -

				EVERETT
		Hang on there -

				COOLEY
		- and share one of your graves.

				EVERETT
		You can't do this - we just been 
		pardoned!  By the Governer himself!

				DELMAR
		It went out over the radio!

				COOLEY
		Is that right?

	The leering goons, who have been lashing the men's wrists 
	behind their backs, pause, their sadism stymied. They look 
	to Cooley for guidance.

	So too does the drooling hound.

	Silence.

	Finally:

				COOLEY
		...Too bad we don't have a radio.

	The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy 
	task.

	The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their 
	shovels. They begin to sing a slow and dirgelike 'You've Got 
	to Walk That Lonesome Valley'. Sweat glistens on them and 
	trickles down their faces like tears.

				PETE
		God have Mercy!

				TOMMY
		It ain't fittin'!

				EVERETT
		It ain't the law!

				COOLEY
		The law. Well the law is a human 
		institution.

	Cooley gives the faintest smile.

				COOLEY
		Perhaps you should take a moment for 
		your prayers.

				PETE
		Oh my God! Everett!

				DELMAR
		I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.

				PETE
		Good Lord, what do we do?

	Pete is in tears. Tommy is terrified. Delmar bows his head 
	to silently pray.

	Everett bows his head as well. He murmurs:

				EVERETT
		Oh Lord, please look down and 
		recognize us poor sinners... please 
		Lord...

	The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell.

				EVERETT
		...I just want to see my daughters 
		again.  Oh Lord, I've been separated 
		from my family for so long...

	The mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more 
	palpable than audible - the song, it seems, rising out of 
	the earth itself.

				EVERETT
		...I know I've been guilty of pride 
		and sharp dealing. I'm sorry that I 
		turned my back on you, Lord. Please 
		forgive me, and help us, Lord, and I 
		swear I'll mend my ways... For the 
		sake of my family... For Tommy's 
		sake, and Delmar's, and Pete's...

	The rumble is building.

				EVERETT
		...Let me see my daughters again. 
		Please, Lord, help us... Please help 
		us...

	The rumble erupts into a deafening roar.

	A wall of water is crashing through the hollow.

	It engulfs everything and everybody. The cabin itself is 
	ripped away; the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their 
	feet and all is noise and confusion.

	UNDERWATER

	A silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural 
	slow motion.

	Suspended around him are scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade.

	Other objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family 
	portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a 
	frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, the wild-eyed frantically 
	paddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it.

	FURTHER DOWNHILL

	The churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly 
	created river, fast-moving but no longer violent.

	After a beat of hold on the rippling waters, the surface is 
	broken by the up-bob of a pine coffin.

	The coffin floats downstream for a beat and then Everett 
	pops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking 
	his head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish 
	freeing himself from the rope round his wrists.

	Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air.

	The men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream. 
	Dazed, they look around.

	The inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or 
	treetop poking out of the newly formed river. All is quiet 
	except for the gurgle of water.

				DELMAR
		A miracle! It was a miracle!

				EVERETT
		Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I 
		told you they was gonna flood this 
		valley.

				DELMAR
		That ain't it!

				PETE
		We prayed to God and he pitied us!

				EVERETT
		It just never fails; once again you 
		two hayseeds are showin' how much 
		you want for innalect. There's a 
		perfectly scientific explanation for 
		what just happened -

				PETE
		That ain't the tune you were singin' 
		back there at the gallows!

				EVERETT
		Well any human being will cast about 
		in a moment of stress. No, the fact 
		is, they're flooding this valley so 
		they can hydro-electric up the whole 
		durned state...

	Everett waxes smug:

				EVERETT
		Yessir, the South is gonna change.  
		Everything's gonna be put on 
		electricity and run on a payin' basis. 
		Out with the old spiritual mumbo-
		jumbo, the superstitions and the 
		backward ways. We're gonna see a 
		brave new world where they run 
		everyone a wire and hook us all up 
		to a grid. Yessir, a veritable age 
		of reason - like the one they had in 
		France - and not a moment too soon...

	His voice trails off as he notices something.

	A cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its 
	eaves. A cow has taken refuge on its roof. It stands staring 
	at Everett, who returns the stare.

	He shakes off the vision and clears his throat.

				EVERETT
		Not a moment too soon. Say, there's 
		Tommy!

	Tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream, clinging to a 
	half-submerged piece of furniture.

				EVERETT
		What you ridin' there, Tommy?

	The furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current 
	and, to keep his head above water, Tommy climbs in place 
	like a hamster on a wheel. As the chest exposes its ribbed 
	upper half:

				TOMMY
		Rolltop desk...

	STREET

	Everett and Penny walk arm in arm, the seven Wharvey gals 
	behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk.

				EVERETT
		All's well that ends well, as the 
		poet says.

				PENNY
		That's right, honey.

				EVERETT
		But I don't mind telling you, I'm 
		awful pleased my adventuring days is 
		at an end...

	He fumbles in his pocket.

				EVERETT
		...Time for this old boy to enjoy 
		some repose.

				PENNY
		That's good, honey.

				EVERETT
		And you were right about that ring. 
		Any other weddin' band would not do. 
		But this-here was foreordained, honey; 
		fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya 
		have to have confidence -

	He is slipping it onto her hand.

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		- in the gods - Huh?

				PENNY
		That's not my ring.

				EVERETT
		Not your...

				PENNY
		That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

				EVERETT
		You said it was in the rolltop desk!

				PENNY
		I said I thought it was in the rolltop 
		desk.

				EVERETT
		You said -

				PENNY
		Or, it might a been under the 
		mattress.

				EVERETT
		You -

				PENNY
		Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.

	Everett shakes his head.

				EVERETT
		Well, I'm sorry honey -

				PENNY
		Well, we need that ring.

				EVERETT
		Well now honey, that ring is at the 
		bottom of a pretty durned big lake.

				PENNY
		Uh-huh.

				EVERETT
		A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.

				PENNY
		I don't care if it's ninety thousand.

				EVERETT
		Yes, but honey -

				PENNY
		That wasn't my doing...

	Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two 
	are pulling forward out of frame.

				EVERETT
		Course not, honey, but...

	We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch, 
	still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we 
	can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal.

	The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of 
	string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and 
	Everett, off:

				PENNY
		I counted to three, honey.

				EVERETT
		Well sure, honey, but...

	We reach the end of the piece of string; it is wrapped around 
	the waist of the toddler, who lingers in frame. She gazes 
	down a quiet street at the edge of town that ends in an open 
	field.

				EVERETT
		...finding one little ring in the 
		middle of all that water...

	His voice, and that of the singing girls, recedes.

				EVERETT
		...that is one hell of a heroic 
		task...

	The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of 
	frame.

	A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The rhythmic 
	clack is from the hand-pumped flatcar.

	The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing 
	harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.

	THE END

          EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
          
          ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.
          
          A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the
          mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN
          ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          the old women. They SCREAM!
          
          The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the
          skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the
          sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          them.
          
          The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running
          and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
          
          The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,
          flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and
          flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
          
          It's an all-out Pervert assault!
          
          The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a
          fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as
          quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an
          assassination.
          
          
          INT. MALL - BUSINESS OFFICES - DAY
          
          MARK, the Mall Manager, walks by a group of women, who     
          were exposed to the Pervert. They crowd around and         
          complain loudly.

          Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the         
          business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S    
          desk.

          The Mall Manager quickly walks off.    On the way, he          
          passes a JANITOR.

          The Mall Manager keeps walking.
          
          
          INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
          
          The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's
          a small office with monitors that show the different
          security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall
          Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word
          ever, turns around in the chair.
          
                                     MARK

          Dennis shrugs.
          
                                                         CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot
          through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT
          is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the
          other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is
          sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose.
          
          A garage door raises and bright light spills in...
          
          
          EXT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE
          GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around.
          The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall
          security guard whose expression reads all business.
          Ronnie pulls out of the garage...
          
          SUPERIMPOSE:    OBSERVE AND REPORT
          
                                                               3.
          
          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
          through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
          see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
          grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a
          car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
          
          Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He
          looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
          
          The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One
          skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
          lot.
          
          The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent
          orange siren and gives chase.
          
          As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls
          up and drives alongside of them.
          
                                  RONNIE
                            (cop authority voice)
                    Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
          
          STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a                      
                    parking lot.                                       
          
                                  RONNIE
                    Sir, pull over to the sidewalk,
                    NOW!
          
          HECTOR, another skater, joins in.
          
                                  HECTOR
                    Leave us alone.                                    
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.
          
                                  RONNIE
                    Skateboarding is not allowed on
                    mall premises. Pull over now!
          
                                  STEVIE
                    We're not leaving.
          
                                  HECTOR
                    Yeah, fuck you!
          
          The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get       
          away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase
          ensues.
          
                                                      (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 4.
          
          CONTINUED:
          
          Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side-
          swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash
          can and fall.
          
          Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie
          tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too
          fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges
          and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he
          has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his
          way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the
          hood.
          
          Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie
          are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely
          behind the two kids.
          
          Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector
          wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving
          off and falls down hard.
          
          Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.
          
          Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies
          over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie
          burns down the lane beside him.
          
          Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.    He's
          in the clear.
          
          Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in
          reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the
          skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.

                       minute to talk. There's no easy                 
                       way to say this so I'm just going               
                       to come right out with it. Mark                 
                       offered me the position of Head of

          Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of
          the shittiest trailer park in town.

          INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Ronnie lives in a boy's room. There's all kind of
          posters up with instructions on how to execute choke
          holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows.
          However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the
          mall.
          
          Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his MOM
          across from him. She's an old, thick boozer, with the
          strength of a father and the love of a mother. She downs
          a full beer and throws it against the wall.
          
                                  MOM

          Ronnie and his Mom take to fighting. Ronnie's Mom is
          surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to
          Ronnie's cranium.

          Ronnie attacks his Mom. He manages to scoop her and body
          slam her to the ground. Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on
          the ground. However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and          
          stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.

          On cue, Ronnie's Mom falls over in a drunken sleep. She
          starts SNORING loud as hell. Ronnie gets out of the
          covers and helps his Mom onto the bed. Ronnie tucks her
          in like a loving son. He pries the bottle from her
          fingers. Then, he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on
          the floor.

          Ronnie walks up to O'Charley's. It's the one-step-up
          restaurant that's in the mall. There's a BOUNCER out
          front who watches over the store.

                       That's what they tell me. They
                       needed to hire a little security
                       here in case the drunks get out of
                       line or whatever.

          the Pervert pops out. This time, he's upped his attack
          and beats off staring right at her.

                       for now. I think the best thing
                       at this point is to just follow up
                       with the other ladies who saw the
                       perpetrator yesterday and see if
                       they remember anything.

          Ronnie looks at Brandi and nods his head "yes."

                       and I'm going to do everything in
                       my power to bring this guy down.

                       Here's my card. I'll even write                     
                       my home phone number on the back,

                       a hold of me.                                       
          
          Detective Harrison writes his number on the back and then        
          hands his card to Brandi.

                       Harrison is here, doesn't mean

                       cool to hang out with. He carries                   
                       a badge and a gun. He probably                      
                       owns a boat. Over time, we'll                       
                       probably become really close like                   
                       brothers, but for right now,                        
                       you're still number one. Now, I                     
                       must leave you behind because duty

                       who steal pennies from the                          
                       fountain has its rewards, but

                       closing cases is where it's at.                     
                       It's rewarding too because at the                   
                       end of the day, you know you've

                       Well, my young apprentice. I

                       Head of Mall Security, I have

                       this recent crime wave. In order                    
                       to help me in my personal journey,

          Ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the      robbery "suspects"    
          on a bulletin board. It's pictures of       Saddamn and the       
          Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a       sketch of the         
          Pervert. The images are on the bottom       points of a           
          Pyramid.                                                          
          
          On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of         
          Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across             
          his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. The           
          whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea         
          is that he defeats them all. Ronnie sits back in his

                       how to put this. Let's see. If                     
                       you drove a Toyota.

                       I know, but let's just pretend you                 
                       drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota                   
                       runs really good. It always                        
                       starts when you need it to and it                  
                       gets good gas mileage and you                      
                       don't have to do much to maintain                  
                       it. Then you get a really                          
                       important job like Astronaut, no                   
                       that won't work, you get a job as                  
                       the head of Wall Street. Well,                     
                       you may really like that Toyota,                   
                       but you're going to feel weird                     
                       about driving it to work every                     
                       day, right? Now let's say that                     
                       somebody offers you a chance to                    
                       get rid of that Toyota and instead                 
                       you get a Ferrari. It may be more                  
                       expensive and harder to drive, but

          Ronnie opens Brandi's door and helps Brandi out. She's           
          almost passed out drunk. Both of her eyes are closed and         
          she immediately tries to sleep on the ground. Ronnie             
          helps her up, but when he does, Brandi gives him a               
          kiss -- a sloppy one.

                       Well, after last night,   I just
                       wanted you to know that   it wasn't
                       just some fling to me.    It meant
                       something special and I   felt it
                       deep in my soul.

                       evaluation, psychological test,
                       background check.

                       a ride along before making this
                       decision. It's where you actually
                       ride along with a real police
                       officer during a routine patrol.
                       It helps give you an idea of the
                       kind of situations you'll be
                       dealing with. Sound good?

          Ronnie and Detective Harrison sit in the parked car.
          They're at the shittiest crack corner in the whole town.
          Lots of scary bums and hookers loiter around the car.

                       corner in this whole town. It was
                       riddled with drugs, prostitution,
                       and gang violence. It was
                       nicknamed 'The Crossroads.'

                       That's right, but myself and the
                       other officers worked on cleaning
                       it up for years so that the good

                       wouldn't have to worry about being

          Ronnie   opens the door and gets out of the car. As he
          exits,   a car drives by BLARING RAP MUSIC. The passenger
          throws   a beer bottle at Ronnie. He dodges it and the

          Ronnie is shaken, but he waves to Detective Harrison like
          he's okay. Detective Harrison waves back, then PEELS OUT
          OF THERE. Ronnie is confused.

                       Do it, man.
          
          Gang Member #1 puts the gun right up to Ronnie's head.

                       Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die.
                       Don't let me die, don't do it!
          
          Ronnie goes down on his knees.

          Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod.
          He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick.
          Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins
          dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast
          precision.
          
          Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja.
          Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker
          punch, busting his nose wide open.
          
          Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight
          with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass.
          Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping
          Ronnie.
          
          Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He
          takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins
          beating him senseless.
          
          SLOW MOTION: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the
          pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal
          and also at his best.

                       same thing. This guy is without a

          All of a sudden, Ronnie comes in all beaten and bruised.

          BAD-ASS PHYSICAL EXAM MONTAGE - INT. TRAINING FIELD -
          DAY
          
          SPRINT: The TESTING OFFICER blows a whistle and starts
          the 100 meter dash. Ronnie jumps off the starting line
          and hauls ass down the track. The other Trainees fall
          behind Ronnie as he smokes their asses.
          
          PULL-UPS: Ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull-
          up after pull-up.
          
          SIDE SLIDE: The Testing Officer blows a whistle and
          Ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater
          that never moves forward.
          
          SIT-UPS:     Ronnie goes hard on the sit-ups.
          
          OBSTACLE COURSE: Ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to
          the other side. He charges a body of water, then jumps
          onto the rope and swings safely to the other side.

          All the lights are off and we see the dark shadow creep
          through the darkness.
          
          The shadow breaks into the SHOE STORE and grabs as many           
          pairs of sneakers that it can carry. The shadow opens             
          the sliding cage and closes it from the other side. Then          
          bends down and locks it.

                       now in preparation for this day.                    
                       The kid kind of looks up to me.                     
                       I'm some what of a big brother to                   
                       the little guy.                                     
          
          Charles kind of looks at Ronnie like he's crazy.

                       Alright, it's actually not a bad                    
                       idea. It might make our Security                    
                       more visible so we can give people                  
                       the illusion that we're on top of                   
                       this.

                       Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if                    
                       this crime doesn't come to an end                   
                       pretty soon, we're gonna have to                    
                       let someone go. I mean, you've                      
                       always done a great job for me,                     
                       but the truth is, someone is going                  
                       to have to take the fall. You're                    
                       the one who wanted to be Head of

                       just bought my wife a new                           
                       Cadillac, so let's just say it                      
                       won't be me.

          darts across the parking lot.                                    
          
          Ronnie follows Brandi's path and tries to catch up with          
          her.

          Ronnie drives around, but he can't find Brandi anywhere.         
          
          Ronnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the            
          parking lot. He pulls his golf cart over and climbs out.         
          
          Ronnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window.             
          Inside, Ronnie sees Brandi and Detective Harrison banging        
          like a couple of wild animals.                                   
          
          Ronnie jumps back in shock!

          Detective Harrison looks out of the window. He doesn't            
          see anything. He climbs back on top of Brandi.

          watches. The images shine COLOR on him, but Ronnie is in     
          his own world.

          Ronnie has the Special Elite Task Force assembled.

                    Hey, Ronnie, that's crazy talk.                    
                    Are you cool?

                    No, I'm not cool, Charles. In
                    fact, shit is seriously fucked up.
                    I've got to protect the whole mall
                    by myself. Now, I got you this
                    fucking job, when are you going to
                    stop being a little baby and do
                    something for a change.

                    it, buddy!
          
          Ronnie puts his head on the table.

                    You know, Dennis, for the longest
                    time I made this job my whole
                    life. I looked at this mall as a
                    kingdom and I looked at Mark as
                    the King. I thought of myself as
                    the first Knight and the
                    customers, well, they were the
                    peasants. I lived by an old code
                    where one was bound by duty and
                    honor. But now I don't know if I
                    believe in that code anymore.
                    I've lost my way. Now I just feel
                    like it's one big kingdom of shit.
                    Right now, I got half a mind just                  
                    to let this whole place burn.                      
                    Burn it to the fucking ground!

          Dennis stares down at the desk. Dennis takes off his hat
          and reveals that he has bleached white Eminem hair
          underneath. Next, he reaches under his collar and flips
          out a thin gold necklace. He kicks up his shoes and
          reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks.
          
          This is the REAL DENNIS and for the first time ever, he

                       look at this mall as a Kingdom?!
                       Shit! I look at this place like a
                       motherfucking jail sentence. You
                       put on that uniform every morning,

                       I can show you the way, but you've
                       got to be willing to accept it. So
                       I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are
                       you ready for a trip to the other side?

          Dennis and Ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the
          dumpsters. Dennis sucks down a fat joint. He passes it
          to Ronnie.
          
                                     DENNIS
                       So, yeah, usually I take a joint
                       straight to the head before I
                       start work in this motherfucker,
                       but on really stressful days, I
                       like to get drunk too.
          
          Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is
          still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and
          begins violently coughing. He finally stops.

                       perv out on girls for about an
                       hour or two. I hooked up twice
                       last week. One was this Asian
                       chick and the other was this mom.
                       She wasn't that hot, but what else
                       do I got to do?
          
          Two high school girls walk by.

                       Dressing rooms are a great place
                       to hide out, because nobody is
                       really going to think of looking
                       for me here. You can nap or just
                       kind of hang out and just really
                       have some personal time. Hey,
                       hand me that camera.
          
          Ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis.
          
                                     DENNIS
                       Thanks, Ronnie.
          
          Dennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other
          changing room. The two high school girls are changing
          into other clothes. Dennis starts taking pictures of
          them without them knowing.

          Charles tries to grab Ronnie, but Ronnie pushes him off.          
          Ronnie knocks the framed pictures off of the wall. He
          then opens the door and slams it into the wall over and
          over again. That does nothing. Ronnie tries to rip the
          cushion on the chair. He looks ridiculous.

          Ronnie stops and begins to cry.     Then he runs out of the
          office in tears.

          TIME LAPSE: The sun rises and sets three times through
          the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days
          have passed. The whole time, Ronnie doesn't move from
          his bed.

          Ronnie gets on his "nice" clothes, but they're a far cry

          Ronnie's Mom leaves and Ronnie looks at himself in the           
          mirror. Then something catches his eye. Ronnie sees a            
          newspaper laying on the ground. He picks it up and               
          reads.

          to a prisoner on the opposite side of a Plexiglas                
          divider. Ronnie sits down in wait. Then, two GUARDS              
          appear escorting a handcuffed Dennis. Dennis takes a

                    there aren't any jobs where you                      
                    can avoid hard choices. Anyway,

          Ronnie is stunned. With one kiss, Nell seems to make              
          everything okay. They stare at each other and the moment

          THE PERVERT
          
          has made his way through the whole mall at this point,
          but Ronnie is right on his ass. The Pervert is heading
          toward the DEPARTMENT STORE.
          
          
          INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
          
          The Pervert comes barreling in and the ladies at the
          perfume and make-up counters SCREAM.
          
          He looks like he's charging straight at Brandi.    He's         
          getting closer.
          
          BOOM! Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the
          Pervert with the flashlight. Ronnie jumps on top of the
          Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him. This is
          a vision of a man leaving all out on the field.
          
          Ronnie stops pounding and looks up. He sees Brandi              
          staring at him. Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on
          the Pervert harder than ever before. Finally, Charles           
          comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him.
          
          A huge crowd has gathered around. Ronnie has blood all
          over him. Ronnie picks the Pervert up and holds him
          tightly by the arms. Mark comes running up.
          
                                     CHARLES

          orange golf cart on a city street with a Pervert chained
          up beside him, but Ronnie could care less.

          The golf cart pulls up to the police station and Ronnie
          gets out with the Perv. Ronnie walks up the front steps
          and all of the officers part and let him through.

                       Well, being a mall security guard
                       basically requires the same skill
                       set that someone in say the FBI
                       has. You have to use logic and
                       evidence and old-fashioned common
                       sense as well as the latest
                       technology to deduce the criminal
                       mind. It's what I do.
          
          All of a sudden, STEVIE AND THE SKATERS come up behind            
          Ronnie. They look into the camera lens and start                  
          smiling. Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to

                       THAT'S IT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!

          THE SKATERS jump on their skateboards and skate off.            
          Ronnie runs after them. He jumps into his GOLF CART and         
          gives chase.

    OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01


    FADE IN:


1   EMPTY ROOM WITH SINGLE CHAIR                                  1

    We hear a DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, followed by APPROACHING
    FOOTSTEPS. DANNY OCEAN, dressed in prison fatigues,
    ENTERS FRAME and sits.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
               Good morning.

                               DANNY
               Good morning.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               Please state your name for the
               record.

                               DANNY
               Daniel Ocean.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose
               of this meeting is to determine
               whether, if released, you are
               likely to break the law again.
               While this was your first
               conviction, you have been
               implicated, though never charged,
               in over a dozen other confidence
               schemes and frauds. What can you
               tell us about this?

                             DANNY
               As you say, ma'am, I was never
               charged.


2   INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING         2

    Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a
    table.

                             BOARD MEMBER #2
               Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to
               find out is: was there a reason
               you chose to commit this crime, or
               was there a reason why you simply
               got caught this time?

                             DANNY
               My wife left me. I was upset.    I
               got into a self-destructive
               pattern.

                               BOARD MEMBER #3
                 If released, is it likely you
                 would fall back into a similar
                 pattern?

                               DANNY
                 She already left me once. I don't
                 think she'll do it again just for
                 kicks.

    Glances dart between the Board Members.

                               BOARD MEMBER #1
                 Mr. Ocean, what do you think you
                 would do if released?

    Danny considers.

                               DANNY
                        (deadpan)
                 I don't know. How much do you
                 guys make a year?


3   INT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - CHECK-OUT STATION - DAY         3

                                  GUARD #2
                 Ocean, Daniel.

    Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions
    and a form certifying their return to Danny.

                                  GUARD #2
                 Sign.
                        (adding a piece of
                          mail to the pile)
                 This came today for you. Rest'll
                 be forwarded to your parole
                 officer.

                               GUARD #1
                        (reading its return
                         address over Danny's
                         shoulder)
                 Those your lawyers?

                                  DANNY
                 My wife's.

    He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers
    within, he smirks just a little.

                                  GUARD #1
                 What's it say?

3    CONTINUED:                                                    3

                                DANNY
                  I'm a free man.


4    INT. CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4

     Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare
     thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The
     old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver
     wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?


5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5

     A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY
     CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it:
     "If you were in prison, you'd be home now."

     The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its
     frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you
     notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)

     He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of
     freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of
     the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New
     Jersey):    Life is hard out there.

     But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
     into free America...


A6   EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK                           A6

     Any empty wintery boardwalk.


6    INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT                           6

     ... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
     carpeting.

     As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we
     hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of
     CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK
     from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.

     And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
     and a snifter of brandy. He's home.


     ON DANNY'S WALLET

     As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on
     green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of
     chips.

                                                             4.

7   AT BLACKJACK TABLE                                            7

    Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for
    someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but
    without success. He turns his attention back to his
    cards, and the cards of the dealer.

    Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins.
    King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts.
    Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.

    A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes
    him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was
    scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar
    face is welcome.

                               DANNY
              Hello, Frank.

    The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and
    his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's
    dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He
    quickly hides his astonishment.

                            FRANK
              I beg your pardon, sir. You must
              have me confused with someone
              else. My name is Ramon. See?

    He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is
    the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit
    boss circles close by and glares at them both.

                            DANNY
              My mistake...
                     (collecting his chips,
                      doubled)
              Table's cold anyway.

                            FRANK
              You might try the lounge at the
              Grand, sir. It gets busy around
              one.

                               DANNY
                        (as he goes)
              Thanks.


8   INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND                                          8

    Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around
    him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon,
    folds back the New York Times and scans.

    His eyes move down the page and stop at a header --
    "Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces
    Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...

    The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of
    the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely
    visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former
    owner, Reuben Tishkoff.

                               FRANK (O.S.)
                 Catching up on current events?

    Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him,
    changed out of his dealer's threads.

                               DANNY
                 Ramon?

                               FRANK
                 Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
                 wouldn't get by the gaming board.
                        (beat)
                 You just out?

                               DANNY
                 This afternoon.

                               FRANK
                        (re: Danny's drink
                         and whereabouts)
                 And already turning over a new
                 leaf.

    Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.

                               DANNY
                        (directly, this is
                         why he's here)
                 You seen him?

                               FRANK
                 Last I heard he was in L.A.
                 Teaching movie stars how to
                 play cards.
                        (beat)
                 Why? You don't have something
                 planned already?

                                DANNY
                 You kidding? I just became a
                 citizen again.

    Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye,
    and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has.

     MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.

                                FRANK
                  It's tough now, our line of work.
                  Everybody so serious. Too many
                  guns, too many computers. Whadda
                  you gonna do? Steal from ordinary
                  people?

                                DANNY
                  That would be criminal.

                                FRANK
                  So what's left? Banks? Hah.
                  Banks got no money. It's all
                  electronic. Only place that still
                  takes cash is...

                  Casinos.

                                FRANK
                         (realizing)
                  Oh, no...

                                 DANNY
                  Oh, yes...

                                 FRANK
                  When?

                                 DANNY
                  Soon.   Interested?

     Frank smiles.    Danny has his answer.


10   INT. SUB SHOP - FOYER - NIGHT                                  10

     Danny pulls a business card from his jacket, picks up the
     phone again, and dials the card's number.

                                 DANNY
                   Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is
                   Danny Ocean. I'm just out, I'm
                   supposed to check in with you
                   within twenty-four hours.
                          (listens)
                   No, sir, I haven't gotten into
                   any trouble. No drinking, no sir.
                          (listens, finishes

                   Hey, I don't know if you're, uh,
                   you know, incorporated or anything,
                   like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know,
                   incorporated, but you should think
                   about it, really, 'cause I was
                   talking to my manager yesterday --

                   that Bernie, my business manager,
                   he's also Bernie, he was telling
                   me that since this, what we do,
                   could be considered research for,
                   you know, a future gig, that I
                   should be able to write it off as
                   a business expense. So he suggested
                   that it'd be better if I wrote you
                   a check, and thereby --

      Rusty looks at him:     are you stoned?

      Hollywood nightclubbers.

                   Alright.   Who's here?

                   Josh is here. Seth is here.
                   David couldn't make it. He's got
                   two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania
                   because somebody just figured out
                   forty percent of the budget is
                   coming from Germany.

                                 RUSTY
                   That's a problem.

                   Barry is here.

                                 RUSTY
                   I thought they let him out to do
                   that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.

                                 TOPHER
                   Couldn't work the dates. Oh, and
                   he brought his girlfriend.

      Small but stylish.     Rusty enters, Topher in tow.

                                 RUSTY
                   Good evening, guys. Let's play
                   some cards...

      A glance at the table reveals: the three waiting players
      are all young TV stars (Josh Jackson, Seth Green, Barry
      Watson) here for a group poker lesson with Rusty. (One
      star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, Katie, also
      a known actress, to observe.)

      A glance back at Rusty reveals:     he's in for a long
      night.

                                 RUSTY
                   ... and let's play some cards.

      The group lesson has begun.

                           over)
                   Ah, what the hell. Pocket

      Rusty leans into Topher's ear, whispering:

                   Why you bet a certain way is your

                   them think you're betting for a

                   One McCallum neat. And four
                   bottled waters.

      Rusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a
      poker table.

                                 SETH
                          (triumphantly)
                   Two pair -- nines and twos.

      Rusty checks his hand:     a full-house full of face cards.

                   Cool, man!

      Behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light-
      district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued
      expression in their reflection. Then, out the corner
      of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through
      the pulsating crowd. Someone familiar to him. He
      follows.

      from their steely glares across the table, not a happy
      one.

                                 DANNY
                   Well, that's all behind us now.

                                 RUSTY
                   I should hope so.

      Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls
      out his wallet.

                                 DANNY
                   I raise you five hundred dollars.

      A hush in the room. Danny has thrown down the gauntlet.
      He and Rusty hold each other's stares.

                                  RUSTY
                   Guys: Day One: what's the first
                   rule of poker?

                BARRY                      TOPHER
        Um, never bet on, uh, on           'Leave emotion at the
        a --                               door.'

                                  RUSTY
                   That's right. My friend here just
                   raised me out of pique.
                          (beat)
                   Today's lesson. How to draw out
                   a bluff. This early in the game,
                   that much money, I'm thinking he's
                   holding nothing better than a pair
                   of face cards.
                          (beat)
                   Seth, raise him.

                                SETH
                   Okay. Uh, your five hundred and...
                   another two?

      Rusty nods, and Seth pushes in his chips.

                                  RUSTY
                   Tophe...

                                  TOPHER
                   Seven to me.   Plus three.   What
                   the hell.

                                 RUSTY
                   Indeed. But be careful you don't
                   push him too high too fast. Want
                   to keep him on the leash. I call.

      It's Josh's turn.       He hesitates...

                                 JOSH
                   What's that to me? A thousand?

                                 RUSTY
                   All you have to do is call.

                                 DANNY
                          (off Josh's further
                           hesitation)
                   What? Your girlfriend holding
                   your purse?

      That does it. Josh is in. The bet's to Danny. He
      checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.

                                 DANNY
                   Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say,
                   Seth, I always check my cards
                   before I make a bet. But be
                   cafeful. I could tell from your
                   face you're holding three of a
                   kind or better.
                          (digging his wallet
                           out)
                   Five hundred to call. And two
                   grand more.

      Danny stares Rusty down.      The others look a little pale.

                                 RUSTY
                   Guys, you're free to do what you
                   like. It's a lot of money. But
                   I'm staying in. He's trying to
                   buy his way out of his bluff.

      Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to
      leave a grand on the table, either. Finally, Seth
      ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.

                                   RUSTY
                   We call.

      Danny sets down his hand. Four nines. It's a winner.
      The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. For the
      first time tonight, Rusty blanches.

                   Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was
                   sure he was bluffing.

      As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys
      around him, Danny rakes in his pot.

                                 DANNY
                   Thanks for the game, fellas.
                          (then)
                   Hey, I hate to ask this, but
                   could you sign something for me?
                   It's for the guys in the joint.
                   They just love all your shows.

A16   EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT                               A16

      A queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as Topher and
      company exit, and they begin signing autographs. Danny
      and Rusty exit, too, but of course nobody gives a shit
      about them.


16    INT. RUSTY'S FALCON - MOVING - NIGHT                             16

      Danny and Rusty ride silently, staring out opposite
      windows at Sunset Boulevard.

                                 RUSTY
                   That was, that was just...

                                 DANNY
                   Unprofessional.

      Rusty agrees.

                                 RUSTY
                   How was the clink? You get the
                   cookies I sent you?

                                 DANNY
                   Why do you think I came to see you
                   first?

      Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off
      half, and hands it to Rusty.

                                  DANNY
                   Ten grand.   Half of it's yours.

17   INT. CANTER'S DELI - NIGHT                                        17

     They're sitting in a booth over coffee.

                                    RUSTY
                  How's Tess?

     Danny stares at him:       next subject, please.

                                 RUSTY
                  Alright.   Tell me.

                               DANNY
                  It's tricky. No one's ever done
                  it before. Needs planning, a
                  large crew.

                                    RUSTY
                  Guns?

                                DANNY
                  Not loaded ones. It has to be
                  very precise. There's a lot of
                  security. But the take...

                                RUSTY
                  What's the target?

                                DANNY
                  Eight figures each.

                                    RUSTY
                  What's.    The.    Target.

                  When's the last time you were in

                  What? You wanna knock over a
                  casino?

     Danny puts down his coffee. And shakes his head. And
     lifts three fingers: three casinos. Rusty must put down
     his coffee, too.

     It's after hours downtown.    Dark, empty, dead...


19   INT. LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT               19

     Lights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces:     J.A.
     KUEHN & ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS.

     Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant
     offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance.
     As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty
     passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to
     its out box.

     At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and
     drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.

                                DANNY
                  The vault at the Bellagio.

     A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another
     underneath it.

                                RUSTY
                  If I'm reading these right -- and
                  I think that I am -- this is
                  probably the least accessible
                  vault ever designed.
                         (beat)
                  Oops. Actually, you know what,
                  I'm wrong. It's definitely the
                  least accessible vault ever
                  designed.

                                DANNY
                  Yep.

     Rusty's brow furrows just a little.

                  Yes, they are.     Think he'll mind?

     No ding. The elevator just arrives. Its doors part to
     reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a
     large fellow, he has to duck to exit.

     As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers
     the plan (which, in our absence, Danny has pitched him).

                                RUSTY
                  You'd need at least a dozen guys,

                  Well, off the top of my head, I'd
                  say you're looking at a Boesky, a
                  Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two
                  Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh,
                  and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald

                  So, here's what I think: You
                  should take this plan, kick it
                  around for a week or two. Sleep
                  on it. Turn it over in your head.
                  Then: never bring it up to me
                  again.

                                  DANNY
                  Uh-huh.    So what are you saying?

                                RUSTY
                  I'm saying: this is like trying
                  to build a house of cards on the
                  deck of a speeding boat.

                                DANNY
                  Really? I thought it was much
                  harder than that --

     Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them
     square in the eyes. Danny and Rusty put their hands up
     to block the light.

                                DANNY
                  Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little,
                  will ya?

                  You two done up here?    Find what
                  you wanted?

                                DANNY
                  Yeah, thanks. You mind if we
                  borrow a couple drawings for the
                  night? Make some copies.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Whatever you need.

     Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple
     hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard's hand.

                                   DANNY
                  'Preciate it.


24   AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY                                      24

     Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator. When its doors
     open, Rusty stops Danny from boarding.

                                RUSTY
                  I need a reason. And don't say
                  money.
                         (beat)
                  Why do this?

                                   DANNY
                  Why not do it?

     Rusty stares at him:    enough bullshitting around.

                                DANNY
                  Because yesterday I walked out of
                  the joint wearing my entire
                  wardrobe and you're colddecking
                  TeenBeat coverboys.
                         (beat)
                  Because the house always wins.
                  You play long enough, never
                  changing stakes, the house takes
                  you. Unless, when that special
                  hand comes around, you bet big.
                  And then you take the house.

     A beat.   Rusty smiles.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                  You're been practicing that
                  speech, haven't you?

                                DANNY
                  A little. Did I rush it?   It felt
                  like I rushed it.

                                RUSTY
                  No, it was good.

     They step aboard the elevator.     As the door closes:

                                RUSTY
                  I wonder what Reuben will say?

     Danny and Rusty look at each other.

                                TISHKOFF (V.O.)
                  You're out of your goddamn minds.


25   EXT. TISHKOFF'S OPULENT BACK YARD (LAS VEGAS) - DAY             25

     REUBEN TISHKOFF, the grimace of a man in mid-movement,
     forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch
     guests (Danny and Rusty) at his poolside.

                                 TISHKOFF
                  Are you listening to me? You are,
                  both of you, nuts. I know more
                  about casino security than any man
                  alive. I invented it, and it
                  cannot be beaten. They got
                  cameras, they got watchers, they
                  got locks, they got timers, they
                  got vaults. They got enough armed
                  personnel to occupy Paris. Okay,
                  bad example...

                                DANNY
                  It's never been tried.

                                 TISHKOFF
                  Oh, it's been tried. A few guys
                  even came close. You know the
                  three most successful robberies in
                  Vegas history?


26   FLASHBACK - INT. SANDS CASINO FLOOR (1965)                      26

     An Adlai Stevenson-lookalike approaches a lockbox carrier
     from behind and snatches the box.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     He takes almost three steps before five security men leap
     at him and -- FREEZE FRAME on his wide-eyed expression of
     horror...

                                TISHKOFF (V.O.)
                  Number three. The bronze medal.
                  Pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the
                  Sands. He got two steps closer to
                  the door than any living soul
                  before him.

     RESUME ACTION: Adlai Stevenson gets a taste of what NFL
     quarterbacks experience every Sunday... five fold.


27   INT. FLAMINGO CASINO FLOOR (1971)                               27

     A hippie races toward the electronic sliding doors,
     clutching a tray full of chips, and as the doors begin to
     part for him -- FREEZE FRAME: A billy club appears out
     of nowhere...

                                TISHKOFF (V.O.)
                  Second most successful robbery.
                  The Flamingo '71. This guy
                  actually smelled fresh oxygen
                  before they got him.

     RESUME ACTION: The billy club comes down -- whap! --
     across the hippie's skull and it's Chicago '68 all over
     again.

                                TISHKOFF (V.O.)
                  Course, he was breathing out of a
                  hose the next three weeks, goddamn
                  hippie.

                  And the closest any man has gotten
                  to robbing a Las Vegas casino...


29   FLASHBACK - EXT. CAESAR'S PALACE ENTRANCE (1987)                29

     Tourists and valets scatter as a Euro-thief (pastel
     T-shirt beneath a white linen suit) bursts from the
     casino and takes five steps before -- FREEZE FRAME:
     GLASS EXPLODES from three different doors behind him and
     he arches his back in agony...

                                TISHKOFF
                  Outside of Caesar's in '87.   He
                  came, he grabbed, he got
                  conquered.

     RESUME ACTION: BULLETS rip the man to shreds and he
     collapses on Caesar's steps a bloody pulp.


30   EXT. REUBEN TISHKOFF'S BACK YARD - DAY (PRESENT)                30

                                TISHKOFF
                  But what am I saying? You guys
                  are pros, the best. I'm sure you
                  can make it out of the casino. Of
                  course, lest we forget, once
                  you're out the front door, you're
                  still in the middle of the fucking
                  desert!

     Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.

                                RUSTY
                  You're right.
                         (to Danny)
                  He's right.

                                DANNY
                  Reuben, you're right. Our eyes
                  are bigger than our stomachs.

                                RUSTY
                  That's exactly it. Pure ego.

                                TISHKOFF
                  Yeah yeah blah blah.

                                DANNY
                  Thank you so much for setting us
                  straight. Sorry we bothered you.

     They both rise to go.

                                TISHKOFF
                  Look, we all go way back. I owe
                  you from that thing with the guy
                  in the place, and I'll never
                  forget it.

                                DANNY
                  It was our pleasure.

                                RUSTY
                  I'd never been to Belize.

                  Give Dominic your addresses, I got
                  some remaindered furniture I wanna
                  send you.

     Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave.
     Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily.

                                TISHKOFF
                  Just out of curiosity, which
                  casinos did you geniuses pick to
                  rob?

     Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this
     question, which of course he has.

                                DANNY
                  The Bellagio, Mirage, and the
                  M.G.M. Grand.

                         (nostrils flared,
                           smelling a rat)
                  Those are Terry Benedict's
                  casinos.

                                RUSTY
                  Say, you know, he's right.

     Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed
     cocktail.

                                TISHKOFF
                  You guys... Whadda you got against
                  Terry Benedict?

                                DANNY
                  What do you have against him?
                  That's the real question.

                                TISHKOFF
                  He torpedoed my casino, muscled me
                  out, now he's gonna blow it up
                  next month to make way for another
                  fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I
                  don't see what you're doin'.

                  That's why we've got to be very
                  careful. We have to be precise.
                  We have to be well-funded.

                                TISHKOFF
                  Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And
                  you're gonna need a crew as nuts

                  Who do you have in mind?

     Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish.

                  Frank C. has developed a bad case

     CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its
     ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross
     it. Now take a step back...

     That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off
     the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper.
     It's a remote-controlled toy.

     The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an
     actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track
     at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race.

     The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the
     wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote
     control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really.
     Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.

                             RUSTY (V.O.)
               I talked to the Malloys yesterday.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
               The Mormon twins?

                             RUSTY (V.O.)
               They're both in Salt Lake City,
               six months off the job. I got the
               sense they're having trouble
               filling the hours.

     Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK
     COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead.
     It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he
     jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his
     brother's vehicle.

     Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.

                                DANNY (V.O.)
               Electronics?

34   INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY                                  34

     On a black and white monitor: Two mobsters, on a meet in
     a public park, peer over their shoulders, making certain
     no one is watching them. Little do they know...

     ... LIVINGSTON DELL, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a
     continual flop sweat, crouches before their image,
     masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a
     joystick in his left hand. He is flanked by FBI MEN.

35   EXT. SANTA MONICA BOARDWALK - LATER                               35

     Livingston walks down the boardwalk. A rollerblader with a
     dog on a leash approaches and Livingston gets caught
     between the two. As he struggles to untangle himself from
     the leash...

     the explosives expert. A pair of goggles over his eyes
     reflects a match being struck, then touched to a fuse.

                                BASHER
                  Sweet...

     BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around;
     Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. As the dust
     settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into
     (what the settling fog now reveals to be) a dynamited
     bank vault. ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news.

                                BASHER
                         (to the rest of his

38   EXT. BANK - ONE MINUTE LATER                                   38

     The men exit through the front doors, their hands over
     their heads, Basher trailing them. Policemen and SWAT
     members encircle the group, weapons trained on them,
     chock full of instructions.


39   EXT. POLICE CAR - LATER                                        39

     Basher sits in the rear, handcuffed behind his back, feet
     on the pavement. An explosives COP kneels in front of
     him.

                  And that's all you used during the
                  event? Nothing else?

                                BASHER
                  Are you accusing me of booby-
                  trapping?

                                COP
                  Well, how 'bout it?

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                  Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.

     The Cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is
     Rusty, in a dark suit and shades.

                                RUSTY
                  Isn't that right, Basher?

                                  BASHER
                  That's right.

                         (flashing badge,
                          briefly)
                  Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a
                  guess. A simple G4 mainliner,
                  double-coil, backwound, quick
                  fuse with a drag under 20 feet.
                         (off Cop's reaction)
                  That's our man. Tell me something
                  else. Have you checked him for
                  booby traps on his person? I mean
                  really checked, not just for
                  weapons...

     The Cop looks bewildered. Rusty steps forward, yanks
     Basher onto his feet, spins him around. He moves his
     hands up and down Basher's legs, around his waist, under
     his arms.

                                RUSTY
                  Will you go find Griggs and tell
                  him I need to see him?

                  Done.   Thirty seconds all right?

                  Now.


40   MOVING WITH RUSTY AND BASHER                                40

     They're hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars,
     a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.

                                 RUSTY
                  Ten seconds?

                                 BASHER
                  Not quite.   Is Danny here?

                                RUSTY
                  Around the corner.

                                BASHER
                  Be good working with professionals
                  again.
                         (beat)
                  Okay: go.

     And they both start running.

                                RUSTY
                  Everyone down! Get down!      There's
                  a bomb in the...

     And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG! A
     collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks,
     cops hit the ground and cover their heads. Rusty and
     Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs
     like tires on an obstacle course. By the time the
     Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they've
     both disappeared.

     The Chinese National Circus, currently on tour in the
     Western United States. Trapeze artists, gymnastic teams,
     and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and
     swing through the air.

     A full house applauds every feat. Danny and Rusty sit in
     the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on
     spindles of cotton candy. Tough guys in toyland.

     impressed.

     SAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket
     patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out
     money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his
     tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves
     off...


45   THROUGH TRACK LOBBY                                             45

     Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as
     Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul
     disappears into the tunnel, he moves.

     Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps
     under the box seats. He produces an orange from his
     pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes
     appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but
     doesn't turn around.

                                SAUL
                  I saw you in the paddock before
                  the second race, outside the men's
                  room, when I placed my bet. I saw
                  you before you even got up this
                  morning.

                                RUSTY
                  How ya been, Saul?

                                  SAUL
                  Never better.

                                RUSTY
                  What's with the orange?

                                SAUL
                  My doctor says I need vitamins.

                                RUSTY
                  So why don't you take vitamins?

     For the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a
     look up at Rusty.

                  You come here to give me a
                  physical?

                                RUSTY
                  I got a box seat. Come on.


47   EXT. BOX SEATS - LATER                                         47

     A waiter serves coffee to Rusty and Saul.

                                RUSTY
                  I thought you drank bloody Mary's
                  at the track, Saul.

                                SAUL
                  A man shouldn't drink on the job.

                                RUSTY
                         (re: race)
                  Who we rooting for here?

                                 SAUL
                  Number four.

     There's the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and
     the dogs break out of the gate. From this point on
     Saul's eyes never leave the race.

                                SAUL
                  You gonna ask me? Or should I
                  just say no and get it over with?

                                RUSTY
                  Saul, you're the best there is.
                  You're in Cooperstown. What do
                  you want?

                                SAUL
                  Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I
                  got wall-to-wall and a goldfish,
                  I'm seeing a nice lady, she works
                  the unmentionables counter at
                  Macy's. I've changed.

                                RUSTY
                  Guys like us don't change, Saul.
                  We stay sharp or we get sloppy,
                  but we don't change.

                                SAUL
                  Quit connin' me.

     They watch the race.

                                RUSTY
                  That your hound way in the back
                  there?

                                SAUL
                  He breaks late. Everyone knows
                  this.

     On the track: The dogs are now coming around the back
     stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.

                                SAUL
                  You gonna treat me like a grownup
                  at least? Tell me what the scam
                  is?

     Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's
     ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around
     him people are standing and shouting.

     Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and
     walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish
     line... last by several lengths.

     Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of
     losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a
     ticket to Las Vegas.

                                DANNY (V.O.)
                  And Saul makes ten.


48   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                              48

     Danny and Rusty look weary from all this recruitment.   A
     nearby TV with the sound off plays a promo for an
     upcoming Tyson fight.

                                DANNY
                  Ten should do it, don't you think?
                         (as Rusty shrugs)
                  You think we need one more?
                         (as Rusty shrugs)
                  You think we need one more.
                         (as Rusty shrugs)
                  Okay. We'll get one more.


49   INT. CROWDED SUBWAY CAR (CHICAGO)                             49

     Native Chicagoans demonstrate their indigenous sixth
     sense -- L-car balance -- as the TRAIN bends and SHAKES
     at a corner.

     One passenger in particular keeps his footing, a young
     man in a frayed jacket: LINUS.

     Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to
     the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and
     consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at
     first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets.

     The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always
     forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his
     target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with
     incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with
     a flick of his thumb and forefinger.

     From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss,
     and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems...

     A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld,
     lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus.
     It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is
     aware of the ongoing heist.

     Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight,
     but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when
     the train hits another curve...

     ... he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on
     the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man
     of his wallet.

                                LINUS
                  Sorry 'bout that.

                                STOCKBROKER
                  No problem, guy.

     The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as
     Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face
     betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry
     performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his
     arm as...


50   INT. UNION STATION - SUBWAY STATION                            50

     ... The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop. Linus jumps out,
     leaving his prey aboard, and a few moments later, Danny
     steps off, too.


51   INT. UNION STATION - EVENING                                   51

     The hurly-burly of rush hour in Union Station.

     Commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious
     schedules, and Linus slips blithely through them, in no
     hurry, a man who's pulled this job a thousand times
     before.

     He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for
     a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times
     tucked under his arm), he escapes the station without
     incident.


52   EXT. UNION STATION - EVENING                                     52

     Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count
     his winnings. And his face falls.

     All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a
     calling card. On one side, in engraved printing:
     "DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice
     pull. Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division."


53   INT. MURPHY'S BAR - FIVE MINUTES LATER                           53

     On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk
     Guinness. Linus enters the front door, cases the joint,
     spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.

                                 DANNY
                  Hi, Linus.   Sit down.

                                 LINUS
                  Who are you?

                                DANNY
                  A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.   Sit
                  down.

     Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he
     sits.

                                DANNY
                  Bobby told me about you. Said you
                  were the best set of hands he ever
                  saw. Didn't expect to find you
                  working wallets on the subway.

                                LINUS
                  That wasn't work, that was
                  practice.

     Danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on
     the table. He keeps his hand over it.

                                DANNY
                  You're either in or out, right
                  now.

                                LINUS
                  What is it?

                                DANNY
                  A plane ticket. A job offer.

                                LINUS
                  You're pretty trusting pretty
                  fast.

                                DANNY
                  Bobby has every faith in you.

                                LINUS
                  Fathers are like that.
                         (off Danny's reaction)
                  He didn't tell you?
                         (as Danny shakes
                          his head)
                  He doesn't like me trading on his
                  name.

                                DANNY
                  You do this job, he'll be trading
                  on yours.

                                LINUS
                  What if I say no?

                                DANNY
                  We'll get someone else who won't
                  be quite as good. You can go back
                  to feeling up stockbrokers.

     Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at
     the wallet. It's one or the other.

     A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill.
     When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet
     remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone.
     Linus is reading it.

                                DANNY
                  That's the best lift I've seen you
                  make yet.

                                LINUS

     The city looms out of the desert like an infernal
     machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon
     fortress.

     One thing in particular catches our eye: an enormous
     billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match
     between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis. Below it, a
     promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call
     girls.

     Frank Catton is already here, mixing a drink, when --
     DING DONG -- the DOORBELL CHIMES. Tishkoff shuffles
     toward the front (he's given the help the night off) and
     opens his door to find...

                                LIVINGSTON
                  Trick or treat.

     ... Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus
     crowding his doormat. A taxi-van pulls away behind them.

                                TISHKOFF

                  probably haven't met Linus
                  Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid
                  outta Chicago.

     Linus trades nods around the room.

                                DANNY
                  Okay. Before we start, nobody's
                  on the line here yet. What I'm
                  about to propose to you happens to
                  be both highly lucrative and
                  highly dangerous. If that doesn't
                  sound like your particular brand
                  of vodka, help yourself to as
                  much food as you like and safe
                  journey. No hard feelings.
                         (pauses, soberly)
                  Otherwise, come with me.

     He turns and walks out of the living room, into another.
     Rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye
     over the assembled and keeps going. The guys look each
     other over, sizing things up.

     And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then
     Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus,
     watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find
     Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.

     A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here.
     Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of
     Terry Benedict's Las Vegas: three casinos and hotels
     with the Strip running between them.

     As the eleven surround the table and the model...

                                DANNY
                  Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las
                  Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known
                  as the Bellagio, the Mirage,
                  the M.G.M. Grand. Together,
                  they're the three most profitable
                  casinos in Las Vegas...

     Danny removes the Strip from the model. Revealed beneath
     is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each
     leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator
     shaft which descends into an enormous vault.

                                DANNY
                  Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault.
                  Located below the Strip, beneath
                  two hundred feet of solid earth.
                  It safeguards every dime that
                  comes through each of the three
                  casinos above it.
                         (beat)
                  And we're going to rob it.

     Everyone takes a breath, awed.

                                LINUS
                  Smash-and-grab job, huh?

                                RUSTY
                  It's a little more complicated
                  than that.

     Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of
     Tvs.

                  casinos.

     On the monitors: three montages of black-and-white
     security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages,
     moving into the tunnels, then (as the TVs unite in their
     images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the
     vault.

     As the group's glances shoot back and forth from the TV
     to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a
     POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...

                                  DANNY
                  Okay.    Bad news first. This place
                  houses   a security system which
                  rivals   most nuclear missile silos.
                  First:    we have to get within the
                  casino   cages --

                                RUSTY
                         (indicating)
                  -- here, here, and here --

                                DANNY
                  -- which anyone knows takes more
                  than a smile. Next: through
                  these doors, each of which
                  requires a different six-digit
                  code changed every twelve hours.
                  Past those lies the elevator, and
                  this is where it gets tricky: the
                  elevator won't move without
                  authorized fingerprint
                  identifications --

                                RUSTY
                  -- which we can't fake --

                                DANNY
                  -- and vocal confirmations from
                  both the security center within
                  the Bellagio and the vault below - -

                                RUSTY
                  -- which we won't get.

                                DANNY
                  Furthermore, the elevator shaft is
                  rigged with motion detectors --

                                RUSTY
                  -- meaning if we manually override
                  the lift, the shaft's exit will
                  lock down automatically and we'll
                  be trapped.

                                DANNY
                  Once we've gotten down the shaft,
                  though, then it's a walk in the
                  park: just three more guards with
                  Uzis and predilections toward not
                  being robbed, and the most
                  elaborate vault door conceived by
                  man. Any questions?

     Silence. For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen
     questions or more to himself. At last, one speaks up...

     The Amazing Yen.    In Cantonese.   Of course, no one
     understands him.    Except Rusty.

                                RUSTY
                         (in response)
                  No. Tunneling is out. There are
                  Richter scales monitoring the
                  ground for one hundred yards in
                  every direction. If a groundhog
                  tried to nest there, they'd know
                  about it. Anyone else?

     Another silence. Either the guys are too dumbfounded by
     that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead
     of them to speak.

                                TURK
                  You said something about good
                  news...

                         (smiles, happy
                          someone asked)
                  The Nevada Gaming Commission
                  stipulates: a casino must hold in
                  reserve enough cash to cover every
                  chip at play on its floor. As I
                  mentioned, this vault services
                  each of the three casinos above
                  it. That means: during the week,
                  by law, it must hold anywhere from
                  sixty to seventy million dollars
                  in cash and coin. On a weekend,
                  between eighty and ninety million.
                  On a fight night, like the one two
                  weeks from tonight, the night
                  we're going to rob it, at least a
                  hundred and fifty million. Without
                  breaking a sweat.
                         (gazing about room)
                  Now there are eleven of us. Each
                  with an equal share. You do the
                  math.

     MOVING AROUND the table ON ten faces, as everyone does
     precisely that, in their heads, except for Virgil who
     does it on his fingers. He whistles.

                                RUSTY
                  That's what I said.

                                 SAUL
                  I have a question.
                          (as Danny turns
                           to him)
                  Say we do get into the cage, and
                  through the security doors there,
                  and down the elevator we can't
                  move, and past the guards with
                  guns, and into the vault we can't
                  open...

                                RUSTY
                  Without being seen by the cameras.

                                DANNY
                         (off everyone's
                          astonishment)
                  Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to
                  mention that.

                                SAUL
                  Say we do all that. We're just
                  supposed to walk outta there with
                  a hundred million dollars in cash
                  on us without getting stopped?

     Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one
     Rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny
     now.

                                 DANNY
                  Yeah.

     Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has
     flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.

                                 DANNY

     light flashing red to green, admitting a guard into an
     "Employees Only" doorway.

     The Malloys, who've shadowed the guard here, note a
     sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security
     camera embedded in the ceiling above: No one walks

                  Most of all, I want you guys to
                  know these casinos. They were
                  built as labyrinths, to keep
                  people in. I want you guys to
                  know the quick routes out.

     Their job done, the Malloys start toward the casino's
     exit... in different directions. They begin to argue:
     The exit's that way -- no, it's that way.

     more technology.

     Apart from the fray, another bank of monitors manned by
     two watchers (let's call them, for no particular reason,
     FAT and SLIM) oversee a different section of the casino:
     the cage, its tunnels, the elevator, and the vault it
     leads to; everything, in fact, which our team saw in the
     game room.

               Third task: surveillance. Casino
               security has an eye and ear on
               everything, so we'll want an eye
               and ear on them. Livingston...

     SCHEMATICS OF BELLAGIO - NIGHT

     A page of the set Danny and Rusty "borrowed" from Kuehn &
     Associates. Danny and Livingston study it.


     WIDER

                             LIVINGSTON
               Well, it's not the least
               accessible system I've seen, but
               it's close. I don't suppose they
               have a closed-circuit feed I could
               tap into?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              46.

65   CONTINUED:                                                     65

     Danny shakes his head:     no such luck.

                                LIVINGSTON
                  Then this is definitely a black
                  bag job. Do they employ an in-
                  house technician?

     Danny looks to Rusty who, behind them, tampers with
     Livingston's audio-video setup: several portable
     monitors, a laptop and modem, telephone headset, etc.

                                 RUSTY
                  Two.   And one of them is lonely.

     DANCE MUSIC overwhelms the SOUNDTRACK...


66   INT. OLYMPIC GARDENS STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                        66

     ... as we join a lap dance already in progress. A
     security Technician (one of the two Frank eavesdropped on
     in the break room) shells out twenty bucks every three
     minutes for a DANCER to grind her pelvis against his
     chest...

     ... and while the Technician grins not-very-soberly and
     ogles her perfect breasts and paws at her midriff, the
     Dancer secretly removes the keycard from his belt.

                                 DANCER
                  I'll be right back, honey.    Don't
                  move a muscle.

                                TECHNICIAN

                          love)
                  Depends on the muscle.

     She pouts, flirtingly, as she does for every idiot who
     drops a line like that, then makes her way to...


67   EXT. OLYMPIC GARDENS STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                        67

     ... where Rusty waits for her, and when she slips him the
     keycard, he slips her a c-note.

                                RUSTY
                  Thanks, Charmaine. I'll have it
                  back within the hour.
                         (as he goes)
                  Say hello to your mom for me.

                                DANCER
                  Say it yourself. She'll be
                  onstage in five minutes.

                                                            47.

68   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                 68

     FOLLOWING a bunch of balloons -- all congratulating
     "Happy Anniversary!" -- as a delivery boy carries them
     through the casino, and just as he's passing an
     "Employees Only" door (complete with sentry and embedded
     ceiling camera)...

     ... he bumps into a TOURIST, and the balloons drift out
     of his hand and into the camera...

                             TOURIST
               Hey, watch it, bud...


69   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               69

     As the balloons fill the frame of one monitor...

                             SLIM
               433, we have visual impairment on
               the east door camera.


70   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                  70

     The SENTRY (#433) hears this and spots the balloons
     covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery
     boy (who by freak accident happens to be Virgil
     Malloy)...

                             SENTRY
               Excuse me, sir: You're going to
               have to move your balloons.

     ... but Virgil's too busy picking a fight with the
     Tourist (surprise, surprise: Turk Malloy) to listen.

                             VIRGIL
               Who you calling 'bud,' pal?

                             TURK (TOURIST)
               Who you calling 'pal,' friend?

                             VIRGIL
               Who you calling 'friend'...
                      (can't think of
                       another)
               ... bud...

     And with the Sentry out of position...

     ... Livingston (dressed now in a technician's uniform,
     don't worry about how he got it) goes quickly to the door
     and swipes the newly-acquired keycard and when it flashes
     red-to-green, he enters...

     OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                            48.

71   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                         71

     He's in. Livingston takes a moment, his brow perspiring
     (he's in the lions' den now), then checks his palm:
     drawn there in ballpoint is a diagram of the cage
     corridors.


72   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY - ON         72
     MONITOR NEXT TO BALLOON-CLOUDED ONE

     Livingston appears and, as nonchalantly as he can, he
     ambles down a hallway, then another, until he reaches...


73   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                         73

     ... an unmarked door next to the entrance to the security
     center. Livingston swipes his keycard to enter...


74   INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM                                         74

     A giant walk-in closet/switchboard full of wires, plugs,
     lights, etc. Livingston goes to work:


     FLURRY OF SHOTS

     He splices into all sorts of wires and lines and cables.
     Meanwhile...


75   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                 75

     ... Virgil and Turk argue, nose-to-nose, "accidentally"
     blocking the Sentry from the balloons...

                             VIRGIL
               You hear about this new medical
               discovery they made? It's called
               a 'sense of direction.'
               Apparently we're all supposed to
               have one...

                             TURK
               Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, balloon
               boy.

                             SENTRY
               Gentlemen, gentlemen...

                                                               49.

76   INT. CIRCUITRY ROOM                                             76

     Livingston's work here is almost done: he clips a small
     mechanism (known in his industry as a "spider" -- it's
     small, black, antenna-less and hides in dark places) to a
     main conduit, then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is
     picking up the spider's feed.

     One last click into place...


77   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  77

     ... causes a brief, unnoticed blip on Slim's monitors...


78   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM - NIGHT                       78

     ... and transmits all the views of the cages onto the
     monitors upstairs. Danny and Rusty witness their
     appearance.

                             DANNY
               Why do they paint hallways that
               color?

                             RUSTY
               They say taupe is very soothing.


79   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                             79

     Livingston steps outside. His job done, he exhales and
     wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for
     directions and...

     Whoops. His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. He's
     flying blind. He looks left down a corridor, then right,
     trying to remember which way he came from. No idea.


80   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM                               80

                             DANNY
               Uh-oh.


81   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                             81

     MOVING WITH Livingston as he tries to find his way out.
     He takes a left...

     Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead.    Livingston
     has no recourse but to march right by him.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                50.

81   CONTINUED:                                                       81

                                  FAT
                  Hiya.

                                  LIVINGSTON
                  Fine, thanks.

     Livingston continues on, and maybe for a second he thinks
     he's in the clear, especially when he sees the exit
     looming ahead, but then Fat turns behind him and hails
     him back...

                                  FAT
                  Hey...


82   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                      82

     At last, the Sentry outmaneuvers Virgil and Turk and
     grabs the balloons himself. Virgil quickly snatches them
     back...

                                VIRGIL
                  Hey... get your own balloons.


83   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                              83

     Livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his
     keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green.

                                  FAT
                           (on his tail)
                  Hey...

     Livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his
     keycard. He tries again. Red flashes to green. He
     pulls the door...

     ... but Fat blocks it.       Livingston peers up, certain he's
     had it.


84   INT. BELLAGIO - LIVINGSTON'S ROOM                                84

     Danny and Rusty simultaneously lean forward.


85   INT. CAGE - HALLWAY                                              85

                                FAT
                  You dropped this.

     Fat holds out Livingston's receiver and drops it in his
     hand.

     And he's out.

     The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools,
     paint, etc. -- and Yen hauls three times his share,
     carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus
     act in a hardware store.

88   EXT. BILLY TIM'S VAN AND TRUCK DEALERSHIP - OFFICE - DAY         88

     Outside a window: Turk and Virgil jump up and down on
     opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability.

     Inside, Frank negotiates with BILLY TIM, a Cal-
     Worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays
     attention to him, half-frets over the Malloys outside.

                                BILLY TIM
                  I'm sorry: eighteen-five each is
                  the best offer I can make you.

     Frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now
     is to force Billy Tim into lowering his price just to get
     Frank out of his office.

                                FRANK
                  I swear by it. I try all sorts of
                  lotions. I went through a
                  fragrance-free period last year,
                  but now I'm liking this new brand
                  fortified with rose hip. My
                  sister, you know, she uses the
                  aloe vera with the sun screen
                  built in...

                                BILLY TIM
                         (just can't get
                          his hand back)
                  Uh-huh. You said you'd be willing
                  to pay in cash?

                                FRANK
                  I did. You know: they say
                  cinnamon is wonderful for your
                  pores. Read that on the internet.
                  And that ideally you should be
                  wearing gloves to bed, but I find
                  that would interfere with my
                  social agenda. Problem is: I get
                  a reaction to camphor so I can't
                  use traditional remedies...

                                BILLY TIM
                  If you could pay cash, I could
                  probably drop the price a little.
                  To, say, seventeen...
                         (as Frank squeezes
                          a little)
                  ... sixteen each.

                                FRANK
                         (big smile)
                  That would be lovely.


89   INT. WAREHOUSE - BACK TO DANNY - DAY                           89

     overseeing the construction, reviewing his list of tasks
     on his fingers, suspecting he's missed one.

                                DANNY

                  Anything I can do?

     Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him,
     dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he
     missed.

                                DANNY
                  Get your wallet.


90   INT. HABERDASHERY                                              90

     A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money
     can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...

                                SAUL
                  This is nice material.

                                DANNY
                  It's Armani, Saul.

                                SAUL
                  It's very nice.

     Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to
     his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a
     moment."

                                DANNY
                  Saul, you sure you're ready to do
                  this?

     Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his
     entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes
     icicles.

                                SAUL
                  If you ever question me again,
                  Daniel, you won't wake up the
                  following morning.

     They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never
     waver.

                                  DANNY
                  You're ready.

     Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately
     slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices...

                                SAUL
                  Hello.  My name is Lyman Zerga...
                         (this time a little
                          deeper)
                  My name is Lyman Zerga...

                                                            55.

91   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                         91

     Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in
     Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on
     his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge
     of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even
     deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could
     be Scottish, could be Israeli...

                             SAUL
               My name is Lyman Zerga... My name
               is Lyman Zerga...

     Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.

                             DANNY
               There's a little over twenty grand
               there, Saul. Try to make it last.

     Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...

                                SAUL
               You seen my...

                             DANNY
                      (handing him Rolaids)
               Bought you a fresh roll.

     The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry
     of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and
     Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for
     him.

                             VIRGIL
               Mr. Zerga, we're here.

                             DANNY
               Good luck, Lyman.

                             SAUL
                      (hesitates, then gets
                       out)
               Luck is for losers.


92   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY                                   92

     Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance
     into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and
     trailing him. He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE...

                             V.I.P. CONCIERGE
               Good afternoon, sir. How can I be
               of service?

                   My name is Lyman Zerga.   I'd like
                   a suite, please.

                                 V.I.P. CONCIERGE
                   Do you have a reservation with us?

                                 SAUL
                          (long glare at him)
                   I don't make reservations.

      A longer glance at Lyman's bodyguards tells the Concierge
      this is not a man to be denied. As he jumps to it...


A93   INT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE - DAY                        A93

      Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit
      before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as
      they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.

                                  RUSTY
                   Okay.   Tell me about Benedict.

                                 LINUS
                   The guy is a machine.


93    EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                  93

      TERRY BENEDICT emerges from a Town Car and, from his
      haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless
      perfection. He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye
      contact to no man. He strides into his casino and,
      appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in.

                                 LINUS (V.O.)
                   He arrives at the Bellagio every
                   day at two p.m. Same Town Car,
                   same driver. Remembers every
                   valet's name on the way in. Not
                   bad for a guy worth three-quarters
                   of a billion.


94    INT. BELLAGIO - ELEVATOR BAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                94

      The doors open, and Terry Benedict steps out.     Linus
      watches from a craps table.

                                 LINUS (V.O.)
                   Offices are upstairs. He works
                   hard, hits the lobby floor at
                   seven on the nose.

95   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (SUPER SLOW MOTION)               95

     From a balcony, Benedict stands overlooking the casino
     floor. His CASINO MANAGER approaches and they confer.

                             LINUS (V.O.)
               Spends three minutes on the floor
               with his casino manager.

                             RUSTY (V.O.)
               What do they talk about?

                             LINUS (V.O.)
               All business. Benedict likes to
               know what's going on in his
               casinos. There's rarely an
               incident he doesn't know about
               or handle personally.


96   INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                    96

     Benedict works the room. He speaks to a Japanese High
     Roller in Japanese, to a Swiss in German, etc.

                             LINUS (V.O.)
               He spends a few minutes
               gladhanding the high rollers.
               He's fluent in Spanish, German and
               Italian, and he's taking Japanese
               lessons, getting pretty good at
               it. He's out by seven-thirty,
               when an assistant hands him a
               black portfolio. Contents: the
               day's take and new security codes.
               Then he heads to the restaurant.

     Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands
     him a black portfolio.

97   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - OUTSIDE RESTAURANT                      97

     Rusty and Linus watch the entrance:    No one enters.

                             LINUS
               Give him another ten seconds.

     Around the corner comes Benedict, carrying his black
     portfolio.

                              LINUS
               As I said:   a machine.

                             RUSTY
               And that portfolio contains the
               codes to all the cage doors?

                  I'll tell you: you guys picked
                  a helluva target. He is as smart
                  and ruthless as they come. The
                  last guy caught cheating here,
                  Benedict not only sent him up for
                  ten years, he got the bank to
                  seize the guy's home and
                  bankrupted --

                  He doesn't just go after your
                  knees, he goes after your
                  livelihood. And everyone-you-
                  ever-met's livelihood.

                                  RUSTY
                  You scared?

                                  LINUS

                  Only in the morning.
                         (beat)
                  Now what?

                                LINUS
                  Now comes the girl... if she comes
                  in after he does, that means
                  they're in a snit.

                                RUSTY
                  Where's she come from?

                                LINUS
                  The museum downstairs. She's the
                  curator there. Wait... here she
                  is. You'll like this.

     Rusty looks up as...

     ... a beautiful woman (the one Danny saw on Benedict's
     arm in the New York Times photo) appears. Elegantly
     dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own
     private space. And Rusty's face just about drops at the
     sight of her.

99    INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         99

      A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape.
      Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then
      matches its image (of Frank staple-gunning floorboard
      into place) to a security tape of the real McCoy.

      On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to
      work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and
      blow torches. Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil
      handles.

                              TISHKOFF
                This looks familiar. Where'd you
                get this?

                              VIRGIL
                Off your Rolls.

                Danny!   Tell 'em not to touch the
                Rolls!

      Overlooking the whole enterprise is Danny, grinning from
      ear to ear, happy in his work. He checks a stopwatch in
      his hand as...

      ... the false top to the cash cart before him flies open,
      revealing Yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded
      into a three-by-four foot space. He whips an air hose
      from his mouth and inhales deeply. Danny checks his
      watch.

                               DANNY
                29:47.   Everything okay in there?

      Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn't understand him.
      But Rusty does, appearing behind him.

                              RUSTY
                But what doesn't beat the shit out
                of being a circus performer?

      Danny turns to Rusty:    he looks very, very serious.


100   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         100

                                  DANNY
                   What is it?

                                 RUSTY
                   Tell me this isn't about her. Or
                   I'll walk off the job right now.
                          (off Danny's reaction)
                   Tess. She's with Terry Benedict
                   now. Tell me this isn't about
                   screwing the guy who's screwing
                   your wife.

                                  DANNY
                   Ex-wife.

                                  RUSTY
                   Tell me.

                                  DANNY
                   It's not.   About that.   Entirely.

      A beat.

                                 DANNY
                   You said you needed a reason.
                   Well, this is mine.
                          (beat)
                   When we started in this business,
                   we had three rules. We weren't
                   gonna hurt anybody. We weren't
                   gonna steal from anybody didn't
                   have it coming. And we were gonna
                   play the game like we had nothing
                   to lose. Well, I lost something.
                   Someone. That's why I'm here.

      A beat.

                                 RUSTY
                   Here's the problem: we're
                   stealing two things now. And when
                   push comes to shove, if you can't
                   have both, which are you gonna
                   choose? And remember: Tess
                   doesn't divide eleven ways.

      A beat.

                                 DANNY
                   If things go to plan, I won't be
                   the one who has to make that
                   choice.

      The two men stand quietly for a moment.

      CLOSE ON PICASSO'S WOMAN WITH GUITAR

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                   'Radiant' is the word. Absolutely
                   radiant.


101   INT. BELLAGIO ART GALLERY - DAY                                101

      The painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall
      between a van Gogh and a Monet.

      At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the
      seller's AIDE-DE-CAMP. A staff photographer and other
      personnel mill nearby.

      Off to the side, in a sharp blazer, Tess stands
      transfixed by the painting.

                                 TESS
                   He painted it in the summer of
                   1912, after the break-up with
                   Fernande Olivier.

                                 SELLER
                   She must have put him through
                   hell.

                                 TESS
                   You can see the conflict. He
                   makes her both erotic and
                   grotesque. He's hopelessly drawn
                   to her, and yet she drives him
                   crazy.

                                 AIDE-DE-CAMP
                          (checking his watch)
                   Mr. Santaniello has an early
                   flight. Do you think Mr. Benedict
                   will be late?

                                 TESS
                   Mr. Benedict is never late.

      Just then the double doors to the gallery swing open, and
      Terry Benedict enters, right on time.

      He is elegant, beaming, commanding.    All that's missing
      is a blare of trumpets.

                                  BENEDICT
                   Am I late?

                                 TESS
                   Not at all, Mr. Benedict.
                          (greeting him)
                   Allow me to introduce to you Mr.
                   Jean Santaniello.

                                 BENEDICT
                          (to Seller)
                   Mr. Santaniello, I apologize if I
                   kept you. I had to iron out a few
                   issues with my fight promoter. I
                   gave him an unlimited budget, and
                   he exceeded it.

                                 SELLER
                   I understand it's going to be a
                   hell of a fight.

                                  BENEDICT
                   We hope.

      Tess angles Benedict toward the painting.

                                  TESS
                   Here it is.

      Benedict moves toward the painting, and as he does he
      catches Tess in his glance, and his smile deepens. Then:

                                 BENEDICT
                   Magnificent! I've been following
                   her for fifteen years now. At
                   last I've made her a home.
                          (to Tess)
                   All the arrangements and so
                   forth...

                                  SELLER
                   Done.   She's yours.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Not mine. She belongs to everyone
                   who comes into my hotel. Isn't
                   that right, Ms. Ocean?

                   Yes, Mr. Benedict.

                                 BENEDICT
                   She's lovely, isn't she?
                          (as the Seller is
                           confused; Benedict
                           specifies painting)
                   I can't be the only one who was
                   after her.

                                 SELLER
                   You're the only one who met my
                   price.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Ah, but this... You can't put a
                   price on beauty. But I shouldn't
                   philosophize. I own casinos,
                   after all.

                                 AIDE-DE-CAMP
                   Can we get a quick shot? Mr.
                   Santaniello has a plane to catch.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Of course, of course.

      Tess understands: she is not to be part of the photo.
      Benedict and the Seller pose together and...

      Flash!

      The Seller exits with the Aide-De-Camp in tow. Benedict
      remains, enthralled by the painting. Tess appears beside
      him.

                                  TESS

                   I have some bad news from the

                   Mike Tyson will be wearing red on
                   Saturday night. Red trunks with a
                   white stripe.

                   And you, as I recall, will be
                   wearing a red Donna Karan? And
                   when the TV cameras pick us up in
                   the front row, that red dress...

                                   TESS
                   I see.

                                 BENEDICT
                   He's a charming man, but no one's
                   going to be watching him when they
                   can make a study of you. I've
                   asked Paolo to find three or four
                   things for you to try. I hope
                   you're not too disappointed.

      She is, but she buries it.

                                   BENEDICT
                   Are you sure?

      She nods, smiles faintly.

                                 BENEDICT
                   I'll see you tonight.

      Instinctively she leans in to kiss him.        He recoils ever
      so slightly.

                                   TESS
                   What?    We're alone.

      He lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling,
      over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there. She
      follows his look.

                                 BENEDICT
                   In my hotels, there's always
                   someone watching.

      But he kisses her anyway.

                                 TESS
                   I'll see you tonight.

      He glances once more on the Picasso as he moves away.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Actually, I do like it.

      And Tess remains, thinking:         he's rich, he's handsome and
      wooing, but is she happy?

       Quiet, elegant, tense. One table is operating only, in
       the corner, and at it Saul, as Lyman Zerga, furtively
       peels at the roll of Rolaids and slips one in his mouth.

                 I don't believe in weakness. It
                 costs too much. I don't believe
                 in questions, either.

      This shuts the High Roller up fast. Saul looks up from
      the table, just perceptibly, to spot Terry Benedict, on
      his way in, right on schedule. He approaches the PIT

                   vague, but I asked around. Word
                   is he deals primarily in arms.
                   One of the biggest.

                   Yessir.    That's why I don't doubt
                   it.

                                 BENEDICT
                   He's staying here?

                                 PIT BOSS
                   Checked in two nights ago, sir.
                   He's in the Mirador suite.

                                 BENEDICT
                   How's he doing?

                                  PIT BOSS
                   Up.   Almost forty grand.

                          (knowing he can't

      being so...

      starts to caress her arms.

                          (recognizing the hands,

                   I'm out.

                                 DANNY
                   Of prison. You remember. The day
                   I went for cigarettes and never
                   came back. You must have noticed.

                                  TESS
                   I don't smoke.

                   They said I'd paid my debt to

                                 TESS
                   Funny, I never got a check.

      Danny smiles.    Tess stares daggers.

                TESS                      DANNY
        You can't stay.                   It's good to see you.

                   You're not wearing your ring.

      A beat.

                                TESS
                   I sold it. And I don't have a
                   husband. Or didn't you get the
                   papers?

                                 DANNY

                   I told you I'd write.

      Danny reaches his hand (ringed) for hers (ringless), but
      she removes it from the table.

                                   TESS

                   Benedict?

      She freezes: Danny knows.       He smiles:   it's okay.   Then,
      to a passing waiter:

                           apart)
                   -- whiskey.

                   You're doing a great job curating
                   the museum.

      She sighs, exasperated.

                                 DANNY
                   The Vermeer is quite good. Simple
                   but vibrant. Although his work
                   definitely fell off as he got
                   older.

                                 TESS

                   And I still get Monet and Manet
                   confused. Which one married his

                                  DANNY
                   Right.   Manet had syphilis.

                                 TESS
                   They also painted occasionally.

                                 TESS
                   Did it always go this poorly?

                   Sounds frustrating.

                                 DANNY
                   You were never easy.
                          (as she shrugs)
                   Okay. I'll make this quick. I came
                   here for you. I'm gonna get on with
                   my life, and I want you with me.

                                 TESS
                   You're a thief and a liar.

                                 DANNY
                   I only lied about being a thief.
                   But I don't do that anymore.

                                  TESS

108   INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM - SAME TIME                               108

      At the table, Saul bets heavily for the bank. Benedict
      approaches, stands off to the right, watching.

                                 HIGH ROLLER
                          (to Saul, noticing his
                           heavy bet)
                   You don't want to get in the hole
                   too heavy to this Benedict. A
                   friend of mine once borrowed a
                   hundred g's from the guy. Two
                   months went by, Benedict hadn't
                   heard from him, he calls my friend
                   up, asks 'Where's my money?' I'll
                   get to it when I get to it,' my
                   friend says. Half hour later
                   Benedict's in my friend's hotel
                   room, dangling him off his 10th
                   floor balcony by his feet. 'You
                   gonna get to it now?'

      High Roller turns over a nine.     Saul wins.

                   I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the
                   gaming board would feed me to my
                   white tigers.

                                 SAUL
                   That's a shame. You're the king
                   of Vegas and you have to play

      CORNER - MOMENT LATER

      Benedict and Saul are huddled in a corner.

                   The fight is Saturday, is it not?

                   No, no. Hand-to-hand combat
                   doesn't interest me. I have a
                   package arriving here Saturday
                   evening. A black briefcase,
                   standard size, the contents of
                   which are very valuable to me.

                                 BENEDICT
                   I'd be happy to put it in the
                   house safe for you.

                                 SAUL
                   The house safe is for brandy and
                   grandmother's pearls. I'm afraid
                   I need something more secure.

                                 BENEDICT
                   I can assure you, the house safe
                   is utterly...

                   I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
                   your generosity in this matter
                   will not go overlooked. Now:
                   what can you offer me besides the
                   safe?

      Saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar
      with being denied. And Benedict recognizes that fact.

                                 TESS
                   See, the kind of people you steal
                   things from, they have insurance
                   to compensate them. They get made
                   whole again. I had to leave New
                   York to get away from what
                   happened. How do I get my five
                   years back, Danny?

                                 DANNY
                   You can't. But what you can do is
                   not throw away another five years.

                   Listen, you don't love me anymore,
                   you want to make a life with
                   someone else? Fine, I'll have to
                   live with that. But not him.

                                 TESS
                   Spoken like a true ex-husband.

                                 DANNY
                   I'm not joking, Tess.

                   I'm not laughing.

      Danny exhales and leans back.

                   Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm
                   wrong.

      She looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he
      isn't. She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful.
      He sees her looking at it.

                   you should walk out the door if

      Nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg.
      Basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles,
      whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an
      emerald shape. There's a KNOCK at the door...

112   EXT. PARADISO HOTEL (ON STRIP) - DAY                        112

      Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity
      stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the
      Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino.

      A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry
      Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face
      in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her
      man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on
      his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.

                              REPORTER
                ... and here's Reuben Tishkoff,
                former owner of the Paradiso, come
                to bid farewell to his fabled
                resort and wish Terry Benedict all
                the best with his future plans for
                the property...

      Terry greets Reuben before the TV cameras and newspaper
      reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but
      behind those smiles and under their breaths...

                              BENEDICT
                Good to see you.

                              REUBEN
                Go shit in your mouth.

      Tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring
      back at her: Danny's. She holds his glance a moment --
      long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice --
      before turning away, to...

      ... Benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps
      up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and
      together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and
      Benedict leans into a microphone...

                              BENEDICT
                I hope there's as much dynamite in
                the Paradiso as there will be in
                this Saturday's fight.

      ... and -- WHOOMPH -- the PLUNGER comes down and -- write
      your own onomatopoeia here -- the PARADISO IMPLODES.
      Reuben wipes a tear from his eye.

                              REUBEN

                   Call is at five-thirty. Makeup

                   arrives at seven-fifteen, and
                   Linus grabs our codes. All goes
                   well there and we're a go. Seven-
                   thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen
                   and we're committed. From that
                   point, we have thirty minutes to
                   blow the power or he suffocates.

      We DESCEND ONTO the miniature of the vault, then --

      The Bellagio vault. A clock reads: 8:03.

                   Once the electricity goes, all
                   entry points to the vault and its
                   elevator will automatically lock
                   down for two minutes. That's when
                   we make our move...

      Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the
      vault's center and march out again, closing the thick
      metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK...

      ... We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart. There
      is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then...

      ... the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen
      within, folded neatly.

      He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the
      cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. He takes
      in the room: vacant and silent.

                   Okay: they've put you in the

      A WIDER ANGLE reveals we're...


116   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         116

      The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and
      what we've been watching has been a trial run. Ten of
      the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is
      still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew
      watching a dress rehearsal.

                                 FRANK
                   Fin says he shorts it.

                                 LIVINGSTON
                   Make it a sawbuck.

      From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash
      cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with
      both hands without touching the floor. From this
      position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the
      door...

      Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to
      see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes
      -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.

                                 BASHER
                          (and he's not happy)
                   We're in deep shit.


117   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         117

      Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he
      spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if
      nobody understands a word he's saying, that's okay...

                   Basher. What happened?


118   FLASHBACK - INT. VEGAS SEWERS - THAT AFTERNOON                  118

      A cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse
      boxes, and Basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of
      effluent.

                                 BASHER (V.O.)
                   They did exactly what I planned to
                   do. Only they did it by accident.
                   Now they know their weakness. And
                   they're fixing it.

      An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city
      engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.


119   INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)                   119

      Basher towels off his hair...

                   So...

                                 BASHER
                   So unless we decide to do this job
                   in Reno, we're screwed.

      Danny rises and paces, frustrated.      He's come too far for
      things to go awry now.

       Basher dries his hair.

                    We could use a pinch.

120    INT. LAB - DAY                                                  120

       Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a
       glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.

                                  BASHER (V.O.)
                    A pinch is the equivalent of a
                    cardiac arrest for any broad-band
                    electrical circuitry. Or better
                    yet: A pinch is a bomb... but
                    without the bomb. Every time a
                    nuclear weapon detonates, it
                    unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
                    which shuts down any power source
                    within its vicinity. That tends
                    not to matter in most cases
                    because the nuclear weapon
                    destroys everything you might need
                    power for anyway. Now a pinch
                    creates a similar electromagnetic
                    pulse, but without the headache of
                    mass destruction and death. So
                    instead of Hiroshima, you get the
                    Seventeenth Century.

       Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen
       and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both
       prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for
       Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.

                                   DANNY

       They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door.
       Linus starts to follow but...

      They can be heard WRESTLING. Linus has had enough.     He

      A moment passes.

      A moment passes.

      And the next door opens, and Danny, Basher, and Yen
      appear, pinch in hand -- they've succeeded. They weave a

      Everyone realizes:    he's not here.   Just then:

      SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life.      Uh-oh.

      Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by
      his side. His eyes scan the compound, then:

      of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell. Linus
      scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasing
      guards. As he ascends out of sight...

      Danny shifts his focus to -


      DANNY'S POV

      The other side of the building, and two more guards
      arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase:
      Linus will be trapped.


      BACK TO SCENE

      Danny, Basher, and Yen squat side-by-side-by-side,
      watching all this. Yen makes a colorful observation about
      Linus's predicament; of course, no one understands it.

                                     TURK (O.S.)
                    Where'd he go?


       BACK TO SCENE

       Danny and Basher slowly turn: Turk and Virgil crouch
       inches behind them, wanting to spectate as well.

                                   TURK
                            (off Danny's look)
                    What?
                           (then, realizing their
                            goof, to his brother,
                            remonstratively)
                    Would you -- shouldn't someone be
                    behind the wheel?

       CRASH!

       A second-story WINDOW EXPLODES as a desk chair flies
       through it, followed shortly by Linus who leaps onto a
       steel-mesh overhang running alongside the building.

       Virgil leaps into the driver's seat, shifts into reverse.

       Linus runs along the overhang, then leaps down, onto the
       reversing van, and rolls along its roof and down its
       windshield.

       shoulder: get in the back.

       Linus scrambles back over the van, and Danny and Yen pull
       him in. Virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway, but he
       does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them
       slams shut right on Yen's hand -- CRUNCH!

       hand, and Danny stares down Linus, breathless.

                                  DANNY
                    I say stay in the van, you stay in

      Livingston has moved A/V operations into Lyman Zerga's
      suite. As he scours the same images the watchers
      downstairs do, he eavesdrops on their communications
      through his headset.

      He glances at his watch, then outside again as the white
      van arrives, dropping off only Linus and Danny, who slaps
      the van's roof before it pulls away.

      As Danny and Linus enter the lobby, Rusty falls into step
      with them, exchanging a smile with Danny but not Linus,
      he still looks chastised from the car-trailer.

      Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny.
      Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador
      Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently.

                   This is a problem.

      A pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem,
      this is disastrous. Only SAUL dares make a noise,
      HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room.

                   Not anymore.

      Danny stares daggers at Rusty. But he can see: everyone
      in the room is on Rusty's side. Defeated, he stalks out
      of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down
      Linus.

                                 TISHKOFF
                   But, but... he can't just be out.
                   Who's gonna take his place?

      Rusty turns to Linus.

                                 RUSTY
                   Kid, you up for it?

      Linus's eyes drift to Danny outside -- whatever acrimony
      he felt before, he never meant to kick Danny off the job.
      He nods, half-cocksure/half-scared-pissless: he's up for
      it.

                                 RUSTY
                          (to Livingston)
                   Find everyone else. Let 'em know
                   the change in plan. Curtain goes
                   up at seven.

      Livingston exits. Everyone else in the room staggers
      about, like witnesses after an execution. Rusty steps
      out onto the balcony, perhaps to console Danny, but (as
      Linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be
      heard.

144   INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                  144

      Tess, readying herself for the big evening, meets her own
      glance in a dressing mirror, then spots Benedict in its
      reflection, pacing the bedroom behind her.

                                 BENEDICT
                          (on phone)
                   Yes. Yes. No. Very much no.
                          (beat)
                   Then inform Mr. Levin he'll find a
                   better view of the fight in front
                   of his television. Surely he must
                   have H.B.O.

      Hanging up, Benedict approaches her, puts his hands on
      her shoulders...

                                 BENEDICT
                   What are you thinking about?

                                 TESS
                   You.

      She smiles at him in the mirror.    His glance in it,
      turns from her to himself.

                Any sign of Ocean?

                                MANAGER (WALSH)
                Not   in a couple hours. You want
                him   out? I can bounce him from
                the   state for parole violation if
                you   like.

                              BENEDICT
                       (shakes his head)
                Put a guy on him. He's here for a
                reason. I'd like to know what it
                is. But if he comes anywhere near
                Tess, take it to the next level.

                                MANAGER

      Benedict nods, goes on his way.

      Saul, as Lyman Zerga, stands ramrod straight, looking
      through sliding glass doors out at the valet station.

      From behind, Terry Benedict approaches, two security
      guards walking half a pace behind him. Saul spots him in
      the glass's reflection; he does not turn.

                                SAUL
                Mr. Benedict.

                             BENEDICT
                Mr. Zerga. It's a very busy night
                for me. Are we on schedule?

                              SAUL
                I have no reason to suspect
                otherwise. My couriers should be
                here momentarily.

      A beat as Benedict studies Saul.

                              BENEDICT
                It's a nice evening. Shall we
                wait outside?

      Benedict and Saul emerge, guards positioned around them.

                They're in position.

                        (over STATIC)
                Okay.   We're a go.


150   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - VALET AREA - SUNSET                    150

      A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races
      up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait.

      Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase
      handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the
      driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard
      suits.

                               TURK
                Mr. Zerga.   A gift from Mr. Hesse.

      Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both
      clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the
      cuff on Turk's wrist, transfers it to Saul's, clamps it
      shut, and hands Saul the key.

                              SAUL
                Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther.

      He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the
      hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.

      Frank deals blackjack to a full table. His eyes gaze

      The guard goes, and Benedict continues with Saul...

                                 BENEDICT
                   I'm afraid I can't allow my
                   private security personnel
                   inside the casino cages. I hope

                   Of course not.

      Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when...

      ... passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an
      old RACETRACK DENIZEN happens past this cabal and, worse
      yet, happens to recognize Saul.

                                  RACETRACK DENIZEN
                   Saul?   Saul Bloom, is that you?

      Saul does his best to ignore the man. But even Benedict
      notices: this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga.

                                 RACETRACK DENIZEN
                   Saul, it's me. Bucky Buchanan,
                   remember? From Saratoga.

      At last Saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes.

                                 SAUL
                   Friedrich, Gunther.

      An order: dispose of this man. Virgil and Turk pick up
      the Denizen by his elbows and haul him away.

                No sweat, kid. You're a rock.
                       (as Linus smiles,
                        feeling good about
                        himself)
                Now don't fuck up.


158   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - ON LIVINGSTON'S MONITOR - NIGHT            158

      Linus's smile disappears as he continues to bounce.
      There's a KNOCK at the door.

                   Room service.

      Rusty checks through the peephole, then ushers in Turk
      and Virgil in costume with their room service cart.

                                 TURK
                   Who ordered the penne?

      Livingston raises a hand, and as Turk serves him his
      plate, Virgil whips off the cart's tablecloth:
      underneath it's the false-lid cash cart. Rusty turns to
      a corner.

                                   RUSTY
                   You ready?

      In it, Yen finishes bandaging his busted hand and nods.


159   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - THE EYE IN THE SKY              159

      Fat and Slim sit before their monitors, feet kicked up,
      as behind them Walsh, Benedict, and Saul enter.

                                 WALSH
                   This is our security center, where
                   we oversee all gaming in the
                   casino as well as our vault.
                   You'll be able to monitor your
                   briefcase from here.

      Walsh, finding Fat and Slim as they are, coughs; the two
      watchers leap immediately to their feet. Benedict checks
      his watch.

                                 SAUL
                   Don't let me keep you.

                   Deep breaths, deep breaths.

      ... and here comes Benedict, exiting the cage just as his
      assistant arrives with his portfolio. As he turns toward
      the restaurant...

      Benedict sighs -- his evening's been sidetracked enough
      already -- but...

      Danny watches Benedict escort Linus toward the blackjack
      tables, unaware that TWO PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GOONS
      watch him from across the bar, and when he turns in their
      direction, they look away, acting incognito, but it's not
      them he's turning toward...

      ... it's Tess, rounding a corner toward the restaurant.
      Danny jumps to his feet, throws a tip on the bar, and
      goes.

      The time is 7:27.

      Yen tucks himself into the cash cart's hidden compartment
      with a slim oxygen tank for company. Meanwhile, Rusty
      drills Virgil and Turk...

                   Hey. What do we look like: a
                   couple of peckerwood jackasses or
                   something?

      No one responds.

                            to Yen, squeezed into
                            the cart)
                   Amazing: how's it feel? You
                   alright?
                          (as Yen nods)
                   Want something to read? Magazine?

      From the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to
      show Rusty what he can do with a magazine.

                                  RUSTY
                   Okay. I'm counting down.    Thirty
                   minutes of breathing time
                   starts... now.

      On "now" a RUNNING CLOCK APPEARS ON-SCREEN, descending
      from 29:59. It will REMAIN there for the duration of the
      pre-pinch heist, jumping at times BETWEEN SCENES.

      Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top
      a tug: it's shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the
      tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the
      way to the door.

      Pit Boss's station.
                              LINUS
                It only came to our attention this
                morning, Mr. Benedict. Apparently
                he has a record longer than my
                arm.

                                 BENEDICT

      Benedict and Linus wait, side-by-side. While Linus does
      his best to play it cool, Benedict dips into his
      portfolio.

      Suspicious of the young man, he decides to test him.

      Linus and Benedict lead Frank away.       As they pass an
      elevator...

      ... its doors open, revealing Turk and Virgil, dressed

      then peers up to find Reuben Tishkoff approaching, on
      either side of him two gorgeous young women, all blonde
      hair and breasts and legs, women who wouldn't give Hefner
      the time of day.

                                 MAITRE D'

                   Something quiet before the fight.

                                 MAITRE D'
                   I can put you at 19 in just a
                   couple minutes.

      The Maitre d' turns to his next customer:         Tess.   She, of
      course, merits a table instantly.

                                 MAITRE D'
                   Good evening, Miss Ocean.    Right
                   this way...

      Reuben can't help but stare as Tess passes by. His eyes

      Just as she's sitting, Danny approaches.       She goes
      straight at him, apoplectic.

                                   TESS
                   Danny:    No.

                   I'll just be a moment.

                   I'm having you thrown out of
                   here.

      She starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and
      she wheels on him.

                                 TESS
                   You're up to something, Danny.
                   What? And don't say you came here
                   for me. You're pulling a job,
                   aren't you?

                   Well, know this: no matter what

                   can't afford it.

                                 DANNY

      This surprises Tess, and, truth be told, saddens her; she
      studies him a moment, unsure of what to say.

                                 TESS

      Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright
      with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then

      Danny runs smack into the Plainclothes Goons.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1
                   Mr. Ocean. Mr. Benedict would
                   like to see you.

                                 DANNY
                          (resignedly, these men
                           are much too big to
                           tangle with)
                   I thought he might.

      The Plainclothes Goons escort Danny away, right past
      Reuben who frowns, concerned.


170   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO MANAGER'S OFFICE - 18:25                    170

      Frank stands at attention before Linus and Benedict.
      Linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt
      when it pinches him. Benedict checks his watch: the
      fight's opening bell is growing closer and closer.

                                  LINUS
                   Thank you for your cooperation,
                   Mr. Escalante.

                   Mr. Benedict, I'm afraid you've
                   been employing an ex-convict. As
                   you know, the N.G.C. strictly
                   forbids...

                          (leering at Linus,
                           simmering)
                   You heard me. Just 'cause a black
                   man tries to earn a decent wage in
                   this state...

                                 LINUS

                   I resent your implication that
                   race has anything to do with this.
                          (to Benedict)
                   Now, as I was saying, the Nevada

      Two guards stand sentry outside the cage door. Virgil
      and Turk move up with their cash cart, and when Virgil
      reaches for his keycard... it's gone.

                                 VIRGIL
                   Aw, I think... Jesus.    I lost my
                   card.

      The guards frown at him.     A SECURITY OFFICER approaches.

                   What's going on here?

                           sentries)
                   Take this cart inside.

      The sentry nods, swipes his keycard, and enters with the
      cash cart. Turk and Virgil hesitate a moment to watch it
      enter, then hurry off.

      and counting. Benedict exits the casino Manager's office
      with Linus and Frank. Benedict hails two GUARDS...

                              BENEDICT
                Please show this man off the
                premises.
                       (to Frank)
                Don't step foot in my casino
                again.

                               FRANK

                         to Linus)
                Cracker.

      Benedict checks his watch again:    he's really running
      late.

                              BENEDICT
                Mr. Wills, if you don't mind...
                       (as Linus forgets
                        to respond)
                Mr. Wills?

                               LINUS
                Of course.

      They start toward the exit.   But halfway there...

                               LINUS
                My beeper.   I'm sorry.   I forgot
                it.

      Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's
      behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but
      leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in
      his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras
      all about and he decides to risk it.

                              BENEDICT
                You know how to get back out?

                               LINUS
                Of course.   Enjoy the fight.

                        then hurrying away)
                Thank you.

      Linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of
      combinations he lifted off the man.

                Benedict will be?

                              GOON #1
                Just a few minutes more.

      He scans the room.

                              DANNY
                No cameras in this room, huh?
                Don't want anyone seeing what
                happens here?

      The Goons say nothing.   Danny checks his watch.

                              DANNY
                He's not coming, is he?

      The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their
      bluff.

                               DANNY
                Who is?

      There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile:
      Danny's about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher
      in...

      ... the BRUISER, come to beat the shit out of Danny
      Ocean. The guy's at least six-six, three hundred pounds,
      but it's not his size that draws attention, it's his
      teeth...

      ... or the lack thereof; the Bruiser doesn't hold a
      single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth. Gum
      city. And there's something really terrifying about the
      sight.

                                 DANNY
                   I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like
                   me talking to his girl.

      The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the
      Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those
      gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a
      hole in this man. The Goons head for the door.

                                 GOON #1
                   We're gonna step outside now.
                   Leave you two alone to talk things
                   over.

      The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as
      Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes
      out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little
      blood from his lip.

                                 DANNY
                   Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.

                                   BRUISER
                   Sorry, Danny.    I -- I forgot.

                                   DANNY
                   S'okay.
                          (shaking it off)
                   How's the wife?

                                 BRUISER
                   Pregnant again.

                   Then we better get to work.


179   OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM                                   179

      Standing guard outside, the Goons hear PUNCHES and GROANS
      from inside as...


180   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM                                      180

      ... Danny climbs onto Bruiser's shoulders and pushes
      through the ceiling rafters, groaning every time Bruiser
      slaps his fist into his hand.

       A guard wheels in the Yen-filled cash cart, parks it in
       a station next to its twin, then -- as an afterthought --
       plants Saul's briefcase right on top if it -- clunk -- an
       unforeseen obstacle to Yen's escape.

       Saul witnesses this, too, and stifles a reaction.

                                  WALSH
                    Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

                                  SAUL
                    Yes, I'm very satisfied.

                           (to Slim)
                    Close it up.

       On the monitor, the vault door closes, but Saul looks
       anything but satisfied. He's sweaty, his mouth's so dry
       he can't swallow, and he keeps patting down his pockets
       for his Rolaids, without finding them.

                                  FAT
                    You alright, sir?

      him.

                Going to video now.


187   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                 187

      As Saul and his heart attack hold the spotlight, a
      security monitor flips from a shot of Linus entering the
      elevator to a Livingston-fed videotape of an empty lift.

                              WALSH
                       (as Saul passes out)
                Call for a doctor.

      Linus immediately reaches up to the elevator's ceiling,
      rips down its panel to reveal a trap door. As he starts
      to push it open...

      ... a hand yanks it free from above.    It's Danny.

                              DANNY
                You didn't really think I was
                gonna sit this one out, did you?

                              LINUS
                What, didn't you trust me?

                              DANNY
                I do now.

      He reaches down and pulls Linus, wide-eyed, up to the
      roof of the elevator.

      The boxers enter the ring before a full, cheering house.

      Benedict and Tess find their ringside seats, a row in
      front of Reuben and his "nieces."

       Danny rips off his jacket and shirt to expose a rappelling
       line wrapped around his torso. Linus does the same.

                               LINUS
                 How'd you get here?

                               DANNY
                 Crawlspace. And I had to give
                 away a couple mil.

                               LINUS
                 But what about -- I mean, that
                 whole thing with Rusty...

       Danny just smiles at him.


A192   FLASHBACK - EXT. MIRADOR SUITE - BALCONY                        A192

       Earlier that night, just after Rusty kicked Danny off
       the job. As Linus watches from inside, deaf to their
       conversation, blind to their expressions, Danny and
       Rusty confer.

                               DANNY
                 You think the kid bought it?

                                RUSTY
                 Hell, I think Reuben bought it,
                 and he knew we were screwing
                 around.
                         (beat)
                 You sure about this?

                               DANNY
                        (nods)
                 Bobby Caldwell threw me into the
                 pool first time. Least I could do
                 is give his kid a push.

                 Why'd you make me go through all

       Danny leads Linus down and around the elevator and side-
       by-side they crawl onto the bottom of the elevator,
       gripping the undercarriage of the lift to keep from
       falling. Meanwhile, we DESCEND QUICKLY DOWN the shaft,
       just to illustrate how very high up they are.


192    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - 00:53                              192

       Rusty, playing doctor, inspects Saul. At the same time,
       he inspects a monitor: the vault door closing with the
       Yen-filled cash cart and Saul's briefcase inside.

       Rusty stops, listens to Saul's chest, then drops his
       head...

                                  RUSTY
                    He's gone.

       Walsh, Fat and Slim all bow their heads.     At the door,
       two paramedics arrive with a stretcher.

                                  WALSH
                    You're too late, guys.   He's dead.

       The first paramedic turns to his partner and admonishes
       him:

                    A buck it is.

       And they're ready, poised at the top, looking into the
       abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared
       sensors.

203   HURTLING WITH DANNY AND LINUS                                 203

      DOWN the elevator shaft.

      Upside down, heads curled, and all we hear is the WHOOSH
      of their bodies in motion and the WHIRL of their CORDS
      UNCOILING.

                   ... six, seven.....

      And now, looking STRAIGHT DOWN, the ground is rising up
      fast to meet them, a flat slab of gray concrete -- fifty
      feet, forty feet, thirty feet, twenty...

                                 BASHER

      And SNAP -- the CORDS reach their full extension, and
      Danny and Linus bounce up, watching the floor recede.

                                 LINUS
                   Aaaaahhhhh!

      In the distance, lights come up again, first at the
      Mirage, then the MGM, gradually approaching...


205   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BOTTOM                                    205

      Coming to a rest about ten feet from the floor, Danny
      quickly pulls a slim blade and slashes the two coils
      straight across. He and Linus go tumbling to the floor
      as their drop lines recoil lightning fast to their
      elevator anchors, just before...

      ... the infrared lights go back on-line.


206   INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA                                     206

      The lights suddenly flash back on, revealing...

      ... both fighters standing, and Tyson takes advantage of
      Lewis's disorientation and throws a sucker punch to his
      jaw. Down goes Lewis, and up goes the crowd, roaring.

                                 REF

      Benedict makes a quick survey; the arena is apoplectic
      from the blackout-knockout.

      He cranes his neck, looking around the room, surveying
      his empire: he smells a rat. His eyes fall on Reuben
      behind him, but Reuben just shrugs: "I didn't pull the
      plug."

      All the lights are back on, and Basher observes his

208   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BOTTOM                                   208

      Linus and Danny arise from where they've fallen,
      clutching their heads and rubbing bruises. Danny doesn't
      recover as quickly.

                                  LINUS
                   You alright?

                                 DANNY
                   No, but you're sweet to ask.


209   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT                                            209

      Lights are just flickering on here when...

      ... the false lid of the cash cart thrust upward
      slightly. It's Yen trying to get out, out of air and
      only now alert to Saul's heavy case resting atop him.


210   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                     210

      Livingston watches this on his monitors, just coming
      back on, his finger poised on a play button, as Frank
      comes in the door.

                                  FRANK
                   Are they in?

      Frank shrugs. Suddenly one of the monitors aligns itself,
      and Livingston presses play.


      ON MONITOR A

      Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the
      three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty. And of the vault
      itself: Yen trying to get out of the cash cart.


      ON MONITOR B

      Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the
      three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty... and in totally
      different positions. Of the vault: no cash cart, but no
      Zerga briefcase, no Yen.


      LIVINGSTON

                                 LIVINGSTON

      His eyes fixing on Saul's briefcase pushing closer to the
      edge of the cash cart as Yen tries to free himself.

                                 LIVINGSTON
                   ... shift.


211   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               211

      The room is abuzz with activity. The monitors here
      flicker back on, too, displaying the images from monitor
      B, but every watcher in the place is watching a table
      because...


212   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                 212

      ... the floor is going nuts. After the ten seconds of
      darkness, all bets are off. Some players doubled-down
      during the blackout, others miraculously halved their
      bets. Consequently, Livingston's video feed switch goes
      unnoticed.

       Danny and Linus pry open the elevator doors and squeeze
       out. Just beyond the next doorway stand...

       ... three UZI-CARRYING GUARDS, hovering outside the vault
       door and wondering what the hell just happened to the
       lights.


A215   INT. VAULT                                                      A215

       Yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the
       more he pushes, the more Saul's briefcase slides off.
       Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid
       beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.


B215   INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE VAULT                                     B215

       The Uzi-Carrying Guards turn their backs to the elevator
       shaft...

       ... and Linus and Danny appear in the doorway; they both
       snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor.

                                  UZI-CARRYING GUARD #1
                           (sniffing something)
                    Jesus, Ron, was that you?

       Linus and Danny wait, Danny silently mouthing a three-
       count before... THUD, THUD, THUD. They peer around the
       corridor to find...

       All three Uzi-carrying guards lie unconscious on the
       ground. Linus starts in, Danny holds him back...

                                   DANNY
                    Not yet.

       Danny and Linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the
       gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards' bodies.

                                  LINUS
                    You think Yen made it out okay?

                                  DANNY
                    I'm sure he's fine.

       Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart,
       which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate
       this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out to
       grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid
       until...

       ... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor...

       ... but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached to
       it and swings it round. He's got it. That threat over, he
       throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath
       of his life.


B217   INT. VAULT CORRIDOR                                         B217

       Linus punches in the code for the door to the vault
       anteroom (the one he stole from Benedict). He steps back
       as it slides open, revealing --

       -- the vault door:     it is sleek and immense and
       impregnable.

                                  LINUS
                           (jaw dropping)
                    Jesus...

                                  DANNY
                    There's a Chinese man with a
                    hundred sixty million dollars
                    behind that door. Let's get him
                    out.

       Danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard.


217    INT. VAULT                                                  217

       Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase
       opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's
       "emeralds"). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he
       knows: it's time for his leap. It's the same distance
       as the leap he made in the practice session, but this
       time he's only got one good hand.


218    INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                          218

      Yen prepares for his leap, then springs...

      ... across the room, to the ledge he must grab...

      ... and he grabs it, but with only one hand he's slipping
      right away, and in a second he'll hit the sensored
      floor...

      ... but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs,
      propping himself up between two walls, inches above the
      floor. An acrobatic wonder.


220   INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                           220

      Danny, oblivious to this close call, slaps the door
      again. A moment passes, then: Yen responds with a slap,
      too.

                                  DANNY
                   Okay.


222   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   222

      As Basher enters, Livingston and Frank watch on a monitor
      Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict
      as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a
      detonator.

                                  FRANK
                   That's it?

                   There's still the five pins and
                   the floor sensor. Not much we can
                   do about that from this side of
                   the door. But from this side...

      He punches up the image of Yen in the vault.

                                 BASHER

       Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault
       door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is.
       He affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball
       pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set.


A224   OUTSIDE VAULT                                                  A224

       Danny responds with two slaps of his own. He steps
       back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault
       door.

                                   DANNY

       Yen starts his retreat from the door, but gets yanked
       back.

       His hand's bandage is caught on the door.

       Yen tries to free himself, but he can't use his other
       hand lest he drop to the floor. He tries gnawing at
       his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a
       plastic explosive.

        Yen, still on the door, remains frozen.       Trembling.

        A beat.

        Then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money
        shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he
        can get.

        Danny presses it again.      Still nothing.

                                     LINUS
                     What's wrong?

                                     DANNY
                     I don't know.

        Linus comes over to look.

                                   LINUS
                     You check the batteries?

        Danny blanches.    Linus shoots him a look.

224    INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                       224

       Livingston, Frank, and Basher watch the monitors in
       disbelief...

       Saul enters, alive and dressed as himself again.      His
       job is complete.

                                  SAUL
                    Everything going okay?


225    INT. VAULT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE VAULT                              225

       As Danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in
       power meters: both at zero percent), Linus ransacks the
       Uzi-carrying Guards' gear for replacements. He finds
       AA's in their flashlights.

                                  LINUS
                    You know, you lose focus for one
                    second in this game --

                                  DANNY
                    -- and someone gets hurt, yeah
                    yeah. I don't hear Yen complaining.

       He takes the batteries, inserts them in his detonator,
       then slaps the door twice more.

       Yen catches his breath on the far end of the room. He
       hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the
       line of fire.

       Linus inches forward, almost dreading this moment,
       pauses...

       Linus pulls... and the door opens.

       Danny and Linus enter. Silence. The cash carts have
       crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held.

                                  DANNY
                    Amazing?

       Linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens
       it...

       Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he
       just dropped out of a cyclone.

                                  YEN
                           (his only English)
                    Where the fuck you been?

       Livingston, Frank, Saul, and Basher watch as the first
       wave of bills gets tossed onto the vault floor. Smiles
       all around.

                    No, I guess not. Not really.

                                  SAUL
                    This is better.

228   INT. CASINO - OUTSIDE FIGHT ARENA                              228

      Rusty steps forward as people stream past him out of the
      fight arena. He dials his cell phone, listens...


229   INT. MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA                                    229

      MOVING WITH Benedict and Tess, pushing their way out
      through the crowd. A PHONE is RINGING nearby... again
      and again...

                               BENEDICT
                 You gonna answer it?

                               TESS
                 I don't have a cell phone.

      They keep moving, but the RING pursues them. Finally,
      Benedict stops, pulls Tess's purse from her shoulder and
      opens it: inside, he finds a CELL PHONE, RINGING.

                                  TESS
                 It isn't mine.

                               BENEDICT
                 See who's on the other end.

      She takes the phone, activates it.

                                  TESS
                 Hello?

                               RUSTY (V.O.)
                 May I have a word with Mr.
                 Benedict, please?

      Tess looks up, confused.

                                  TESS
                 It's for you.

      Benedict takes the phone.

                               BENEDICT
                 Who the hell is this?


      ON RUSTY

      in the distance, at the arena's exit, unseen by Benedict
      or Tess, on the phone...

230   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               230

      Benedict enters, and fear enters with him. And, of
      course, Tess. As the room buzzes with activity, he keeps
      the cell phone pressed to his ear.

                              BENEDICT
                What the hell is going on down
                there in the vault?

                                FAT
                Nothing, sir.    All normal.

                                BENEDICT
                Show me.

      Fat points to the security-cam view of the vault corridor
      and vault -- Livingston's tape.

                                FAT
                All quiet.

                              BENEDICT
                       (on phone,
                        venomously)
                I'm afraid you're mistaken.


231   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   231

      Frank, Basher and Saul watch over Livingston's shoulder
      as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small
      speaker.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                You're watching your monitor?
                Okay, keep watching.

      Livingston punches in numbers...


232   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY -             232
      ON FAT'S MONITOR

      New images suddenly appear. Three masked men in the
      vault throw stacks of money onto the floor; the three Uzi
      Guards lie bound and unconscious in the corridor.

      The security center, understandably, erupts in activity.

       Rusty strolls so casually there's no reason anyone
       passing would suspect he was doing more than ordering a
       pizza.

                               RUSTY (V.O.)
                 In this town, your luck can change
                 just that quickly.

                        (close to apoplectic,
                         takes a breath and
                         cups the phone, then
                         barks at Walsh)
                 Find out how much money we have
                 down there.

       Tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious: how did
       that cell phone get into her handbag? And suddenly it
       hits her...


A235   FLASHBACK - INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER THAT EVENING             A235

                               DANNY
                 Good-bye.

       Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright
       with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then
       gently kisses it...

       ... as he slips the cell phone into her handbag,
       unnoticed.

                               BENEDICT
                        (on phone)
                 Alright. You've proved your
                 point. You've broken into my
                 vault. Congratulations: you're a
                 dead man.

       Tess leaves.

                               RUSTY (V.O.)
                 Maybe.

                               BENEDICT
                 May I ask: how do you expect to
                 leave here, hmm?

       INTERCUT WITH:


235    INT. CASINO FLOOR                                              235

                        BENEDICT
          Do you believe I'll simply allow
          you to parade bags full of my
          money out my casino doors?

A distance beyond Rusty, Tess exits the cages. She
stops, puzzling over what to do, happens to spot him.

                         RUSTY
          No.   You're gonna carry it out for
          us.

                        BENEDICT
                 (has to laugh)
          And why would I do that?

                        RUSTY
          Take a closer look at your
          monitor...

236   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                         236

      Benedict does. As the three masked men stuff money into
      large canvas bags and mark the bags with X's, another
      portion of cash remains untouched, booby-trapped.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                As your manager's probably
                reporting to you by now, you have
                a little over a hundred sixty
                million in your vault tonight.

      And, as if Rusty was in the room watching, Walsh
      approaches with the night's cash count: $163,156,759.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                You may notice: we're only
                packing up about half that. The
                other half we're leaving in your
                vault, booby-trapped, as a
                hostage.


237   INT. CASINO FLOOR                                            237

                              RUSTY
                You let our eighty million go, and
                you get to keep your eighty.
                That's the deal. You try and stop
                us, we'll blow both cash loads.

      He spins and -- gasp -- comes face-to-face with Tess.
      She stares at him directly: she knows.

                                  RUSTY
                          (holding her glance)
                   Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty
                   million dollars secretly tonight
                   or you can lose a hundred sixty
                   million dollars publicly. It's
                   your decision.

      He cups the phone.

                                   RUSTY
                   Hi.

      Benedict cups his phone, too, and vents his rage. He
      knows what he should do -- let the money go -- and he
      knows what he wants to do -- stop these sonsabitches.   He
      makes his choice...

                                  BENEDICT
                          (to Walsh)
                   Make the call.

                Where's Danny?

                He's fine. He wants you to go

                It's alright, Tess. I promise.
                       (back on phone)
                Good. Here's what you do. Five
                minutes from now, the men in the
                vault are going to deposit six
                bags in the vault elevator.

      Tess isn't sure what to do. As Rusty continues on the
      phone, she backs off, debating: can she blow the whistle
      on her ex?


242   INT. VAULT ELEVATOR - CLOSE ON SIX CANVAS BAGS                 242

      each sealed tight, each marked with an X, loaded onto
      the vault elevator.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                If they meet anyone, we'll blow
                the money in the bags and the
                money in the vault.


243   INT. CAGE - OUTSIDE VAULT ELEVATOR                             243

      A small cadre of guards await the arrival of the vault
      elevator. Its doors open to reveal the six large canvas
      bags, each sealed tight, marked with an X.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                One minute after that, the
                elevator will rise to your cages.
                Six of your guards will pick up
                the bags and carry them out into
                the casino.

      Six guards do precisely that.

                                                               131.

244   INT. CASINO - NIGHT                                             244

      MOVING WITH Rusty PAST slot machines...

                              RUSTY
                If they take more than twenty
                seconds to reach the casino floor
                or if there's any indication a
                switch has been made, we'll blow
                the money in the vault and the
                money in the bags.

      A SLOT MACHINE RINGS behind him...


245   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  245

      ... and Benedict hears it.

                              BENEDICT
                       (to Walsh)
                He's in the casino right now.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                Of course, I'm in the casino. In
                fact, I'm staying in your hotel.
                And I have two words for you:
                mini-bar.
                       (back to business)
                Now as soon as your guards hit the
                casino floor...


246   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                    246

      The six guards appear from the cage door, carrying six
      canvas bags marked with X's; Bellagio security escorts
      them from the building.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                ... a white unmarked van is going
                to pull up in your valet station.


247   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                    247

      The white VAN (now clean of the "Nevada Telecom" sign)
      IDLES before the Bellagio, its windows tinted, the
      driver's identity inscrutable. It is swarmed by
      security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                Your guards will load the bags
                into the van's rear. If anyone so
                much as approaches the driver's
                door, we blow everything.

      The guards carry out the money and load it into the van's
      rear. There, they find a video camera mounted within the
      back seat of the van monitoring them. Still they cannot
      catch a glimpse of the driver. They close the van doors.


248   BELLAGIO - FROM HIGH ABOVE                                   248

      The white van departs the valet station in front,
      clandestinely shadowed by five sedans. Meanwhile, behind
      the casino, a SWAT van arrives and unloads its squad.

                                  BENEDICT (V.O.)
                   Now what?

                                 RUSTY (V.O.)
                   Now, when I get word that the van
                   hasn't been followed, that the
                   money is secure, my men will exit
                   the building, and once their
                   safety is confirmed, you'll get
                   your vault back.

249   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               249

      Walsh mouths to Benedict: "SWAT team is here."   Benedict
      nods and throws him a thumbs-up.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Sir, I have complied with your
                   every request, would you agree?

                                  RUSTY (V.O.)
                   I would.

                                  BENEDICT
                   Good.   Now I have one of my own.

                                  RUSTY (V.O.)
                   Yes?

                                 BENEDICT
                          (at last, his venom
                           released)
                   Run and hide. If you get picked
                   up next week buying a $100,000
                   sports car in Newport Beach, I'll
                   be supremely disappointed.
                   Because I want my people to find
                   you. And rest assured: when they
                   do, they won't hand you over to
                   the police.
                          (beat)
                   Run and hide. That's all I ask.

      And during the above rant by Benedict, we view...

       now empty, Livingston's monitors still displaying the
       masked men in the vault.

       tailing the van, security goons piled into each, and
       maybe we NOTICE (or maybe not) the Rolls-Royce tailing
       them.


253    TESS                                                            253

       pacing in Benedict's suite, biting her nails, debating
       whether to blow the whistle on Danny. ON TV: a newscast
       of the contentious aftermath of the prize fight.

       vault.

       listens -- the line has gone dead.   He hangs up.

                                 WALSH
                   Our guys say the van is headed
                   toward McCarren Airport.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Get everyone in position. I want
                   my vault back before that van hits
                   the tarmac.


       LONGER MONTAGE now, CUTTING BETWEEN:

       (six in all) hustling through the cage corridors, armed
       to the teeth, with body armor and helmets and vision
       guards: they're as faceless as storm troopers.

                          (off Walsh's sheepish

                   Mr. Zerga? With the briefcase?

       pace on one screen. The SWAT team prepares to invade on
       another.

                   Do it.

      As the white van arrives at a charter airline's entrance,
      the five sedans converge upon it, TIRES SCREECHING, Goons
      emerging, weapons drawn.

                              HEAD GOON

      deep into a mesh, he finds a foreign object:

      The vault elevator doors open and Terry Benedict makes
      his way into his smoke-filled vault corridor. He passes
      the Uzi Guards, awake now and stumbling to the elevator
      with SWAT members' assistance, then arrives before his
      decimated vault: Anything within -- people, money, Lyman
      Zerga's emeralds -- could only have been destroyed.


      OVER SWAT LEADER'S SHOULDER

      as he approaches Benedict.

                Yes.

                              SWAT LEADER
                We couldn't find any survivors.
                Or, I'm afraid, any of your money.
                I'm sorry, sir.

                        anymore; the SWAT
                        team failed him)
                Take your men out now.

      HOLD ON Benedict, seething, as the SWAT Leader steps
      away...

                              SWAT LEADER
                Okay, guys, grab your gear and

                                 HEAD GOON
                   Out of the van now! Hands up!

      An EMPLOYEE from the charter airline sticks his head out
      of his office door.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                          (innocently)
                   Hey, what's going on here?

      Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction.
      The Employee disappears back inside his office.

      The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for
      the driver's door, and yanks it open...

      Inside: There is no driver. Just a video camera mounted
      at eye-level. The Head Goon cranes back his head,
      befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe
      we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's
      rear bumper.

      The van suddenly lurches.


266   SHORT DISTANCE AWAY - CLOSE ON REMOTE CONTROL                   266

      complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van
      driver's POV) and a steering mechanism -- it's a near-
      replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster
      truck drag race against his brother.

      And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben
      Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons
      scramble back from the flat-tired van.

                                 TISHKOFF
                   Enough monkey business.

      Virgil brings the van to a stop, then readies a
      distinctive red button on his remote.


267   BACK WITH VAN                                                   267

      As the Head Goon reaches for the rear door, his hand
      inches away when...

      ... BARROOOOM!    The door EXPLODES open!

      Knocked on his ass, the Head Goon watches as the canvas
      "X" bags within burn to cinders. He does, however,
      happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged
      from a bag: It's a promotional flier for a call girl
      service.

268   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT                                   268

      Benedict steps over the scattered remains of his vault.
      He picks up a fragment of a cash cart, burnt to a crisp,
      then lets it drop.

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                       (over walkie-talkie)
                Mr. Benedict...

                                BENEDICT
                Yes?

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                They took the van.

                                BENEDICT
                And?

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                       (hesitantly, this is
                        bad news)
                And they blew up the bags, sir.

                                BENEDICT
                         (dropping his walkie-
                          talkie to his side)
                Shit.

                                WALSH (V.O.)
                Sir... sir...

                                BENEDICT
                What, Walsh?

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                They say it doesn't look like
                there was any money in the bags,
                sir.

                                BENEDICT
                What?!

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                They say the bags were filled with
                fliers. For hookers.

                              BENEDICT
                What do you mean there was no
                money in the bags?

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                That's what they said, sir. I
                don't understand it: we both saw
                them putting money inside those
                bags.

      Benedict stops cold. He stares up at a wall where an
      engraved sign reading "Bellagio" has been smoke-stained.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Walsh, cue up the tape of the
                   robbery.


269   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               269

      Walsh stands before several monitors as Slim cues up the
      "masked men robbing the vault" image of a few minutes ago
      beside the present image of Benedict staring at the vault
      wall.

                                 BENEDICT (V.O.)
                   Does it say 'Bellagio' on the
                   south wall of the vault?

      In the masked-men image it does not, in fact, say
      "Bellagio" there.

                                 WALSH
                          (on walkie-talkie)
                   No, sir. It doesn't. I -- I
                   don't understand...

      Benedict exhales.

                                 BENEDICT
                   We had that installed on Tuesday.
                   The image we saw of the men
                   robbing us was a tape.

                                  WALSH (V.O.)
                   What?

                                 BENEDICT
                   Someone built a double of my
                   vault, then made a tape of them
                   robbing it. When we saw them
                   putting money in those bags, that
                   wasn't actually happening.


271   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                         271

      Walsh's jaw drops as he watches the tape again.

                                  WALSH
                   Then, sir...

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                ... what happened to all the
                money?


273   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - CLOSE ON SWAT DUFFEL BAG - NIGHT        273

      carried through the Bellagio casino, held by the SWAT
      Leader leading his men out (now eight in all), and at
      last we PULL UP to see his face for the first time...

      It's Rusty, in full regalia, leading Livingston, Turk,
      Saul, Frank, Basher, Yen and Linus out of the casino,
      each dressed as a SWAT member, each carrying a duffel bag
      with nearly $20 million dollars inside.

      As we PASS each man, under the HUM OF the CASINO, we see:

      dressed as a SWAT member, hustles down a cage corridor.


276   SAUL                                                           276

      takes position next to Rusty at the elevator shaft's
      bottom. They're on-camera, but just a few feet away and
      (off-camera) Danny sits smiling.

                              RUSTY

      FIRES a SPURT of BLANKS.

      BARRROOOOM! No one is hurt. Nor is the money, stacked
      neatly in a corridor, ready to be packed into the phony
      SWAT team bags, body armor, etc.


281   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (PRESENT)                        281

      The SWAT team exits and boards the second vehicle Turk
      and Virgil have been working on all this time, the one in
      the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from its
      rearview mirror: it's a replica of a SWAT van.

      Turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back.
      Rusty flips open another cell phone...

                               RUSTY
                Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer
                Brooks, New Jersey Probation
                Division. I have a violator in

                        (cupping phone)
                Hit it.

      Turk hits the gas and the VEHICLE PEELS away, carrying its
      cadre of new multi-millionaires far away from the
      Bellagio Hotel and Casino.

      Benedict squats down to inspect a burnt scrap of paper on
      the vault floor. It's a flier for a strip joint.

      Benedict straightens his cuffs, cools himself, then:

                   Open that door.


284   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM                                            284

      Bruiser throws a mean left hook across Danny's face as
      the door swings open and Benedict steps in. Bruiser sees
      him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles.

      Benedict studies Danny: the man is a bloody mess, head
      rolling, eyes puffed up.

                                  BENEDICT
                   Wake him up.

      The Goons step in, slap Danny alert.       At last, Danny
      recognizes Benedict in the room.

                                 DANNY
                          (a little punchy)
                   Heya, Benedict... How's the other
                   fight going?

      Benedict keeps his cool.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Did you have a hand in this?

                                 DANNY
                   Did I have a hand in what?

      Benedict scrutinizes Danny: Is he bluffing?       He looks at
      Bruiser, then Danny again, and decides: no.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Get him out of here.

      As the Goons scoop him up and drag him out, Danny catches
      Bruiser's eye for just a moment. And barely winks.

      what's his next step? Walsh approaches.

                   You get robbed or something,

                                 DANNY
                   Well, that's very interesting...
                          (beat)
                   ... but I didn't have anything to
                   do with it.

       He grins.   Benedict sinks.

                                  BENEDICT
                          (to his Goons)
                   Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit. And
                   contact the police. I would
                   imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation
                   of his parole.


289    INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE - ON TV                                  289

       The Goons haul Danny out. Tess has left, heartbeats ago:
       the room's door is just closing.


A290   INT. CAGE/HALLWAY                                              A290

                   Maybe we should have held him.

                                  BENEDICT
                   No.   Follow him. Everywhere.


290    INT. CASINO FLOOR - OUTSIDE CAGES                              290

       Benedict exits. Takes in his casino. It's been a bad
       night: he's down a hundred fifty million. He starts
       for...


291    INT. CASINO FLOOR - ELEVATOR BAY                               291

       As he arrives, the elevator doors open and Tess steps
       out. She breezes right past him.

                                    BENEDICT
                   Tess...
                             (as she doesn't
                              stop)
                   Tess?

                                 TESS
                   You of all people should know,
                   Terry: in your hotel, there's
                   always someone watching.

      She keeps going. Benedict, now down a hundred fifty
      million and one woman, boards the elevator. Its doors
      close on him.


292   EXT. ALLEY/VACANT WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING                     292

      The SWAT van rounds a corner and ducks inside the
      warehouse.

      Three-and-a-half seconds pass.

      And the eight SWAT members reappear, now all in suits,
      perfectly pressed, and with grins on their faces and
      change in their pockets, they begin their victory stroll,
      single-file and sloppy... right down the...


293   STRIP - MOVING WITH THEM                                        293

      Turk, Livingston, Frank, Basher, Yen, Saul, Linus and
      Rusty march down the strip single-file, and when they
      come to an intersection...

      ... Virgil and Reuben, also in suits, fall into stride
      for a victory lap in front of the Bellagio fountains.

      Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
      different hotels or grabbing cabs, until there are only
      two left: Rusty and Linus.

      They take each other in, shake hands, and part.


294   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                    294

      Tess exits, searching for Danny.   She rounds the building
      to...


295   EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE                                           295

      Where a LVPD squad car has just arrived to take goon-held
      Danny away. She runs toward it.

                                 TESS
                   Wait!

      They do. As Danny is handcuffed and prepared for loading
      in the back, he and Tess hold each other's glance.

                                 DANNY
                   I knew what I was doing.

      A beat.

                                   TESS
                   I didn't.

      A cop lowers Danny's head as he directs him into his
      seat.

                                 TESS
                   How long will you be?

                   Three to six months, I should
                   think.

      The squad car door closes him in and Tess stands vigil as
      it pulls away.


296   ACROSS STREET                                                   296

      Rusty watches Danny being driven back to prison, too.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


297   EXT. FRONT GATE - MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - DAY                 297

      SUPERIMPOSE:    THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER.

      The great metal gate opens once more, revealing Danny
      Ocean in its frame again, ready for release.

      He looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the
      view of New Jersey looks no brighter than it did before.
      He takes his first step into free America...

      ... to discover Rusty leaning against the prison wall.
      Beyond him sits his second-hand Mercedes from L.A.

                                 RUSTY
                   Looking for someone?

                                  DANNY
                   Thirteen million and you drive
                   that piece of shit cross country
                   to pick me up?

                                 RUSTY
                   Hello to you, too.

      They shakes hands.    Rusty looks Danny over.

                   Your hair's grayer.

                   Your eyes got closer together.
                          (beat)
                   How's life?

                                 RUSTY
                   Life... is a roomful of pillows.

                   C'mon...

      MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together
      again.

                                 RUSTY
                   Where do you want to go first?

                                   DANNY
                   To a phone.

      Rusty had anticipated this.

                                 RUSTY
                   I stopped and picked up your
                   personal effects, put them in the
                   back seat.

                                   DANNY
                   My what?

      Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see Tess
      sitting in the back. She smiles at him.

                                 DANNY
                          (smiling back,
                           then)
                   I'm not sure these belong to me.

                                   TESS
                   Sure they do.

      Danny and Rusty get in.      Danny kisses Tess.   Rusty STARTS
      the CAR.

                                 DANNY
                   We need to find Rusty a girl.

      his. Notices a silver wedding band on it.

                                 DANNY
                   You said you sold this.

                                 TESS
                   That's what I said.

      As they drive away...

      ... another car STARTS its ENGINE begins to follow.   At
      the wheel: Benedict's goons.

1    A MULTI-COLORED SCREEN                                      1

     After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the
     source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED
     TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches
     in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to:

1A   A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it    1A
     is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the
     truck is SHUT and we cut to:

1B   The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips    1B
     are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a
     wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest
     warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS--
     steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we
     were following disappear into a maze of synchronized
     activity.

1C   The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is             1C
     constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply
     raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards
     that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The
     striped tulips fetch a very high price.

1D   The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D
     sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end
     up on a truck heading for the airport.

1E   The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic
     flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold.

1F   The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an    1F
     airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane.

1G   The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a   1G
     truck. The truck drives through a small town and pulls into
     the back of a


2    EXT./INT. FLOWER SHOP -- DAY                                2

     A YOUNG MAN takes delivery of the flowers and carries them
     through the rear of the store to the display area up front.
     We stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation:

                         CUSTOMER
               Wow. How do they do that?

                        OWNER
              It's an accident. It means the
              flower developed a virus early
              in the bulb stage. The flaws
              create the unusual coloring.

                        CUSTOMER
              Can you arrange something for me
              with those?

                        OWNER
              Of course. What kind of price range
              are you looking for?

    Now we SEE the customer: TESS.

                        TESS
              Well, it's for my parent's
              anniversary. They don't know I'm
              coming. I just want it to be
              beautiful. Can you just do whatever
              you think looks best?

                        OWNER
              I'll need a few minutes.

                        TESS
              Take your time, please. And thank
              you.

    The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the
    flowers are arranged. Tess walks around, looking at the rest
    of the store.

    Tess looks out the window. A black sedan is pulling up at the
    curb.

                        OWNER
              That should be some surprise.

                        TESS
              Which?

                        OWNER
              For your parents.

                        TESS
              Oh. Yes. I hope so.

    One of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and
    crosses in front of the car. Tess starts moving away from the
    window.

              Which one is it?

              I'm sorry?

                        OWNER
              Anniversary.

                        TESS
              Oh. Fortieth

                        OWNER
              Wow. Okay. I think I have an idea.
              Something classic.

    The Power Twin opens the rear passenger side door, revealing
    TERRY BENEDICT.

    Tess turns away from the window.

                        TESS
              Do you have a bathroom?

                        OWNER
              Straight back, on the left. It's
              unisex.

                           TESS
              Thank you.

    Tess scurries to the back.

                        OWNER
                  (to Tess, a caveat)
              It's unisex!

    Tess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door. She
    pushes through it and runs right into Power Twin No. 2.

                                                      CUT TO:

    A nice place on the eastern seaboard. We hear the faint sound
    of a phone ring.

                                                                  4.



4   INT. HOUSE -- DAY                                             4

    Danny Ocean picks up the receiver, checks the caller ID. He
    smiles and answers:

                        DANNY
              Miguel Diaz speaking.

    Almost immediately, his expression clouds. He looks at his
    watch.

                        DANNY (cont'd)
              Tess, Tess. It's okay. You remember
              what we talked about, if this
              happened? All right. Call me in
              twenty-four hours on that number.

    He hangs up the phone and runs out of the house. He doesn't
    take anything with him.


5   EXT. HOUSE -- DAY                                             5

    Danny runs out of the house and down the street, leaving his
    car in the driveway.


6   INT. CAR -- DAY                                               6

    Tess, floral arrangement in her lap, sits in the car with
    Benedict.

                        BENEDICT
              The Baldwins.

                        TESS
              What about them?

                        BENEDICT
              We had dinner with them three years
              ago. You talked about your parent's
              anniversary.

    She says nothing.

                        BENEDICT (cont'd)
              I'm getting married next month.

                         TESS
              So am I.

     A beat.

                         BENEDICT
               Well, I hope Danny is as good as he
               thinks he is. A bouquet toss in
               prison can get pretty ugly.


7    INT. BANK VAULT -- DAY                                        7

     Danny takes a safe deposit box out of a wall, He opens the

9    INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                      9

     The landscape hurtles by. We pan over to find Danny sitting
     next to the window. We continue to pan and find REUBEN
     TISHKOFF seated next to a group of male commuters.

                          REUBEN
                   (over)
               I really think you're being too
               sensitive. She's crazy about you. I
               can tell.


10   INT. SPA -- DAY                                              10

     REUBEN lies in a mud bath, his face covered with a dried
     exfoliating "mask" treatment. There is a cigar in one hand
     and a cellphone in the other. His eyes are closed to the sun.

                          REUBEN
               Joyce, she's ninety-two. I'm all

               The wheelchair thing was an

               I told you, when her mouth hangs

               You're tired because you work too
               much. You don't have to work all
               the time. Don't you want to take a
               break? Those trays look so heavy.
                   (beat)
               Of course. How could you ask that?

               Because when I heard you laugh, all
               my problems disappeared.

     A SHADOW crosses over Reuben's face, and Reuben squints open
     one eye. There, with the sun like an aura behind his head, is
     TERRY BENEDICT.


11   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                    11

     Reuben is handed a bloody mary by the porter, who then
     continues on, bringing a glass of white wine to THE AMAZING
     YEN.


12   INT. POOL -- DAY                                            12

     Yen swims a strong, steady freestyle. Pull back to reveal
     that he is swimming in a 9' by 5' "Endless Pool" in his 15th
     floor Shanghai apartment.

     A HAND MOVES INTO FRAME and turns off the water current. Yen
     immediately slams into the end of his jacuzzi-sized pool. He
     lifts his head out of the water to SEE the POWER TWINS
     standing "poolside."

     He spits out a stream of invective, in Chinese. The Power
     Twins look at each other.


13   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                    13

     Yen sets his magazine down and heads for the bathroom, where
     TURK and VIRGIL MALLOY are waiting in line.

                         TURK
               The opening doesn't work.

                         VIRGIL
               Duh.

                         TURK
               She shouldn't have the same dream
               as Franklin. He's the antagonist.

                         VIRGIL
               It was your idea.

                         TURK
               No it wasn't.

                         VIRGIL
               Well, it wasn't mine. It couldn't
               be; it's too stupid.

                         TURK
               Why do you do that? why do you have
               to get personal?

                         VIRGIL
               It's not personal, it's a fact.


14   INT. YOGA STUDIO -- DAY                                   14

     VIRGIL and TURK MALLOY, in GTX lycra yoga gear lead a class
     (mostly female) through the vinyassa. The studio is mirrored
     on three sides.

                         TURK
               It's personal. You don't argue
               logically. You attack.
                   (to the class)
               Bring the right foot back even with
               the left, buttocks raised high....
                   (to Virgil)
               ...you have to have reasons, to
               support your argument...
                   (to the class)
               ...flattening the back so the body
               forms a triangle.

                         VIRGIL
               I can't listen to you anymore. It
               makes me physically sick.

     Turk looks to him, but also sees a GUY in the class staring
     at all of the women "raising their buttocks high". He
     indicates this to Virgil, who goes over to the guy.

                         TURK
               Relax the crown of the head toward
               the floor. Draw the hips away from
               the hands, len--gthening the spine.
               And press the heels toward the floor.

     Virgil steps on the guy's back and leans down to whisper in
     his ear.

                            VIRGIL
                  This a serious class. No pigs
                  allowed. Okay?

                            GUY
                  Sorry.

                            TURK
                  Virge.

     Virgil stands up. Benedict and the Power Twins are standing
     right behind him. His expression changes as he sees them in
     the mirror.


15   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  15

     The Malloys and Yen are still waiting for the bathroom.

                            TURK
                  You're hallucinating.

                            VIRGIL
                  Yeah, whatever, OJ.

     Finally, the lock OPENS and RUSTY RYAN exits. We follow him
     to his seat, where he puts on a pair of headphones.


16   TIGHT SHOT                                                16

     Of molten metal bubbling in a small iron cask, a jeweler's
     cask. MOVE to REVEAL a GARAGE filled mostly with cars in some
     state of restoration

     FIND RUSTY as he painstakingly works on a new piece that is
     just BELOW FRAME. Whatever it is, it is clearly getting to
     him. He shakes his head; it's not right. It's just not good
     enough. Rusty glances at the digital thermometer attached to
     the cask of molten metal. It reads: 736.18 degrees.

                            RUSTY
                  You are kidding me.

                                                                   9.



17   INT. RUSTY'S CAR -- DAY                                     17

     Rusty glances in his rearview as he drives through the city
     talking on his cell phone. He's keeping an eye on a white
     Cadillac that seem to be following him.

                         RUSTY
               736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix.
               I watched it.

                         FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               Rusty. What do you want from me?

     Rusty turns a corner, then glances in his rearview again.

                         RUSTY
               I want what I paid for.

                         FELIX
               And that's what I sent.

                         RUSTY
               No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And
               if my workshop were on top of Mount
               Everest it would be pure. But I'm
               at sea level, Felix, and at sea
               level it should liquefy at 736.95.
               If it's pure, that is. Which this
               isn't.

     Rusty makes another turn. A few seconds later, the Cadillac
     turns behind him.

                         FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               Well, I didn't know you were going
               to liquefy it.

     Rusty pulls to a stop light. The Cadillac pulls up three cars
     behind him.

                         RUSTY
               Let me ask you something: When
               Christo calls his cotton supplier
               and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do
               you think his supplier sends him
               98% cotton and 2% polyester and
               when that doesn't work, says to
               Christo, "Well, you should have
               told me you were going to wrap the
               coast of Australia"?

                         FELIX
               Who's Christo?

     Rusty looks to the heavens.

                         RUSTY
               Felix, you're in a shame spiral.
               Have your assistant lose my number.

     Rusty snaps his phone shut.

                         RUSTY (cont'd)
               My god.

     Rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car
     to a stop. He gets out of his car and slams the door shut.
     He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window. It
     rolls down electronically to reveal Benedict.

                         RUSTY (contd)
               How long you gonna give us?


18   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  18

     Rusty continues to listen to his headset. We pan over to see
     FRANK CATTON seated opposite him.


19   INT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL, NEW YORK -- DAY                  19

     The penthouse apartment. It takes the entire floor and has a
     360 degree view. Right now, all of the furniture inside of it
     is being taken away by movers. Frank enters frame.

               We stole that money fair and
               square. You bought people off to
               find me. You took advantage during
               an economic downturn, and made them
               say some shit they shouldn't have
               said. It's not fair, it's not just,
               and it aint' cool.

     A long beat. Benedict stares back at him.

21    INT. STAGE -- NIGHT                                         21

      Livingston performs a stand-up routine.

                          LIVINGSTON
                How many people here tonight were
                stupid enough to have children?

      A few people raise their hands.

                          LIVINGSTON (cont'd)
                Wow. No, seriously, that's great. I
                have a child. A daughter. She's
                five. They get to you, right? Am I
                right? Like emotionally. I mean,
                sometimes she'll turn to me with
                her little face and her little
                shiny eyes, and she'll say, "Daddy,
                please stop hitting me," and it
                just breaks my heart.'

      People aren't sure what to make of this.

                          LIVINGSTON (cont'd)
                I'm Livingston Dell. Thanks for
                listening. See you at ten.

      Livingston strides off stage as we see that he is at the
      Bellagio, in the lounge. Benedict and the Power Twins are
      waiting for him. Somehow he isn't surprised.

                          LIVINGSTON (cont'd)
                    (to Benedict)
                I appreciate you letting me finish
                my run. You've been very patient.

                          BENEDICT
                What can I say? You're a funny guy.

                                                               12.



22   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  22

     Livingston takes us to Saul Bloom, reading the Racing Form.


23   INT. THE WASPIEST IMAGINABLE MEN'S CLUB -- DAY            23

     All dark wood and oriental rugs. MOVE across a row of oil
     paintings that flatter stodgy club members from the 1800s to
     the present. Land on Saul, sitting in window light that
     mimics the aforementioned portraits.

                         SAUL
               What it is about horses? I ask you.
               Is it the strength? The beauty? The
               fearlessness? The grace? Of course.
               But there's something else.
               Something in the eyes.

     The person with him nods.

                         SAUL (cont'd)
               Yes. When I look into a horse's
               eyes, I can tell: This one's a
               winner.

     A jacketed WAITER appears, holding a tray.

                         WAITER
               Excuse me, Mr. Bloom?

                         SAUL
               Yes?

                          WAITER
               There appears to be a problem with
               your card.

     The waiter tips the tray to reveal Saul's credit card, which
     has been CUT INTO TINY PIECES. Without missing a beat, he
     reaches for his wallet.

                         SAUL
               You take Visa?

                         WAITER
               I was acting on instructions from
               your business manager.

                         SAUL
               My business manager?

               Mr. Benedict.


24   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                    24

     Saul leads us to Basher.


25   INT. RECORDING STUDIO -- NIGHT                              25

     Basher is putting the finishing touches on a song. A producer
     and engineer sit behind a huge mixing console. It's good--
     Basher's really got something going here.


26   INT. RECORDING BOOTH -- MOMENTS LATER                       26

     Basher is leaning over a thick legal document, and Benedict
     is leaning over him. The music has been turned off.

                         BENEDICT
               Look at it this way...Eugene....if
               the album goes platinum it'll cover
               what you owe. And if the second one
               goes gold, that should cover the
               interest.


27   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                    27

     Basher takes us to Linus.


28   INT. CAR -- DAY                                             28

     Linus looking from the front seat to the back, talking to
     Benedict.

                         LINUS
               I'm responsible for myself. I have
               my own life and my own plans. I've
               never asked for anything but a fair
               shake. We make a deal, I stick to
               the deal.

     He turns forward, thinking. Then after a beat, he turns back
     to Benedict.

28   CONTINUED:                                                    28


                         LINUS (cont'd)
               I just need to be absolutely clear
               that we have an understanding: If
               you contact my father, I'll kill
               myself, and you'll never get the
               rest of your money.

     Benedict nods. Linus turns forward and exhales, relieved.


29   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                     29

     Linus takes us back to Danny. The train hurtles onward.

                                                        CUT TO:


30   ABSOLUTE BEDLAM                                              30

     Reuben, Yen, the Malloys, Frank, Livingston, Saul, Basher,
     and Linus are all talking at once -- right at us. Right at
     Danny. And they are not happy.

     The group is in an abandoned WAREHOUSE somewhere near NYC.

     Danny is overwhelmed, like a deer caught in the headlights.
     He throws a desperate glance at Rusty, who's looking out the
     window serenely, letting Danny flounder.


31   MOMENTS LATER                                                31

     Total silence. Everyone just stares at Danny, waiting for an
     answer.

                         DANNY
               How many can't make the deadline?

     Everyone raises their hands except Reuben.

                         REUBEN
                   (off their looks)
               So I'm smarter than those schmucks
               on Wall Street. Whose fault is that?

     Fair enough.

                         DANNY
               How many think if they run, they'll
               be found?

31   CONTINUED:                                                   31


     Everyone raises their hands. Including Reuben. Danny gets up,
     walks over to Rusty.

     The rest of the guys shrug and begin talking amongst
     themselves.

     After a long beat.

                         DANNY (cont'd)
               Well, the only other--

                         RUSTY
               We're on the five o'clock.

                            DANNY
               Good.

     A beat.

                            DANNY (cont'd)
               Where?

                            RUSTY
               Amsterdam.

     Danny steps back.

                         DANNY
               AMSTERDAM!?

     Danny's tone draws everyone's attention. Noticing this, Danny
     and Rusty move into a nearby dilapidated office doorway.

     The guys go back to talking, mostly about what they were
     doing when they were found. This rises steadily in volume
     until the din is obliterated by a LOUD VOICE:

                         DANNY (cont'd)
               I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS A DEATH
               SENTENCE!

                         RUSTY
               FINE, THEN STAY HERE!

     The guys exchange glances. Danny walks over to them and
     sighs.

                                                        CUT TO:

               Flight 144 to Amsterdam.

               You're in seat 43J. Enjoy your
               flight.

                         LIVINGSTON
               Uh...there must be some mistake. I
               mean...unless...is your first class
               section in the back of the plane?

     The agent looks back at him, confused.

                            KLM AGENT
               No.

     JUMP CUT TO the agent handing Linus his boarding pass:

               You made the seats smaller. Can you

     JUMP CUT to show Frank:

                         FRANK
               See, you're not hearing me. What
               I'm trying to tell you is the
               reservations agent made a mistake
               when she issued the ticket, because
               on the rare occasions that I fly
               commercially, I always book a first-
               class ticket with no restrictions--

     The desk agent looks back at him skeptically.

                         KLM AGENT
               She may have, air, but this is the
               only ticket available to you on
               this flight. I need you to step
               aside so I can take care of the
               next customer.

                         FRANK
               Now, listen: Don't make me get
               black.


33   INT. SECURITY AREA                                        33

     Frank stands with his arm outstretched, shoes and belt off.
     Two TSA officers run metal detecting wands over every inch of
     his body. Three more guys pick through his luggage: they
     squeeze toothpaste from his Sensodyne tube, sniff his hair
     products, unroll his "tighty-whitey" briefs....

     PAN to REVEAL that Basher is getting the exact same
     treatment, right next to him. They exchange looks.

     REVERSE ANGLE: the rest of the group stands sipping iced
     lattes from Starbucks and watching the show. Reuben walks up.

                          DANNY
               Reuben.

                         REUBEN
               I wanted to wish you luck. And
               listen: I want to do something
               for you.

     Reuben hands Danny an envelope.

                         DANNY
               What's this?

               Take it. Take it. This is the
               least I can do. I've got a friend
               who owns the Bellagio of Amsterdam
               and I've made reservations for all
               of you there. It's all taken care
               of.

                         RUSTY
               That's very touching, Reuben.

                         REUBEN
               It's the least I could do. I love
               you guys. Enjoy.

     Yen says something in Chinese.

               No, thank you.


34   INT. 747 -- NIGHT                                           34

     Yen sits in First Class, playing an in-seat video. Virgil and
     Turk kneel on either side, watching his progress.

                            VIRGIL
               Nice.

                         TURK
               Great anticipation.

                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT
               Gentlemen, you'll have to go back
               to your seats now.

     Reluctantly, they do. We follow them back to coach, where
     they pass Linus, talking to himself.

                          LINUS
               Ground level. First floor. Day one.

               Planning stages.

     We move on to find Livingston, who grabs Turk by the arm.

                         LIVINGSTON
               How'd he get that seat?

                            TURK
               What seat?

     Turk moves on, taking us past a sleeping Saul and landing on
     Danny and Rusty, who watch a movie with fixed expressions. A
     reverse angle shows us that the video screen is twenty rows
     away--it is impossible to discern any detail at all. Rusty
     takes his headphones off and exhales. Danny notices this and
     does the same. After a beat:

                         RUSTY
               Call me an elitist asshole, call me
               a bourgeois clown, call me anything
               you want, but 'economy' is
               bullshit.

                         DANNY
               Oh, I don't know...it's not that ba-

     The guy in front of Danny moves his seat back suddenly and
     spills Danny's drink all over Danny's lap.

     Linus approaches Danny and Rusty.

                         LINUS
               Hey. You guys have a minute?

                         DANNY
               Sure, Linus.

                         RUSTY
               What's on your mind?

                         LINUS
               Well, I know this may not be the
               exact right time to bring this up,
               but I've been thinking
               about...well, about where I want to
               be in five years, career-wise, and
               I've decided I really want to be
               more than just a role-player. I
               really see myself as kind of an
               idea man, like you guys. I mean, I
               know you do your part and you're in
               the trenches with us and all, but
               it's really your show, and like I
               said, five years from now, I want
               to be running my own show....

     Danny and Rusty exchange a look...then look back at Linus.

                         LINUS
               So if there's any opportunity for
               me to be involved in the, you know,
               planning stages of things, I would
               really appreciate it. I really feel
               like I'm ready for more
               responsibility and that I could
               really make a contribution.

     Rusty turns to Danny.

                         RUSTY
               Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

                            DANNY
               Evelyn.

                         RUSTY
                   (to Linus)
               We're negotiating the terms with
               her tomorrow. You feel up to
               taking the lead?

                         LINUS
               Are you serious?

                         DANNY
               Absolutely.

                         LINUS
               This isn't some gag?

                            RUSTY
               No gag.

                         LINUS
               Wow. Yeah. That would be awesome.

                         DANNY
               Okay, then.

                         LINUS
               Man. I wasn't sure if I should say
               anything. Now I'm glad I did.

                            DANNY
               So are we.

                         RUSTY
               We're here to listen.

               Great. Thanks. Really. You won't
               regret this.

     Linus leaves. Danny and Rusty put their headphones back on.
     Now they look content.

     Basher and Frank watch Linus go.

                         BASHER
               Tom.

                         SAUL
               He can be a Tom?

                         BASHER
               Anybody can be a Tom.

                          SAUL
               You gotta make your own
               opportunities. This ain't a
               rehearsal.

                         BASHER
               Tom.

     Saul chews his economy class trail mix.

                         SAUL
               Boy, you're tough.

                         BASHER
               Stop calling me "boy".

     Saul stops chewing. They look at each other.

     They have stopped in front of a narrow townhouse that has
     been converted to a hotel. The sign says "Bellagio of
     Amsterdam."


37   INT. BELLAGIO OF AMSTERDAM -- DAY                             37

     A single room with 12 bunks in it. Their noses are wrinkled
     up because the place stinks.

                         LIVINGSTON
               How could he lie to us like that?

                         RUSTY
               The sign said 'the Bellagio of
               Amsterdam'.

     Everyone looks at each other and turns to leave.

                         LINUS (?)
               Wait a minute. That's it?

                         DANNY
               Yeah.

                         LINUS
               Look, you guys no frills, no perks,
               run-and-gun, all that stuff, and I
               said no problem because I believed
               you were right that we shouldn't go
               deeper into debt and spend money we
               don't have. I mean, am I the only
               one who thinks this might actually
               be a good thing? That we could use
               a little humility? That maybe we
               were a little too pleased and
               impressed with ourselves after the
               Benedict job? Okay, I grant you
               that maybe this isn't what we
               deserve, but maybe it's what we
               need. We can do this. No, I take it
               back: We have to do this.

     A long beat.

     doorman who rushed over to take it for him.

     Tess talks to Danny. Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN is
     parked.

                         TESS
               What are you doing in Amsterdam?

                         DANNY (PHONE V.O)
               Only what I have to do to get
               Benedict off our backs.

                         TESS
               Be careful, Danny. Please.

                         DANNY
               How's work?

                         TESS
               It's the same. I'm distracted.

                            DANNY
               I'm sorry.

                         TESS
               It's not your fault.

                         DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               I keep trying to figure out what I
               did wrong. How did he find us?

     Tess can't bring herself to tell Danny the truth, that it was
     entirely her fault.

                         TESS
               Danny, don't keep thinking about
               it.

                         DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               I did something wrong. He should
               never have found us.

43   EXT. AMSTERDAM COFFEE HOUSE -- DAY                           43

     Danny and Rusty lead an obviously eager Linus towards a
     coffee house.

                         RUSTY
               She'll try and use her looks to
               distract you. Don't let her.

                         DANNY
               Be polite, but firm.

                           LINUS
               Right.

                         RUSTY
               Don't get soft on us. Don't make
               too many concessions.

                           LINUS
               I won't.

     Danny and Rusty nod. Okay.


44   INT. COFFEE HOUSE -- CLOSE ON EVELYN.                        44

     Who is obviously a MAN IN DRAG.

     Linus looks to Danny and Rusty but they give him nothing.

                         EVELYN
               The onset of summer is like a woman
               who owns too many shoes.

     She/He looks to Linus, who looks to Danny and Rusty.

                         DANNY
                   (bailing Linus out)
               If animals were capable of
               flattery, the World Bank would be
               open until 8pm.

                         EVELYN
               When I was four years old, I saw my
               mother kill a spider with a tea cozy.

     Again, the Evelyn looks to Linus, who has nothing to say.

                         RUSTY
               A doctor who specializes in skin
               diseases will dream that he has
               fallen asleep in front of the
               television. Later he will wake up
               in front of the television but not
               remember his dream.

     Evelyn nods and looks to Linus, as do Danny and Rusty. He
     furrows his brow, then speaks:

                         LINUS
               O let the sun beat down upon my
               face, stars to fill my dreams. I
               am a traveler of both time and
               space, to be where I have been.

     Danny and Rusty stare at Linus like he's nuts, like he's just
     cracked. Evelyn's entire expression changes.

                         EVELYN
               Your young friend has a great deal
               to learn about respect.

     She/He puts his/her drink down and walks to another part of
     the establishment.

                         DANNY
               Linus...why don't you wait outside.

     Rusty and Danny follow Evelyn and quietly console him/her.

                                                                 26.



45   EXT. COFFEE HOUSE -- AFTERWARD -- DAY                       45

     Linus cools his heels.   Danny and Rusty emerge from inside.

                         DANNY
               Is that your idea of making a
               contribution?

                         RUSTY
               Her terms were scandalous. And we
               were lucky to get them after what
               you said.

                         DANNY
               The deal was this close to being
               blown.

                          LINUS
               "Deal?"   What "deal?"

     Danny and Rusty just look at him.

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               I know what you guys are doing.

     Danny and Rusty exhange looks. What?

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               Look. That...person had too many
               cupcakes.

     They just keep staring at him.

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               I was playing along.

                         RUSTY
               "Playing along!"

                         DANNY
               You called her mother a whore.

                         RUSTY
               A really cheap one.

                         LINUS
               Guys, I'm not falling for this.
               I'm not....

     But Danny and Rusty aren't laughing.    They look pissed.
     Seriously pissed.

               I called her mother a whore?


46   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                             46

     Danny and Rusty explain the job to the group.

                         RUSTY
               It's a privately owned home. But
               don't let that fool you. It's
               extremely well-protected.

     A photo of a four-story canal house is displayed on a flat
     screen connected to Livingston's computer.

                         SAUL
               What are we after?

                         DANNY
               A document. A very old, very
               valuable document.

     A photo labeled "The Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift" is
     displayed on screen.

                         VIRGIL
               What is it?

                         RUSTY
               A stock certificate.

                         DANNY
               The first one ever issued, from the
               first corporation on the planet.
               The Dutch East India Trading
               Company. It's the only one of it's
               kind and it's worth a boat-load.

                         TURK

               Thanks.

                         LIVINGSTON
               What do we know so far?

                         DANNY
               There's a dummy key pad by the
               front door.
                   (points to a diagram)
               But the alarm is really controlled
               by the keypad in Mr.
               Vanderspeigle's second floor
               office. Now, here's good news: we
               already know the system's master
               code. Evelyn gave it to us.

                          FRANK
               That's not good news, that's really
               good news.

                         VIRGIL
               We just wait until he leaves.

                         DANNY
               Yeah, well...that's the bad news.

                         RUSTY
               He doesn't.

     Frank flinches. Doesn't like what he's hearing.

                         DANNY
               He's agoraphobic.

                Cracks his windows at
                night...that's about it.

      When Vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins
      fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than
      a few inches.

                          LIVINGSTON (V.O.)
                Can we tap into the system from the
                outside through the phone lines?

                          RUSTY (V.O.)
                Negative. It's a closed-loop
                system with two redundant servers
                locked into titanium cases in the
                guy's bedroom.

                Guys, am I missing something here?
                We know his damn code, right?
                You're telling me with that much

               The street in front of the house is

     The rest of the room agrees. Matter closed.    Everyone just

               It's always about you, isn't it?

                         DANNY
               This like running toward a cliff.
               Speaking of which, how's Isabel?

                         RUSTY
               I have no idea what you're talking
               about.

                         DANNY
               You get the tattoo removed?

                         RUSTY
               Given its location, my doctor
               advised against it.

     Rusty stops walking. Danny continues, then notices he is
     alone. He turns back to Rusty.

                         DANNY
               What are you doing?

                         RUSTY
               We're here.

                         DANNY
               Oh.

     As Danny and Rusty enter the hotel, Rusty trips on the steps.

                         DANNY
               Nice.

     Rusty bends down to look at the step. He notices that one
     tile on the edge of the stop has lost some mortar. He touches
     the tile and watches the lip rise up and down, up and down,
     as though it's cantilevered.

               Tilt it. Raise it slightly.

                         SAUL
               The whole house?

                         RUSTY
               It's only a few inches.

                         BASHER
               Then I'll have line-of-sight.

                         FRANK
               We can't tilt a whole house.

                         VIRGIL
               They did it with the Leaning Tower
               of Pisa.

                          RUSTY
               Exactly.

                         SAUL
               It took three hundred guys two
               years to do that. You're crazy.
               Nobody's ever done anything like
               this.

                         RUSTY
               Not true. Palowski did it in `64
               in Venice and `73 in Istanbul.

                          SAUL
               Really?

                         LIVINGSTON
               And he only had a crew of six.

                         RUSTY
               There are thirty pylons. We cut
               them, insert the jacks, and crank.

               For nineteen hours. Here's the
               order in which they have to be

56   EXT. VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                          56

     It is pouring rain. From across the canal, we MOVE towards
     Vanderspeigle's house, favoring a barge moored just out
     front. Then, instead of moving over the barge, we PUSH
     THROUGH its hull to--

     FIND Frank and Livingston inside manning a series of
     industrial water pumps. They're grimy and covered in sweat.
     Rain drips through the deck above them.

                         LIVINGSTON
               So, Basher approached me about
               being on a crew.

                            FRANK
               When?

                            LIVINGSTON
               Yesterday.

     Frank thinks about that.

     Yen pops his head out from a small tube and says something in
     Chinese.

     Frank shrugs...doesn't understand. Yen tries again.... This
     time he enunciates very clearly and talks very loudly (like
     Americans do when foreigners don't understand English).

     Frank nods, starts turning the handle of the water pump in
     the opposite direction. Yen climbs down out of the tube.
     Then he climbs back up the tube. He picks up a jack in the
     corner. Climbs back in the tube.


58   INT. UNDER VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                     58

     We FOLLOW him as he climbs through the tube and emerges
     underneath Vanderspeigle's house, inside its foundation.

     The thirty pylons extend from the base of the house into the
     into the swamp it sits atop of. There is little space
     between the swamp level and the house.   Runoff from the rain
     outside drips everywhere.

     FIND Danny and Rusty struggling to place a hand-cranked jack
     into a freshly cut space in one of the timber pylons. They
     are covered in muck and grime

                         RUSTY
               The good news is, after the first
               twelve hours, I stopped being able
               to smell anything.

                         DANNY
               Took a few more for me.

                          RUSTY
               This water was stagnant six hundred
               years ago.

     FIND the Malloys, thirty feet away, using a fancy underwater
     saw to cut a space in another pylon. Because the cutting is
     taking place underwater it is extremely quiet.

                         VIRGIL
               There's no reason for him not to.
               He would go to the cops.

                         TURK
               Okay, so he goes to the cops.

                         VIRGIL
               Then they arrest Dominique.

                         TURK.
               Right.

                         VIRGIL
               Then we have no story.

                         TURK

               She steals the money from Mr.
               Mulroney.

     They turn to look at Linus, sawing nearby.

               What?

               To pay Franklin to keep quiet.

     Turk and Virgil think about that. Linus keeps sawing.

                         TURK
               That's good.

               I have to tell you, it's not
               something I condone. It's cheating.

                         BASHER
               It is cheating.

                         SAUL
               There's no subtlety to it.

                         BASHER
               It's kind of embarrassing.

                         SAUL
               No one I know...

               I can't imagine anything like that.

     A long beat. Then each of them reach into their jackets and
     produce $20 bills. They exchange and examine the bills
     closely by eye. Satisfied, they trade them again and return
     them to their coat pockets.

               I told him about you.

               I'm too old. That's dangerous. My
               stuff is cheap compared to that.
               It's just me and my gal, you know.

     barely.

     He steadies himself. Saul knows that he's ready to take the

     A MALE SECRETARY (HESS) rushes through Europol's

65   INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY                                          65

     Europol Agent ISABEL LAHIRI gives a presentation to seventy-
     five of her colleagues. With her on stage are a couple of
     seated HIGHER-UP TYPES. She's nervous.

                         ISABEL
               Let's discuss, briefly and to
               begin, with the category of
               "thieves", as distinguished from
               the larger category of what might
               be termed "hardened" criminals.
               The highest level, "master
               thieves," if you will, is a very
               small world. Between six and ten
               high-level crews are operating in
               Europe at any given time.
               Worldwide, no more than twenty. The
               most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is
               either dead or retired, and the
               expectation is that no one will
               replace him. The good news is the
               trend is toward their extinction.

     The secretary enters the auditorium and walks toward the
     podium.

                         ISABEL
               For example: Anecdotal evidence
               suggest these people are personally
               insufferable.

     The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say?

                         ISABEL
               Their egos demand constant praise,
               and they embellish their exploits
               to anyone who will listen. They
               tell their own stories endlessly,
               provided of course, they are
               talking to a fellow thief or an
               intimate.

     Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering
     if this is appropriate.

                         ISABEL
               Those who interact with them on a
               personal level are relegated to
               positions of total servitude, with
               no chance for growth or freedom.
               Their lives are treated as
               secondary. Many of them suffer from
               depression. It's a crime for which
               there is no law, and yet causes
               untold damage.

     One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say something,
     but by now Hess the Male Secretary has reached Isabel and
     interrupts her by whispering into her ear. She balances.

               WHAT?


66   INT. EUROPOL HEADQUARTERS -- LONG SHOT -- DAY                66

     Isabel and Hess walk briskly through the ultra-modern
     hallway. He briefs her as they walk in a hushed voice. Then
     something he says stops her in her tracks.

     Hess continues to explain something we can't hear. Then he
     pulls out some PHOTOS. Isabel leafs through them.

                         ISABEL
               That's impossible!


67   EXT. VANDERSPEIGLE HOUSE -- CRIME SCENE -- DAY             67

     Isabel arrives and is greeted by PAUL, a lead detective
     working the Vanderspeigle theft for the Amsterdam police
     department.

                         PAUL
               Thanks for coming. We can really
               use your help on this one.

     His partner looks over at Isabel, who is wearing a skirt and
     pretty damn good shoes. The guy checks out her legs and looks
     away.

                         ISABEL
               I hope the scene hasn't been
               contaminated.

     Isabel walks away. Moments later, she enters the house with
     the lead detective.


68   INT. VANDERSPEIGLE HOUSE - DAY                             68

     As soon as she's inside she's all business.

                         ISABEL
               No forced entry.

                         PAUL
               Not that we can find.


69   UPSTAIRS -- VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOME OFFICE                    69

     Isabel looks around Vanderspeigle's home office.   Behind a
     fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe. In
     the other direction is Vanderspeigle's bedroom.

                          PAUL
                   (nods)
               We can't figure out how they
               disabled the alarm. We thought
               maybe they tried to short it out
               somehow.




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               45.
69   CONTINUED:                                                 69


                         ISABEL
               No, that would have triggered the
               system.

     Isabel goes to the alarm pad. Pulls the face plate off,
     examines the inside.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               And damaged the circuits.

                         PAM
               Well, then I don't know how they
               got in.

                         ISABEL
               They had to have known the code.

     She moves on to look in the mark's BEDROOM.

                         PAUL
                   (calls to her)
               We considered that, but the mark
               swears that nobody in the world
               knew the code except him. He
               programmed the last seven steps of
               the system himself. He set it and
               never left the house again. When he
               dies, we'll probably have to
               physically cut all the power lines
               to the house to get it off line.

     Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which
     was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedroom
     closet. She answers the detective almost as an afterthought.

                         ISABEL
               There are other ways to get the
               code.
                   (to herself)
               Closed loop. Redundant servers.
               Titanium encasement. Not bad.

     The lead detective enters the bedroom.

                            PAUL
               Like what?

     Again, Isabel is inside her own mind. She's really just
     answering the detective's questions out of courtesy.

                         ISABEL
               Uh...well, they probably set up in
               a house across the canal and
               watched him type the code in
               through a pair of binoculars.

     We GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office. He stands
     at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. He
     twists around and looks out the window behind him.

                         PAUL
                   (calling to Isabel in the
                    bedroom)
               Actually, I don't know about that.

     Isabel re-enters the office.

                         PAUL (cont'd)
               Unless he had a habit of typing in
               the code like this--

     He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type
     in the numbers. It's an obviously unnatural position. Then
     he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one
     normally would.

                         PAUL (cont'd)
               --then his body would block the
               view from across the canal.

                         ISABEL
               That's why they probably set up
               over there--

     She points out an adjacent window on another wall.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               --And used the mirror.

     She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The
     detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the
     keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly
     across the canal into another house.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen
               hundred millimeter lens to get a
               clear shot but--

     But Isabel's already moved on. Something has caught her
     attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that
     is shinier than the paint that surrounds it.


                                                          (CONTINUED)

69   CONTINUED: (3)                                              69


     Isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches
     the shiny area. When she pulls her finger away there is
     paint on it.

     Isabel cocks her head.


70   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    70

     A black-clad thief (LINUS) uses a paint brush to touch up the
     wall above the alarm keypad.


71   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           71

     The lead detective watches Isabel intently.

                          PAUL
                What is it?

     Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from
     Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the
     paint. The plaster there is soft and wet. In fact it isn't
     plaster at all. It's spackle.

                          PAUL (cont'd)
                What is that?

     Isabel cooks her head again.


72   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    72

     THUNK!   A crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel.


73   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           73

                          ISABEL
                It's where the crossbow bolt hit.

                          PAUL
                A crossbow bolt?

                          ISABEL
                Ever heard of Franz Schuman?

                          PAUL
                No.

     Isabel is at the window. The one that Vanderspeigle leaves
     cracked open every night. Isabel looks across the canal at
     the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards.

                         ISABEL
               They would have fired from that
               roof. Through this open window.

     Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure
     she's correct.

                          PAUL
               From that roof, through this
               window? Nobody could make a shot
               like that.

                         ISABEL
               Not a cop, anyway.

                         PAUL
               What's that supposed to mean?

                         ISABEL
               Sorry. Your friend downstairs put
               me in a bad mood.

                         PAUL
               He's an idiot. You shouldn't let
               him bother you.

                         ISABEL
               Yes. You're right.

     Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene
     `Basher' Tarr." There are two names above Basher's in her
     little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean."

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               But these man are exceptionally
               good. Even when they make mistakes.


74   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                      74

     A bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the
     wall above the alarm pad. Two thin wires are attached to a
     tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. The
     wires run back to the window of the apartment across the
     canal.

     Inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel
     which is mounted on a large tripod for stability.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

     In effect the group now has a mini-clothesline running
     between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal.

     Livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over
     the number pad of Vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline"
     that runs across the canal.


75   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                               75

     Isabel writes: "Livingston Dell?" Underneath Basher's name in
     her notebook.


76   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                        76

     Livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through
     Vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel.
     Magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place
     over the top of the keypad.   Livingston then types a six-
     digit code into a remote keypad. His keypunches are mimicked
     by the remote device. Vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off.

     Downstairs: From inside we see the front door lock picked.
     The door swings open.


77   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                               77

     Isabel nods her head. There's a slight smile on her face.
     The smile of admiration, respect in another's skills.

                            ISABEL
                  When did he get up and notice the
                  certificate was gone?

                            PAUL
                  The alarm woke him at 4:2O am.

                            ISABEL
                  But the alarm would have been--

     She stops.    And smiles to herself.

                            ISABEL (cont'd)
                  Oh... Oh, I know what happened.

                            PAUL
                  What?

     Isabel quickly glances around the room.       Her eye lands on the
     floor near the false bookcase.

     On some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards
     meet.   She kneels down for a closer look.

                           ISABEL
                 There was someone else.

                           PAUL
                 Someone else.


78   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                     78

     Danny and Rusty come through the front door. They are
     followed by Linus. All of them are soaking wet from 24 hours
     in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the
     pouring rain outside the front door. The group silently
     slips up the stairs.

                           ISABEL (V.O.)
                 Oh, I wish I could've have seen
                 that.


79   INT. VANDERSPEIGLE OFFICE - NIGHT                           79

     They enter Vanderspeigle's office. You can hear him snoring
     in the other room. Danny and Rusty quickly, carefully remove
     the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window.
     They drop it (and the attached wires) to the Malloys, who are
     waiting on the street below.

     Meanwhile Linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over
     the spackle.

     Danny and Rusty turn to see that Linus is finished. They
     hand-signal each other like Special Forces guys do, then move
     towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.

                            ISABEL (V.O.)
                 That must have really been
                 something.

     Suddenly:

                            DANNY
                 Wait!   Wait! Shhhh!

     Everyone freezes. Danny puts his hand up to his ear to try
     to listen for the sound he thought he heard. We hear the
     faint sound of somebody singing to themselves.

     Danny and Rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the
     bookcase. What the hell?


                                                       (CONTINUED)

     They yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome
     Frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of
     Vanderspeigle's safe.

     Danny and Rusty stare at him.   He turns around and sees
     them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't
     showing it. Danny approaches him. This exchange is whispered
     with a great amount of drama at very close range.

                         DINNER JACKET
               Can I help you?

                         DANNY
               Yeah. What the hell are you doing?

                         DINNER JACKET
               I am getting here first.

     Just then, Frank and Yen arrive.    The Frenchman looks them
     over.

                         RUSTY
               This is our score.

                         DINNER JACKET
               I am here before you.

                         FRANK
                   (joining)
               We let you in the house! Somehow
               you got in after we hit the code
               but before we got to the door.

                         DINNER JACKET
               That's thirty seconds. How could I
               know which exact thirty seconds I
               had? Unless I knew you plan. Could
               I have known your plan? Do you have
               a snitch in your group?

                           DANNY
               No.

                           RUSTY
               We don't.

               Yes, I know you don't. Because I
               saw, the whole thing from that
               chair. I knew you were around,
               but I had my own plan.

     Yen says something in Chinese.

                         DINNER JACKET
               There's really no need for that.

     Danny wants to raise his voice, but he can't.   Vanderspeigle
     is snoring twenty feet away.

                         DANNY
               Listen, we have to come to some
               arrangement.

                         LINUS
               We've incurred some very serious
               costs here.

     Danny and Rusty look at him.

                         LINUS
               Well, we have.

     The Malloys arrive.

                         DINNER JACKET
               Every second I am becoming more
               outnumbered.

                         VIRGIL
                   (whispering, re: Dinner
                    Jacket)
               Who's this?

                         FRANK
               He said he got here first.

                         VIRGIL
               That's bullshit.

                         RUSTY
               Hey. Mouth.

                         VIRGIL
               This is our goddamned job!

     He sounds as angry as a guy who's whispering can sound.

                         LIVINGSTON
               If the situation were reversed--

                         DINNER JACKET
               But the situation is not reversed.
               The situation is that I am here
               first, without any help from you.

     Livingston arrives, soaking wet like everyone else.

                         DINNER JACKET
               So as much as I would--

     Basher and Saul arrive.

                         DINNER JACKET
               Jesus, how many of you are there?

                         DANNY
               Just give us the stock certificate.
               Whatever else you took out of that
               safe...it's yours.

     Dinner Jacket stops.   Thinks for a moment.   Then:

                          DINNER JACKET
               No. But: I leave you with
               something.

     He hands Danny a business card.

                         DINNER JACKET
               My attorney. In case Evelyn's
               employer tries anything...well,
               anything.

     Dinner Jacket smiles, then pulls a tiny electronic device out
     of his shirt pocket. He presses a button.

     And the alarm blares to life.


80   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                              80

     Paul stares at Isabel.

                         PAUL
               Are you sure?

                         ISABEL
               I'm sure there's another scenario
               that would fit these physical
               details, but I don't know what it
               is.

                         PAUL
               Where should we start?

     Isabel takes out her PDA, writes something on her keypad, and
     hits a few buttons. A second later, Paul's BEEPER goes off.

               You can start by picking that guy
               up.


81   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                       81

     The group sits around looking depressed.

                         VIRGIL
               Who the hell was that guy?

                         FRANK
               It's going to get out, you know.
               People are going to find out.

                         BASHER
               Somebody must know this bloke's
               name.

                         LIVINGSTON
               The question is who trained him. He
               got into that place alone.

                          DANNY
               He says.

                         FRANK
               I believed him.

                         SAUL
                   (unsettled)
               You think he's better than us?

                         FRANK
               I'm not saying anything, but the
               man was sitting there, waiting for
               us.

                         LINUS
               Do you think the cops even know who
               this guys is?

                         RUSTY
               Please. That guy's never even seen
               a cop.

                         TURK
               Maybe he works with the cops.

               You don't work with the cops unless
               you absolutely have to. And not
               even then.

                         BASHER
               Either way, he's got to have a name.

                         LIVINGSTON
               It can't be that hard to find out
               who this guy is. Like I said,
               somebody trained him. Who trains
               the best?

                         DANNY
               LeMarc.
                   (to Rusty)
               Right?

                         RUSTY
               If he's not dead.

                         LINUS
               Who's LeMarc?

     Stunned silence from the guys. They won't even respond.

     Yen says something.

     Isabel arrives.

     Isabel is waiting to be processed. Eventually, she is
     directed down a hallway.


84   INT. INTERROGATION ANTEROOM -- DAY                        84

     We LOOK through a one-way mirror into the interrogation room
     where detectives Onderdonk and Devenpeck are trying the bad
     cop / bad cop routine on Evelyn.

     Isabel walks INTO FRAME and watches: Onderdonk slams his fist
     on the table. Davenpeck shouts in Evelyn's face. Evelyn
     just laughs.

     Isabel shakes her head.

     Frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee, the two
     detectives leave the interrogation room for the ante-room
     where Isabel is.

                         ONDERDONK
               Fucking stone.

                         DAVENPECK
               I'm not quitting.

                         ONDERDONK
               Who said quitting. I'm tired.

                         ISABEL
               Can I speak to him?

     The two detectives look at each other.

                         DAVENPECK
               Who are you?

     Isabel produces a signed document. They look at it, shrug,
     and give it back.

                         DAVENPECK
               Apparently, you can do whatever you
               want with him.

                         ONDERDONK
               Are you moving him?

                         ISABEL
               Oh no. I just need to speak with
               him. To get some information.

                         DAVENPECK
               We've been on him for six hours.

                         ONDERDONK
               With our best stuff.

                         DAVENPECK
               Our best stuff. In mind terms,
               we've been torturing this guy.

                         ISABEL
               I'm sure. I only need a moment,
               then I'll be out of your way.

     They shrug. Isabel goes into the room with Evelyn. We STAY
     WITH Onderdonk and Davenpeck, who watch her through the two-
     way mirror.

     THROUGH THE MIRROR: Isabel walks right up to Evelyn, smiles,
     and whispers one word to him/her.

     Evelyn's face freezes. He/she looks at Isabel, scared. Then
     he/she starts to weep. Uncontrollably.... Tears stream down
     his/her face.

     Isabel hands Evelyn a sheet of paper and he/she begins to
     write.

     Onderdonk and Davenpeck are dumbfounded.     Isabel turns
     around so she's facing them.


85   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                          85

     The entire group, minus Danny, sits around glumly watching
     CNN International on the flat screen.

     Danny is on his cell phone on the other side of the room.

                         DANNY (INTO PHONE)
               It's not a problem, it's a hiccup.
               It won't affect our schedule that
               much. I want to talk about you, not
               the job. How are you doing?

     KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. Something about it doesn't sound familiar.
     Danny moves into the big roam.

     Rusty is at the door, looking through the peep-hole. Rusty
     puts his head down. Clearly it isn't a stranger.

                         DANNY
               Tess, I've got to call you back.

     He hangs up. KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. Rusty indicates for Danny to
     get it.

                         DANNY
               Coming.

     Danny opens the door to reveal ISABEL. She looks at Danny.
     He looks back at her. They don't say a word. Danny motions
     for her to come in.

               Is it? Because you've been seeing a
               lot of me lately.

     She hands a surveillance photo to Rusty.

               You were sitting in a Mercedes
               outside my apartment on Wednesday
               night.

     She hands Rusty another photo. (These are the photos Hess the
     male secretary showed her at Europol HQ that we couldn't
     see.)

               You were hiding in the bushes when
               I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria
               Bella.

     She hands him a third photo.   Looks at the fourth.

                         ISABEL
               This one...I'm not even sure where
               this one was taken, but I like it a
               lot. Very Ron Gallela.

     She hands this photo to Danny. It's a picture of Rusty, with
     a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailbox
     he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel.

                         ISABEL
               I mean, if I didn't know better I'd
               think you all came here to steal
               the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift,
               also known as the world's first
               stock certificate.
                   (to the group as a whole)
               You must have been so proud of
               yourselves. A Schuman Special. It's
               been awhile.
                   (smiles at Basher)
               That was a very handsome crossbow
               shot, Eugene.

     Basher winces at the sound of his real name. The group
     stares back at her. Can't believe this is happening.

                         ISABEL
               And the Palowski...whose idea was that?

     She knows it was Rusty.

                         RUSTY
               We didn't steal anything.

                         ISABEL
               Oh...I know you didn't. Somebody
               beat you to it. One man. No crew.
               No back up. Tell me something --
               just so I can get the full picture
               in my head -- was he wearing a
               tuxedo? A white dinner jacket?

                   (to Isabel)
               At least we saw him in the flesh.
               You'll never see this guy your
               whole life.

                         ISABEL
               So you know who he is?

                         DANNY
               Of course we know who he is.

                         ISABEL
               Well, then. I'll see you when you
               see him. To get your certificate
               back.

     from Danny's hand.

     She walks out. The group is frozen. Livingston is still

               This is what I was talking about.

               She could reduce her stress by

               Some say he's one of these guys
               that thinks because he was born in
               a penthouse, he controls the
               elevator business. Others say he
               turned out okay when you consider
               how rich his parents were.

               Taxes over here are brutal. People

               cellphone market on the ground

               as a child. He's a public figure,
               people know who he is. He's been

               You know what? I don't like that

                He's an avid golfer, pro-level
                tennis player, and inveterate
                gambler. But apparently his

                          LINUS
                He's rarely alone. I think it's a
                compulsion. I have a list of names
                here...it was just the first week.

                          DANNY
                All right, moving on, is there
                anything else we need to know about
                this guy before we--

                          BASHER
                Did we forget to mention he's a
                Viscount?

                            DANNY
                A what?

                            LIVINGSTON
                Viscount.    As in nobility.

                    (cannot take it anymore)
                Last time I checked titles like
                that went out with a little number
                I like to call the French
                Revolution--

                             BASHER
                Spain.

                             DANNY
                What?

                             BASHER
                His title.     It's Spanish.   Mother's
                cousin.


102   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S BEDROOM -- DAWN                  102

      Toulour crawls out of bad. Wonders who the woman next to him
      is.


103   BACK TO SCENE -- INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAY          103

                          DANNY
                He may be the greatest thief in
                Europe. He may have slept with
                half of the EU. He may be a
                Casanova with the soul of a
                starving artist. It doesn't matter.


104   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S HALLWAY -- DAWN                  104

      Toulour comes downstairs in his bathrobe.


105   BACK TO SCENE -- INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN         105

                          DANNY
                There's something he cares about.
                There's something he can't live
                without.

106   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S HOUSE -- DAWN                    106

      Toulour reaches the base of the stairs and stops dead in his
      tracks. He looks ahead of him to a wall covered with
      paintings. One painting is clearly missing.



                                                           (CONTINUED)

106   CONTINUED:                                                  106

      All that remains are the dust/fade marks on the wall to
      indicate that it had been there.

      He walks up to the wall and smiles -- certainly this will be
      an interesting day. He's actually been cheered up by this.

107   EXT. TOULOUR'S VILLA -- DAY                                 107

      Toulour in playing a hard-fought game of tennis. His
      opponent (EDMUND) bangs a great shot. Toulour gets there and
      smacks it back. Edmund dives for the ball, just gets it back
      over the net. But Toulour is waiting and hits a kill shot.

                          EDMUNDS
                Are you on steroids?

      Toulour laughs.

                           EDMUND
                Let's try again. Give me five games
                this time.

                          TOULOUR
                You are worse than Sampras. You
                should be paying me.

      A BUTLER arrives.

                          BUTLER
                    (in French)
                Pardon me, sir.

      He hands Toulour two business cards.   One says "Daniel
      Ocean," the other "Rusty Ryan."

                          BUTLER
                    (in French)
                Two gentlemen. They say they met
                you in Amsterdam last week.

                          TOULOUR
                    (in French)
                Put them on the veranda and get
                them a drink. I'll be right up.


108   EXT. VERANDA -- DAY                                         108

      Danny and Rusty look out over Lake Como. Toulour arrives.

                          DANNY
                Other way around.

                          TOULOUR
                Are you sure? Usually I'm so good
                at that.

      Edmund arrives, carrying his tennis bag.

                          TOULOUR
                This is Edmund. Edmund.      Rusty.
                Danny.

      He calls by their wrong names again.

                          DANNY
                Nice to meet you. Edmund.
                    (making conversation)
                You a tennis pro?

      Rusty takes a sip of ice tea.

                          EDMUND
                Actually, no, I'm the King of
                Morocco.

      Danny and Rusty nod, their smiles frozen.


109   INT. VILLA -- DAY                                      109

      Toulour shows Danny and Rusty his art.

                          TOULOUR
                Sadly, I can't show you my favorite
                painting of all -- a Degas that
                used to hang right there -- because
                it was stolen recently.

                          DANNY
                That's awful.

                          RUSTY
                The criminal element is everywhere
                these days.

      Toulour nods.

                          DANNY
                Listen, Francois--


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                          TOULOUR
                Please. Call me Baron.

                          DANNY
                We came here for the Vanderspeigle
                certificate--

                          TOULOUR
                That's not for sale.

                          DANNY
                Your Degas is worth three times
                that. You want your painting back,
                you're going to have to trade.

                          TOULOUR
                You actually expect me to believe
                that you are in possession of my
                Degas? You are living in a...in a
                bubble.

      Toulour looks at them and walks away.

                                                           CUT TO:


110   INT. LAKE COMO HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                          110

      Rusty and Danny stand with the rest of the group.

                          BASHER
                He used the word "amateur"?

      Rusty and Danny nod reluctantly.

                          VIRGIL
                You said we could show him the
                painting right, to prove that we
                had it.

                            DANNY
                Yes.

                          RUSTY
                He still wouldn't trade.

      Yen says something.

                          FRANK
                We need to teach him a lesson.

                          TURK
                Absolutely.

                          DANNY
                All right, let's stay calm.
                We don't need to over-react here.
                He said some disrespectful things,
                that's true. But why antagonize
                this guy? Why get into something
                with him? He's young and he's
                filthy rich, and he's got time on
                his hands. We don't want to become
                his Betty noir. We can just fence
                his painting and earn a lot more
                than we would have from the
                certificate.

                          BASHER
                It's about reputation. You said so
                yourself. We have to get that
                certificate to Evelyn's buyer or--

                          DANNY
                We'll make enough selling the Degas
                to pay off her buyer--

                           FRANK
                Then why did you make that trip
                down there in the first place, if
                you didn't want to get into
                something?

                          DANNY
                Saul?

                          SAUL
                Turn his name over to Isabel. In
                exchange for getting off our backs.

      Tough one to swallow.

                          SAUL
                Short of that...the only
                appropriate response is to steal
                his next job right out from under
                him. Just like he did to us.

                          TURK
                We don't even know our next job.

                          DANNY
                We got ten million in that closet.

                          DANNY
                I cash in the Degas, take a moment
                to think about our next move.
                Toulour isn't going anywhere. You
                guys are hyping him too much,
                you're letting him get inside your
                head.

      Everyone agrees.

      Danny opens the closet.

      There's a picture frame in there, but NO PICTURE. It's been
      stolen by Toulour.

      We hear the SOUND OF A CASE BEING SHUT AND LOCKED.


111   INT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                                  111

      We see a SMALL, SECURE BOX being transported to a heavily
      secured truck.


112   EXT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                                  112

      The truck exits the building and drives down a street with
      security MOTORCYCLES surrounding it.


113   EXT. PARIS FREEWAY -- DAY                                   113

      The motorcade heads for the private airport.

      The secure box is loaded onto a plane as Isabel and her male
      secretary Hess exit a plane nearby.

                Why do I need to see all these
                guys? When I tracked the Munch
                down in Sweden I got all the
                approvals I needed with one phone
                call.

                 With Lenin's shaving kit the
                 Russians brought me in and it took
                 a single signature and I got it at
                 the airport a minute after I
                 arrived. What's so goddamned
                 special about the French?

      Hess gives her a look as though she should know better.

                          HESS
                Without their signatures, you can't
                do anything. You can't pull the
                suspects over, you can't do
                surveillance on them, you're not
                even allowed to contact them.
                They're real sticklers about
                sovereignty issues here.

      The Bureaucrat looks at Isabel. All of her.

                          INSPECTOR
                Isabel, I couldn't possibly sign
                those documents in good conscience
                without talking to you about the
                case in detail. I realize you're in
                a hurry and my schedule for the
                rest of the day is quite full, so
                perhaps, if you're interested in
                being expedient, we could discuss
                the case...over dinner.

                Don't stop for that.

      The driver accelerates through a yellow/red light, almost
      hitting DANNY AND TOULOUR

      Who deftly avoid getting crushed.

                          DANNY
                That's not how I want to go.

                          TOULOUR
                No.

      They walk on.

                          TOULOUR
                Very theatrical of you...asking to
                meet here. Like we're spies
                meeting to do an exchange.

                          DANNY
                Why are you doing this to us?

                          TOULOUR
                Doing what?

                          DANNY
                This is a game for you. For us it's
                survival. Are you that bored? I
                mean...

                          TOULOUR
                No. I wouldn't do that. No... The
                truth is...I made a bet. Or maybe a
                better word is a "wager".

                          DANNY
                What kind of wager?


118   EXT. PARIS CAPE -- DAY                                   118

      Danny and Toulour sit across from each other.   The bottom
      quarter of the Eifel tower is visible in the background.

                           TOULOUR
                A gentlemen's wager with a friend
                of mine -- my mentor. A few months
                ago we were at his winter place in
                Nicaragua and another guest
                referred to me as "the greatest
                thief in the world." I didn't
                object, obviously, but my mentor
                fell silent. Later I asked him
                about it. He said if I really
                wanted to say I was the best
                thief...I'd have to prove I was
                better than the eleven of you.

                 You know, the Benedict job made
                 waves, even all the way over here.
                 16.3 million dollars. That's a lot
                 of money.

                          DANNY
                163.

                          TOULOUR
                Sorry. 163. Before you were found.


119   INT. ARAB MUSEUM ROOFTOP FUNCTION ROOM -- DAY            119

                          TOULOUR
                Yes, 163 million is a lot of money.
                It attracts attention. So, in a
                way, you brought this problem with
                me on yourselves. You're victims
                of your own success.

                          DANNY
                Here's what I'm going to do. You
                tell me the name of your mentor.
                I'll call him up and I'll tell him
                that you're the greatest thief in
                the world...that I accept that to
                be true.... And in return...you
                leave us alone, let us go about our
                business. How about that?

                          TOULOUR
                He said you'd probably say
                something like that -- but he said
                you'd probably have your fingers
                crossed when you said it.

      Danny frowns, pulls his hand out of his pocket.

                          TOULOUR (CONT'D)
                So in this situation -- for the
                purposes of my wager -- words
                aren't good enough. I have to
                prove this on the ground.

                          DANNY
                This mentor of yours...was he a
                good thief in his day?

                          TOULOUR
                Who, LeMarc?

           Yeah. Him.

                Who?

      Yen says something.

                          RUSTY
                I thought so too.

                             SAUL
                LeMarc.     The LeMarc.

      Danny nods.

                          SAUL
                God hates me. He hates all of us.

                          FRANK
                Hell, this could go on forever.

                          DANNY
                No. It's going to be settled by one
                more job. A single object.

                          SAUL
                Whatever it is, let's just let him
                have it.

                             DANNY
                We can't.

                          LIVINGSTON
                Because of pride?

                          DANNY
                Because we beat him, he'll pay
                Benedict off.

      A stunned beat.

                One score, for the whole thing?

                          LIVINGSTON
                What do we have to do? I mean, is
                it a fair bet or is it like...the
                Coronation Egg or something?

      Danny points.   That's it.   That's the one.

                          SAUL
                He wants us to steal the Coronation
                Egg!

                          BASHER
                That's just... that's...what is
                that?

                          SAUL
                The Holy Grail.

                          RUSTY
                Carl Faberge, the greatest
                goldsmith in history, constructed
                the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the
                wedding of Czar Nicholas and
                Alexandra. Every world class thief
                in the last 108 years has tried to
                steal it. No one has even come
                close.

                          SAUL
                That's because it's cursed.

                           LINUS
                What?

                          SAUL
                It's un-stealable.

                          DANNY
                It's the only thing in LeMarc's
                entire career that he went after
                but failed to get. He tried three
                times.

      A long beat of silence....

                          DANNY
                We get the egg and we're free.

                  I'm going to need surveillance on

                  If I had to guess I'd say I'll need
                  at least 25 people, a dozen

                  Okay, one more thing, and this is
                  crucial: these guys are extremely,
                  sophisticated at avoiding
                  electronic surveillance, so we'll
                  need real state of the art stuff.

      complex double-locking mechanism that would make it

      Basher is being questioned by Danny.

                          BASHER
                Not since we first got here. About
                an hour ago.

      Danny moves away.

                          BASHER (cont'd)
                    (to Danny's back)
                And where's Saul and Linus?


127   INT. ROME HOTEL ROOM -- DAY                                 127

      Isabel enters her room. Suddenly she spins and draws her
      pistol.   Her gun ends up in Rusty's face.

                          ISABEL
                Jesus, Robert. I could've killed
                you.

      He shrugs. A long beat as she takes a look at him.

                             RUSTY
                I'm older.

                          ISABEL
                I hope so. What are you doing in my
                room?

                          RUSTY
                I thought maybe we could get some
                coffee.

                          ISABEL
                No, thanks.

                          RUSTY
                Okay, how about a two week trip to
                Zanzibar?

                          ISABEL
                Please don't.

                Fine, coffee then. Whatever you
                say.

      Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.

                          ISABEL
                Why do I want to have coffee with
                you?

                          RUSTY
                How should I know? sorry about your
                mom.

      Isable nods.

                          RUSTY (cont'd)
                She was a real...

                          ISABEL
                She hated you.

                          RUSTY
                Well, she was nice enough to hide
                it from me. Some people can't even
                do that.

                          ISABEL
                She hated everybody.

      Rusty nods.    He remembers.

                          ISABEL
                You'll never get it by the way.

                            RUSTY
                Get what?

                          ISABEL
                You'll think you've got it, you'll
                be so close that you'll be able to
                taste it and then this guy, the
                Night Fox or whoever he is, will
                just take it -- right out of your
                hand -- just like he did in
                Amsterdam. He's as good as LeMarc.

                          RUSTY
                It's not possible.

                          ISABEL
                You're in a bubble.

      A mock up of the room the egg will be displayed in. A dummy
      egg sits on a cradle in the center of the room. Infra-red
      motion detectors cover the room. Motion sensitive lasers
      shine directly onto the egg.

      Danny, Basher, Yen, Frank, and Livingston try to figure out
      how to get around the security systems.

                           LIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND)
                 No, that won't work either. The IR
                 will pick it up before you even get
                 close.

      This is depressing to everyone.

                           FRANK
                 Look, if we're having this much
                 trouble, and we've got ten guys
                 Toulour must be pulling his hair
                 out.


129   INTERCUT -- EXT. POOLSIDE -- DAY                         129

      Toulour lies in a lounge chair.


130   BACK TO SCENE -- INT. ROME WAREHOUSE -- DAY              130

      The group agrees Toulour must be suffering like them.

      Rusty strides in. Everyone looks at him. He looks at the mock
      up of the egg.

                           RUSTY
                 Would you call that bubble-shaped?

                             DANNY
                 What?

      Rusty shrugs it off.

                           RUSTY
                 She pulled a gun on me.

      He sits.

                          DANNY
                More importantly, what kind of
                reception is the Italian Police
                giving her?


131   INT. ROME POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- DAY                        131

      A SUBORDINATE OFFICER leads Isabel down a hallway.

                          SUBORDINATE OFFICER
                Captain Giordano is handling an
                urgent interrogation. He'll be up
                as soon as it is completed. Please
                wait in here.

      He leads Isabel and Hess into the Captain's office.    A large
      clock on the wall reads 11:45 am.

      The open windows in the office look out onto one of Rome's
      famous courtyards. Captain Giordano stands with three other
      officers. They are having a loud, tense conversation in
      Italian.

      Isabel watches as Giordano's temper really flares.    He jabs
      his finger at one of the other cops.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED)
                Naples sucks! They're a joke! The
                only decent player they have is
                Pasqualli -- and he's a pussy.
                          ITALIAN COP 1 (SUBTITLED)
                Pasqualli runs circles around
                Bologna's backfield every time.
                          ITALIAN COP 2 (SUBTITLED)
                Pasqualli could single-handedly--
      Isabel turns to the officer who escorted her in.

                          ISABEL
                What are they talking about?

      Isabel's sitting on the couch now, her eye lids drooping.

      Hess checks his PDA.

      and a half hours.


134   INT. ROME WAREHOUSE -- DAY                                  134

      Livingston, Yen, Danny, and Rusty are experimenting with a
      way for Yen to drop from the ceiling so that he's hanging
      right over the egg.

      Their mock-up alarm rings.    A red light flashes.

                             LIVINGSTON
                Damn-it.

      Danny rubs his face. This is feeling impossible.      He goes
      into the corner and clicks a walkie-talkie.

      in the background we see Rusty trying to keep everybody's
      spirits high.

                          RUSTY
                All right, okay. Let's not be
                defeatists.... What about that

      Saul and Linus enter.

      Linus puts his BACKPACK down.

      Isabel is asleep on the couch. It's 5:30 PM. A hand taps
      her shoulder. She wakes up and is shocked to see Captain
      Giordano, finally, standing above her.

136   MOMENTS LATER                                               136

      Isabel and the Captain are alone now. Giordano is looking
      right into her eyes, with laser focus. There isn't even a
      hint of lasciviousness about him. He's all business.

                          ISABEL
                ...reason to believe these men...

                Coronation Egg when it is actually
                put on display next week. I need

                          ISABEL
                And I'll need substantial resources
                from your department. Can I count

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO

      Isabel stops.   Starts to wonder.

                          ISABEL
                So, Captain, what do you think of
                my skirt?

      He smiles and looks at her.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                I think it's very beautiful. Why,
                don't you like it?

                I don't usually call for a second
                date. For you I make an exception.

                Thanks.

                          TOULOUR
                I think it's good that we talk. You
                see, you should stop following me.
                You're wasting your time. I'm going
                to let you go first and get caught.
                Then they will increase the
                security even more, and then I will
                steal the Egg. Then Lemarc can make
                his decision.

                          DANNY
                You sound confident.

                          TOULOUR
                Confident? This is a very American
                word. I am arrogant. There's a
                difference.

                          DANNY
                Doesn't matter if you're that good.
                Are you that good?

                I can move objects with my mind.

      Danny just looks at him.

                          TOULOUR
                You don't believe it?

                          DANNY
                Do you?

                          TOULOUR
                Are you done stirring your sugar?

      Danny stops, lifts the spoon. It's completely BENT.

                          DANNY
                That's fantastic.
                    (starts to go)
                Listen, I appreciate the call, and,
                best of luck.

                Danny. I'm serious. Sit down,

      Danny site down and looks at him.

                          DANNY
                You're telekinetic, is that what
                you're telling me?

                          TOULOUR
                Yes. But...it's a curse. A
                nightmare. Everything is too easy.
                But then LeMarc says I'm still not
                the best. So I take his challenge.
                And you will fail, and I will win,
                and so what? What does it prove?
                What is he trying to show me?

      Danny just looks at him.


138   INT. CAPTAIN GIORDANO'S OFFICE -- DAY                     138

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                Ms. Lahiri, you're in Italy now.
                We are a sovereign nation. We're
                not some adjunct, some
                administrative district of the EU.
                When Europol calls we don't jump up
                and tap dance for you. If you want
                to work in Italy, then you have to
                do it under Italian authority...and
                that means you have to talk to
                Commander Andriotti...who, I'm
                sure, will be happy to meet with
                you some time next week--

                             ISABEL
                Next week!

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                --when he returns from vacation.

      Isabel slumps back into her chair.   Stares up to the heavens.

                We both did. I'm exhausted.


140   EXT. CAFE JUST OFF PIAZZA NAVONA -- DAY                   140

      An exasperated Isabel tries to regain her equilibrium with a
      cappuccino. A piece of music comes over the cafe loudspeaker
      that catches Isabel's attention. A CHEESY WAVY SCREEN
      TRANSITION TO:


141   ISABEL'S FLASHBACK                                        141

      Years ago. Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading
      the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles. She
      looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore.
      As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty. Eight cops are
      chasing him.
      Rusty rushes past the cafe. As he does he notices Isabel,
      they make eye contact. Then he's gone. Sprints around the
      corner. The cops rush past her. She hears sirens converging
      from all directions.

142   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS (STILL IN FLASHBACK)             142

      Isabel shows her Europol identification to a detective.
                          ISABEL
                Hi, this isn't official business.
                Actually, I'm here on vacation. But
                I was sitting in a cafe this
                afternoon, near the Piazza Navona
                and...the police were chasing
                someone on foot. I was just
                wondering if you caught him or...do
                you know anything about that case?

                I know the case, yes.
                Unfortunately, we didn't catch him.
                           ISABEL
                Oh...

143   EXT. CAFE JUST OFF PIAZZA NAVONA - DAY (STILL FLASHBACK)     143

      Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the
      newspaper, enjoying her vacation. She looks up and stops
      cold.
      Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored
      suit, sits down three tables away from her.
      She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The
      audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in
      the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian.
      Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.   She gets up and
      walks over to Rusty's table.
                          ISABEL
                Excuse me...
                           RUSTY
                Yes.
                          ISABEL
                Um...Did I...? I think I saw
                you...yesterday.
                           RUSTY
                Oh yeah?
                          ISABEL
                The police were chasing you.
                          RUSTY
                You sure your eyes aren't broken?
                          ISABEL
                I'm quite sure it was you.
                          RUSTY
                Well, then I'm not gonna argue. Can
                I buy you a coffee?

                                                                 93.



144   EXT. CAFE JUST OFF PIAZZA NAVOLA -- DAY                   144

      We transition back to the cafe. Isabel's phone rings.

                             ISABEL
                Hello.

                          RUSTY
                We've got to stop meeting like
                this.

      She turns. He's sitting at the table behind her.


145   EXT. CAFE JUST OFF PIAZZA NAVOLA -- DAY - LATER           145

      Isabel and Rusty are being quiet for the moment.

      The waiter's in the midst of an animated discussion in
      Italian with one of the customers.

                          ISABEL
                What are they talking about all the
                time?!

                           RUSTY
                Soccer.
                    (translating)
                He doesn't like Naples....thinks
                they're a bunch of...sissies.
                    (turns to Isabel)
                Can I ask you a question?
                    (off Isabel's nod)
                Will you come to Zanzibar with me
                on Friday?

                             ISABEL
                Stop it.

      TIGHT MEDIUM shot on uniformed National Police officer as he
      strides down the hallway. His bearing is disciplined, stern,
      formal. He is clearly handling a matter of utmost
      importance. Tilt down to reveal he is carrying a tiny cup of
      CAPPUCCINO.

      Isabel sits with Commander Andriotti. The office door swings
      open and the National Police officer walks in. He places the
      cappuccino on Andriotti's desk and leaves.


150   INT. CAPTAIN GIORDANO'S OFFICE -- DAY                      150

      Giordano sits with his feet up on his desk, smoking a cigar.

      The door swings open and Isabel strides in, catching him
      completely off guard. She thrusts a piece of paper in his
      face.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                What's that?

                          ISABEL
                An order signed by Commander
                Andriotti instructing you to
                "provide any and all support that
                Agent Lahiri requests, whenever she
                requests it."

      He looks at it.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                It's good, yes. Okay.

      He looks at her.

                That's a very nice blouse you wear
                today.

                When Dominique goes back with
                Thomas to check the trunk, the
                money shouldn't be in the
                briefcase. Franklin should have
                double-crossed them.

                That could be a great moment, when
                he's on the ground.

                          TURK
                And you think Thomas is going to
                get blown up.

                            VIRGIL
                Hey.

      They look. A large group of Security people are talking to
      some NEW TECHNICIANS and ISABEL.

                          ISABEL
                Another camera here and here. And
                have a guard here at all times so
                any attempt to disable the system
                will be detected. All your IR
                devices need to be fitted with

                She just walked in there like
                Patton or something. She's
                changing...everything and-- There
                were so many cops with her. I've
                never seen so--

      Danny plats up his hand to stop him.

                I don't understand. If her father
                was a thief...why's she such a
                hardass? I mean you'd think she'd
                have a little sympathy for us.

                           RUSTY
                When she was twelve her mother told
                her that her dad got arrested doing
                a job in Russia and died in jail.
                    (beat)
                So I wouldn't count on much

      the museum chatting with Captain Giordano, who's clearly
      brown-nosing her big-time since receiving Andriotti's order.

      Her phone rings. She looks at the number and answers it.

                If he gets it, we'll let you arrest
                us. If we get it, you come away
                with me to Zanzibar--

                security at the museum, unless you
                are someone he knows and trusts
                enough to leave alone in the
                gallery, after disabling about half
                of their security system, forget
                it. We are not stealing that
                egg...

                          DANNY
                "Someone he knows. Someone he
                trusts...." "Someone he knows...."

                          RUSTY
                What about someone he doesn't know
                but trusts?

                          DANNY
                For instance?

                          RUSTY
                I'm talking about you know who, who
                looks an awful lot like you know
                who...

      Everyone looks at Danny.

                          DANNY
                She might. It's not going to be
                easy getting her over here.


157   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 157

      Tess walks down the street. She passes an alley, where a
      utilities truck is raising a MAN IN A BUCKET.

      She enters the department store.


158   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 158

      Tess shops for perfume.   The Power twins watch her from a
      discreet distance.

      She smiles at them.   Then makes her way to the ladies room.


159   INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY                                      159

      She walks in and goes right for the window. She's about to
      open it when it opens from outside. She jumps a mile until
      she sees that BRUISER is there, standing in the bucket from
      the utilities company.

                          BRUISER
                Hiya, Tess. Just climb on through.
                Try not to look down too much.


160   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 160

      Four stories above an alleyway. Tess climbs out the ladies
      room window into the cherry picker basket, with Bruiser's
      help.


161   EXT. STREET LEVEL -- A MINUTE LATER                          161

      Tess climbs into a taxi cab. Reuben -- in an anachronistic
      taxi driver's uniform -- is driving.

                          REUBEN
                There's make-up in the bag there.
                And some photos. Do the best you
                can.

                                                                 99.



162   INT. THE POSHEST ROME HOTEL -- DAY                        162

      The HOTEL MANAGER comes to the front desk to answer a call.

                          HOTEL MANAGER
                Bonjourno. Yes. Yes. Oh...oh,
                really. Well, absolutely. We can
                have...I can make our presidential
                suite available. No, no, no. No
                trouble at all. We'd love... We're
                honored that she'd think of us...

      He hangs up.   Turns, elated, to his front desk staff.

                          HOTEL MANAGER (SUBTITLED)
                Julia Roberts is coming to stay with
                us!

163   EXT. POSHEST ROME HOTEL -- DAY                            163

      Tess, as Julia Roberts, steps out of a Mercedes limo wearing
      sunglasses and carrying a puppy. Frank and Basher, as Nation
      of Islam bodyguards, clear a place in front of her. Reuben
      trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes.

      A throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her. Strobes
      blind us. Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at
      her for autographs. It's a frigging madhouse.

                          PRESS
                Ms. Roberts! Ms. Roberts! Why did
                you come back to Rome so soon!!

                Ms. Roberts is very tired!! Please

164   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE -- DAY                                   164

      Tess enters and shuts the door behind her.  She takes a deep
      breath and exhales. She looks up at Danny, who's there
      waiting for her.

                          TESS
                I can't do this.

      Danny goes to her.    Kisses her.   Hugs her.    When he steps
      back he answers:

                          DANNY
                Yes, you can.

                          TESS
                I'm not an actress, Danny!     And I
                don't look like her!

                           DANNY
                You do, Tess. You really do. I
                never told you that before, but
                it's true.

                          TESS

      She notions at her body, but we can't tell what part.

                            TESS
                And my...

      She motions at her body again; again it's totally ambiguous
      what part.

                And my ears. Anybody who sees my
                ears is going to know instantly.

                          DANNY
                Nobody's looking at your ears.

                          TESS
                Yes, Danny, they are.     They're
                going to know.


165   INT. DISPLAY ROOM FOR EGG -- MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAY   165

      Isabel stands with the MUSEUM DIRECTOR.

                          ISABEL
                When did that happen?

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR
                We just found out. I arranged a
                private showing for tomorrow
                morning before we open the show to
                the public.

                          ISABEL
                I don't understand, why do you have
                to disable any of the systems--

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR
                Because she might want to get close
                to the egg, got right up here and
                look at it. And I'm not going to
                embarrass myself or this
                institution by telling her she
                can't.

                          ISABEL
                She's an actress, Giovanni, not the
                Pope.

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR
                Do you realize how much free
                publicity we'll get for this
                museum, just because she because
                she decided to come by and look at
                the egg? She's even agreed to do a
                photo shoot for us promoting the
                museum.

      Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.

                That's exactly the sort of thing...


166   INTERCUT -- INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY                           166

      Saul, Frank, and Rusty sit on plush couches and watch
      Isabel's conversation with the museum director from six
      different angles. Clearly, Livingston has tapped into the
      museum's closed circuit system.

                          ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.)
                ...that the people I'm after will
                exploit.
                    (thinks)
                Okay, fine. You want to shut down
                half the electronic system, let me
                post eight cops in the room...

      Saul, Frank, and Rusty clench teeth and fists... On pins and
      needles for a moment. If the museum director agrees they're
      in big trouble.

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.)
                Are you crazy? That's worse
                than....you want me to treat her
                like a criminal?

      The guys relax back into the couches, their plan narrowly
      having escaped disaster.


167   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               167

      On Saul, Frank, and Rusty relaxing. Only this angle has a
      digital quality to it -- because we are watching them now
      through a hi-def TV screen.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL Toulour, sitting in a warehouse of his
      own, watching his own surveillance footage of both our guys'
      warehouse and the museum's closed circuit system.

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.)
                Look, if you need to do something
                to reinforce security during her
                visit, fine. But it's got to be
                out of sight. And it can't effect
                Julia in any way. Are we clear?

                                                                103.




168   INT. ROME BISTRO -- DAY                                   168

      Toulour eats with a beautiful woman.   Virgil sits six tables
      away, keeping an eye on him.

      Turk strolls in and sits with his brother.

                          TURK
                Where is he?

                          VIRGIL
                    (points at Toulour)
                There. I took a look at the
                interrogation scene.

                          TURK
                Why?

                          VIRGIL
                'Cause Linus said it was
                repetitive.

                          TURK
                It clarifies everything.

                          VIRGIL
                He said it's too on the nose.

                          TURK
                What's he, the head of the studio?
                What's he ever written?

                          VIRGIL
                He's just saying -- Oh, no--

                          TURK
                What?

                          VIRGIL
                It's not him!

      Turk spine to see "Toulour" get up at the other table. Only
      it's not Toulour. It's somebody who looks like Toulour from
      behind.

                          TURK
                What! How did you-- You moron!
                You said you were watching him the
                whole time!

168   CONT1NUED:                                                168


                          VIRGIL
                I was! I mean, I used the bathroom
                once, but it was quick. You lost
                him yesterday!

      They sit for a minute.

                          TURK
                Livingston said Frank said that
                Rusty said that Danny said Toulour
                said don't ever bother following
                him.


169   INT. RUSTY'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                         169

      ON Rusty -- the blue light of an unseen television reflecting
      off his face. He walks onto the balcony.


170   WAVY TRANSITION TO FLASHBACK:                            170

      We follow Rusty down a hallway. He enters a dark apartment.
      Slips silently through the dining room. Two places are set.
      A candle on the table is burned down to almost nothing.

171   INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                    171

      The lights are out here too. But Isabel's still awake.
      Rusty enters the room. She doesn't look at him
                             RUSTY
                I'm sorry.
                          ISABEL
                What happened?
                          RUSTY
                I have to go. Right now. I have
                to leave the country. It could
                be a while. A month. Maybe more.
      Isabel turns to look at Rusty. She can barely see the
      outline of his face in the darkness.
                          ISABEL
                What are you saying? What the hell
                are you saying? Where are you
                going?

                          RUSTY
                I can't tell you.
      Isabel stares at his dark face.
                           ISABEL
                When people start talking the way
                you're talking there are only two
                possibilities: you're either in
                intelligence or you're a criminal.
                And no one I work with has ever
                worked with you...or even knows
                your name.
                          RUSTY
                You knew what I was the day you met
                me, Isabel.
                            ISABEL
                Robert...
                          RUSTY
                We can talk about it when I get
                back.
                           ISABEL
                No, Robert. I have to tell you
                something.
                          RUSTY
                What is it?
                           ISABEL
                I'm taking the job. I'm moving to
                Amsterdam.
      He doesn't respond for a moment.
                          RUSTY
                I can't have this conversation
                right now. Please, Isabel. I have
                to get out of here. I love you.
      He kisses her then leaves.

172   EXT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT                                 172

      Outside the front of the apartment, he shuts the door and
      turns toward us. We see his face in the light for the first
      time: His left eye is swollen shut. Blood is caked into his
      hair and on his cheek. Somebody beat the shit out of him.

                                                                  106.




173   BACK IN THE PRESENT DAY                                     173

      Rusty is still on the balcony.

      There's a knock at the door.   He opens it to see Isabel.

                          ISABEL
                You want to walk?


174   EXT. ROME -- NIGHT                                          174

      Rusty and Isabel sit on the steps of the Campidoglio.

                          ISABEL
                I know how you're planning to do
                it. I know Julia's visit is the
                key.

                          RUSTY
                Who's Julia?

                          ISABEL
                    (after a beat)
                LeMarc knew when to get out. He
                just quit...with his perfect record
                intact. Now he's a legend.
                    (exhorting)
                Don't do this.

                          RUSTY
                LeMarc quit because he was 75 years
                old, Isabel. He was tired. His
                doctor told him if he didn't start
                taking it easy he was going to have
                another heart attack. You're
                dramatizing it.

                          ISABEL
                You don't know why LeMarc retired,
                any better than I do. You have no
                idea.

                          RUSTY
                Actually, I do. I know exactly
                why.

                            ISABEL
                Really?    How's that?



                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                             107.
174   CONTINUED:                                              174


                          RUSTY
                He told me.

                          ISABEL
                    (skeptical as hell)
                You know LeMarc?

                            RUSTY
                A little.

                          ISABEL
                Since when?

                          RUSTY
                Ten years ago.

                          ISABEL
                For how long?

                          RUSTY
                For six months.

                            ISABEL
                You--

      She's so mad she can hardly speak.

                          ISABEL
                You knew LeMarc? You knew LeMarc
                and never told me? That's the worst
                thing you've ever done to me.
                Nobody knows more about LeMarc than
                me. How could you do that?

                          RUSTY
                I couldn't tell you, then.

                          ISABEL
                Really awful.

      Isabel thinks.

                          ISABEL
                Then why aren't you as good as
                Toulour?

      Rusty shrugs.

      A beat.

                          ISABEL
                I don't want to arrest you, Robert.
                I really don't. But I will if you
                make me. I will if you go for that
                egg.

      Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city.

                          ISABEL
                So many times, I waited. You can't
                do that to a person.

                           RUSTY
                Isabel--

                          ISABEL
                I have to go.

      Isabel gets up...walks away fast.    She's barely holding
      herself together.

      Rusty watches her go.   Several seconds, then:


175   FLASHBACK -- INT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- ROME -- DAY         175

      Rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the
      front door of his apartment with Isabel. It's a perfect
      sunny day outside.
      He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the
      apartment is bare. The furniture is still there. But
      nothing else. Nothing on the walls or the shelves.    Isabel
      has clearly moved out.
      Rusty's whole body reacts.... He slowly looks around him, as
      if in a dream. His eye goes to the dining room table.
      Isabel's engagement ring is there.

176   BACK TO SCENE -- EXT. ROME -- CAMPIDOGLIO -- NIGHT          176

      Rusty is still watching Isabel, small now in the distance.
      She turns the corner out of sight.


177   EXT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAWN                           177

      Isabel pulls up in her car.

                                                                 109.




178   INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAWN                          178

      The Egg is being put into position. Isabel watches.


179   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN                                   179

      Reuben is talking to Yen. Frank and Livingston get ready in
      the background.

                          REUBEN
                You're a photographer. Very
                exacting. You want things a certain
                way, but you never raise your
                voice. You're uncompromising.
                Strong.

                          FRANK
                Reuben, what are you doing?

                          REUBEN
                Oh, we understand each other. I'm
                mean, the actual words are
                gibberish to me, but I know what he
                means. There's a tone, you know. We
                communicate. I'm sure he'd tell you
                the same thing.
                    (to Yen)
                Am I right?

      Yen says something in Chinese.


180   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN                                   180

      Danny and the Malloys are looking at Tess's hair.

                          TURK
                I say we do a Joey Heatherton,
                1971.

                          VIRGIL
                It's the wrong color.

      Turk looks at his watch.

                          TURK
                Damn.

      There's a knock at the door. They let Tess check on it. She
      looks out the keyhole;

      It's TOPHER GRACE.

      Tess looks back to the group and shrugs.

                            TOPHER
                    (off)
                Hello?

      He knocks again.

      The group scrambles and hides. Tess opens the door.

                          TOPHER
                Hey! I got your room number from
                McCormick, I hope you don't mind.

      He walks in and hugs her. She looks terrified. Topher
      disengages and looks around.

                          TOPHER
                This is great. Do you have the
                adjoining room?

                            TESS
                Uh, no.

                          TOPHER
                Oh. Hey. I saw the rough cut of YOU
                ALWAYS, YOU NEVER. It's so awesome.
                Congratulations.

                          TESS
                Oh. Thank you.

                          TOPHER
                It was just like a dub of a lo-rez
                output, but I could totally see
                what you were doing. I think you
                might win again. Seriously.

                            TESS
                Oh.

                          TOPHER
                It really actually looked like you
                were blind. How did you do that?
                What is it like, an on-set thing,
                or was it digital?

                You can tell me, I won't tell a
                soul. Because if you say it's
                instinctual, I'm quitting right
                now. Seriously. The way you parted
                your hair? That was so connected.
                And that scene with the matches?
                And when you find out who your real
                grandmother is and run through the
                rain and find her on the porch and
                touch her face? Man, that was...you
                gotta tell Steven how much I loved

                Coronation Egg privately.

                                                                    113.




182   INT. SECURITY ROOM                                            182

      Isabel, the Security Director, and Captain Giordano sit with
      four cops watching a bank of closed circuit screens.

                          ISABEL
                I want to be on record as saying
                that you should have shut the
                entire museum down.

      Isabel keeps her eye on the tourists who circulate through
      the other wings of the museum.


183   INT. MUSEUM -- ENTRY HALL -- DAY                              183

      "Julia" arrives flanked by her "Nation of Islam" guards,
      Frank and Basher. The assembled employees clap and call her
      name. She waves as they take her picture.

      Topher throws his arm around Julia to make sure he gets in
      all the shots. The Museum Director comes up to greet
      "Julia".


184   INT. SECURITY ROOM                                            184

      Isabel watches the security camera feeds.

                             ISABEL
                There!     Right there!

      Isabel points at a screen showing the museum's other
      entrance. Rusty nonchalantly slips into the museum.


185   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY             185

      "Julia" enters and walks up to the egg.       Her entourage
      follows.

                          TESS
                It's so beautiful.        My God.

      Topher looks at the egg--

                          TOPHER
                Kinda small.

      He turns away to look a cute girl on the museum staff.

                          TOPHER
                Hi.

      BACK ON "JULIA"

      She leans in close to the egg.

                          TESS
                I'm not going to set off any
                alarms?

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR
                No. No. Get as close as you like.

      Reuben pops his head in between them.

                          REUBEN
                    (obsequious)
                Julia -- unless you have any
                objections -- Wen and his crew set
                up for the publicity stills.


186   INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM -- DAY                     186

      Rusty ponders a painting like college student trying to
      impress his art history professor. Finally he moves on, into
      another gallery.

      PAN to REVEAL nine uniformed cops trailing behind him.


187   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY          187

      Yen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker.

      He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn.

      Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and
      Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up
      the camera, lights, and flags.

      Each "crew member" carries an odd-looking oversized "light
      meter". Upon closer examination we can see that each device
      has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the
      museum's closed circuit system. The guys are carefully
      placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the
      egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the
      gallery.

      "Studio Execs," Reuben and Linus go to "Julia."


                                                          (CONTINUED)

                          REUBEN
                I was thinking maybe we could get
                you and Topher into some "You
                Always You Never" hats and t-shirts
                for the shoot--

                          TESS
                That's stupid.

                           REUBEN
                    (instant reversal)
                So stupid!
                    (turns to Linus as if it's
                     his idea)
                Idiot.
                    (gingerly)
                Maybe we could put some posters in
                the background--

                          TESS
                I don't think we want to be so
                obvious--

                          REUBEN
                I completely agree!
                    (to Linus)
                Stop trying to turn this into some
                sort of stunt.


188   INT. OTHER PART OF MUSEUM                                  188

      Isabel struts up to Rusty.

                          ISABEL
                This isn't going to work.

                          RUSTY
                I don't know what you're talking
                about.


189   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY          189

      Yen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of "Julia" and
      Topher. "Julia" looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting
      her hands up to block her ears.

      Topher keeps shooting glances at Danny, who is moving around
      flags and lights, ostensibly in accordance with Yen's Chinese
      language orders.



                                                          (CONTINUED)

      Julia sees Topher's expression -- he recognizes Danny from
      somewhere...

                          JULIA
                Okay, thanks everybody. Thank you
                so much.

      She starts to walk out. Topher shrugs and follows her.


190   INT. MUSEUM HALLWAY -- DAY                                 190

      Julia and her entourage barrel down the hallway. Topher
      catches up.

                          TOPHER
                Hey, J Ro, why the quick exit?

                          TESS
                I...uh, I have to take some pills.
                Aspirin. I get headaches.

                          TOPHER
                Yeah, well, with everything thing
                you've been going through I can see
                how you'd need something.

                          TESS
                They're just aspirin.

                          TOPHER
                Right. I've never taken aspirin in
                my life, ever. Can you believe
                that?

                          TESS
                That's amazing.

                          TOPHER
                For me, it's like a control thing.

                          TESS
                Well, with aspirin...it's very
                beneficial.

                          TOPHER
                Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

      They are interrupted by the sound of PIERCING SIRENS and
      CLANGING BELLS -- all manner of alarms coming from the
      gallery containing the egg.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

      Tess rushes back to the gallery just in time to see police
      officers pin Danny and his entire crew on the floor and
      against walls and start handcuffing them. She freezes.
      Can't move.... Her bodyguards (Frank and Basher ) grab her
      and move her quickly out of the area.


191   EXT. ROME POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- DAY                        191

      Three massive Ford Excursion SUV's with diplomatic plates
      double park out front, completely blocking the flow of
      traffic on the narrow street.

      Eight FBI agents climb out of their behemoths and walk inside
      like they own the place. The boss is a 55 year-old agent
      named MOLLY STARR.


192   INT. LOBBY -- DAY                                           192

      Molly Starr steps inside with her posse.   She pulls out her
      badge and hangs it around her neck.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Who's in charge?

      Isabel and Captain Giordano look at her and her team with
      obvious trepidation.

                          ISABEL
                    (tentative)
                I am.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                    (smelling trouble)
                She is.

      Molly gives a slight nod to one of her lackeys.   He thrusts
      an official-looking paper at Isabel.


193   INT. "OBSERVATION "HALLWAY -- DAY                           193

      Molly swaggers down a hallway, followed by Isabel and
      Giordano. She stops at an observation window and looks
      through it to see Danny, who is handcuffed to a chair,
      awaiting interrogation. His expression is impassive.

      She moves on to the next window: Yen. Same impassive
      expression. She continues down the line, Reuben, Livingston,
      and Saul. Each has the same impassive expression. Through
      the final window she sees Linus...


                                                         (CONTINUED)

      He's nervously tapping his foot.   Molly smiles sadistically.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Oh, yeah... I'll start with him.


194   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY                            194

      Molly sits face-to-face with Linus. Isabel and Captain
      Giordano stand in the corner and observe.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                When people think of Italy they
                think of food, wine, the
                Renaissance. They don't realize
                Italy has the scariest prisons in
                the civilized world. You know why?
                They're all leftover from the
                Middle Ages. They're worse than
                dirty; they're damp. They're like
                caves.

      Linus can't look her in the eye.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR (cont'd)
                I'm the only hope you've got.

                          LINUS
                What do you want?

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Testify against the others in the
                Benedict case.

                          LINUS
                I can't do that.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Sure you can. You'll get a year,
                maybe two. The Italian charges
                will be dropped. You and the
                others will be extradited to the US
                this afternoon.

      A long beat.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Think about those prisons. Think
                about living there for twenty
                years, getting out when you're
                fifty. What a catch you'll be.

                                                                 119.




195   EXT. / INT. FBI SUV -- DAY                                 195

      Linus is bundled into the back of the SUV. Agent Starr gets
      in next to him. She motions to the driver. They pull out.


196   EXT. POLICE STATION -- DAY                                 196

      Agent Starr's SUV is followed by three other SUV's and
      escorted by two Rome Police cars.


197   INT. FBI SUV -- DAY                                        197

      Linus stares morosely at the headrest in front of him.

      A long, long beat...then he turns to Agent Starr:

                          LINUS
                Did you tell Dad?

      Before "Agent Starr" answers the agent in the passenger seat
      turns around.

      It's Clint Eastwood.

                          CLINT
                Of course she did.   We're married,
                for God's sake.


198   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                                    198

      Tess waits. A key sounds in the door, and she is on her feet.
      She reaches Danny before he's all the way in the room. She
      kisses him, then remembers she's mad at him.

                          TESS
                Why didn't you tell me?

                          DANNY
                I couldn't.

                             TESS
                Why not?

                          DANNY
                Because you're not an actress. You
                wouldn't have been so real.

                I thought you were going to jail.

                          DANNY
                I'm not going to jail.

      A beat.

                          TESS
                So you don't think I'm a good
                actress.

                          DANNY
                You're a terrible liar.

                          TESS
                I'm a good liar.

                          DANNY
                Where did Benedict find you?

                           TESS
                He...

                          DANNY
                At your parent's house.

                          TESS
                That was...okay, so I'm not a good
                liar. So what. You're good enough
                for both of us.

                           DANNY
                Exactly.


199   EXT. CIAMPINO AIRPORT -- DAY                             199

      The motorcade of FBI SUV's pulls through the security gate
      and drives toward a US government Gulfstream parked on the
      flight line.

      Isabel watches with Captain Giordino and Commander Andriotti.

      Linus, Saul, Yen, Livingston and Reuben get out of the SUVs,
      all of them beaming. They hug Linus's mom and dad and mount
      the steps to the plane. Then Rusty gets out, says goodbye to
      everyone, and heads for Isabel.

                          ISABEL
                    (eyes go wide)

                 Call the tower! Don't let that
                 plane take off!

      Giordano stares blankly at her.   But he doesn't move.

                          ISABEL (cont'd)
                Do something! Do you realize
                what's happening?! Do you
                understand what's going on?!

                    (deadpan)
                Yes, absolutely.

      Isabel blinks.   It takes a second to hit her. Rusty
      approaches.

                          RUSTY
                Guys. Get on there before they
                leave without you. Thanks.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                    (speaking like an
                     American)
                Hey, no problem. Good seeing you,
                man.

                          ANDRIOTTI
                Take care. See you back home.

                          RUSTY
                Thanks, Scooter.

      Isabel is dumbstruck.


200   EXT. TOULOUR'S VILLA -- DAY                                200

      Toulour pulls up in a Ferrari.    His butler gets the door for
      him.

                          BUTLER
                How was Rome, air?

      Toulour answers by handing a small velvet bag to his butler
      (a bag just big enough to hold the coronation egg).

                          TOULOUR
                Put this in the safe, would you?

                Of course, sir. Your guests are on
                the veranda.

                          TOULOUR
                Guests?


201   EXT. CIAMPINO AIRPORT -- DAY                               201

      Isabel watches as the "US Government" Gulfstream containing
      all the members of Rusty's crew that she arrested at the
      museum taxis down the runway and becomes airborne. She turns
      to Rusty.

                          ISABEL
                I hate you.

                          RUSTY
                I love you.

                          ISABEL
                This will ruin me.

                          RUSTY
                No, it won't. Not if you come to
                Zanzibar.

                          ISABEL
                What is it with Zanzibar?

                          RUSTY
                It's where LeMarc is.

      Rusty points nearby at another private plane.    The pilot has
      just opened the door and put the stairs down.

                          RUSTY
                That one's ours.     We can be there
                in three hours.

      A beat.

                          RUSTY
                Don't you want to meet him? He
                wants to meet you.

                          ISABEL
                You're asking me to turn my back on
                my whole life.

                Would you miss it?

                             ISABEL
                I'm a cop.     That's who I am.

                          RUSTY
                You're only a cop because your
                father was a thief.

                          ISABEL
                Who died in a Russian jail.

                          RUSTY
                According to you mother.

                          ISABEL
                What does that mean?

                          RUSTY
                It means you should meet LeMarc.


202   EXT. VERANDA -- DAY                                      202

      Toulour walks out to find Danny and Tess chomping on gourmet
      nuts and sipping his special reserve brandy.

                          TOULOUR
                    (to Danny)
                Let me guess, you decided you did
                want to give my lawyer a call. But
                you lost his card.

      Toulour holds out another card to Danny.

                          DANNY
                No, nothing like that. We just
                came to collect our money.

                          TOULOUR
                Not only did you fail, half of your
                crew got pinched! Your plan was
                not good.
                    (to Tess)
                And you don't look anything like
                Julia Roberts! I mean your...
                    (motions ambiguously to
                     her body)
                ...and your...
                    (another ambiguous motion)
                ...and your ears.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

      Toulour stops. Danny and Tess just look at him. Something
      about their demeanor is troubling. Namely, that they look
      completely untroubled.

                          TOULOUR
                Oh, no. You stole it on the way to
                Rome didn't you? I stole a replica.


203   EXT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                               203

      A repeat of the shot of the SMALL, SECURE BOX being taken to
      a truck.

      The truck moves out of the garage and on to the street as
      before. This time the shot continues over to a door on the
      side of the building. A YOUNG KID emerges with a backpack
      over his shoulder.


204   EXT. PARIS STREET -- DAY                                 204

      The BACKPACK KID passes another guy, a NORMAL-LOOKING GUY,
      who, after a beat, follows Backpack Kid.


205   INT. PARIS TRAIN STATION -- DAY                          205

      The Backpack Kid, followed by Normal-Looking Guy, walk
      through the terminal and get in line. We swing over to see
      Normal Looking Guy #2 looking at them.


206   INT. TRAIN -- DAY                                        206

      In motion. We start on the Backpack Kid, who is reading a
      book. The Backpack is beneath his legs. Next to him sits
      LINUS. Across from him is one of the Normal-Looking Guys. The
      other Normal-Looking Guy is a row away, facing him.

      Linus looks at the door of the car.

      SAUL

      Is making his way through the door. He looks drunk.

      LINUS

      Looks down at his copy of the French FHM.

      SAUL

206   CONTINUED:                                                 206

      Gets close and closer to Linus and the Backpack Kid.

      LINUS

      Puts his magazine away.

      SAUL

      Is almost to Linus's row, he stumbles a little, almost falls.

      Then, with a loud WHOOSH the train goes completely dark. It's
      gone into a tunnel. We hear Saul's voice CRY OUT.

      In a few seconds, the train exits the tunnel and the lights
      come back on.

      SAUL

      Has fallen into the lap of the BackPack kid. Linus and the
      Normal-Looking Guy try to help him up.

      He stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat.

                          LINUS
                    (in French)
                He's completely drunk.
      The BackPack Kid nods his head. Linus goes back to his book.
      We drop down to see HIS BACKPACK also beneath his feet.


207   INT. TRAIN STATION ROME, ITALY -- DAY                     207

      Linus walks through the terminal, backpack over his shoulder.
      Suddenly he stops and kneels to tie his shoelace.

      Saul, seeing this and reacting, splits off into another
      direction.


208   INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY                                     208

      Linus and Saul approach the group.

                          DANNY
                What happened?

      Linus puts his BACKPACK down.

                          LINUS
                We thought someone was following
                us.

                                                               126.




209   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         209

                          TOULOUR
                But that means you knew what to
                steal before LeMarc proposed that I
                challenge you for it. That means...


210   INT. RUSTY'S GARAGE -- DAY                               210

      The image from the beginning of the film, with Rusty watching
      the boiling cask. He's talking on the phone.

                          RUSTY
                Gaspar, it's Rusty. How are you?

      And this time we see what be is working on:

      A PERFECT REPLICA OF THE CORONATION EGG.

      In the warehouse in NYC, we see Danny and Rusty "arguing",
      but from a different angle. They are smiling as they yell:

                          DANNY
                I'M TELLING YOU IT'S A DEATH
                SENTENCE!

                          RUSTY
                FINE, THEN STAY HERE!


211   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         211

                          TOULOUR
                LeMarc told you. Of course.

      He looks deflated. It's probably just occurring to him that
      he's never lost before.

      He sits down.

                          TOULOUR
                To teach me.

      He is silent.

      Tess indicates to Danny that they should leave. Danny nods,
      and they rise.

                Well, we'll be in touch to make all
                the arrangements.

                          TOULOUR
                No. Don't go. Please.

      Toulour gets up.

                          TOULOUR
                You are my guests. I will celebrate
                your victory. Besides, you may have
                noticed, I don't like to be alone.


212   EXT. VERANDA -- LATER                                    212

      They are toasting champagne.

                          TOULOUR
                I am feeling more French by the
                minute. To my first depression.


213   INT. TAXI -- DAY                                         213

      Saul and Basher ride to the airport.

                          BASHER
                So I think if you really analyze
                it, you can see that it's
                inevitable. It's time for us to
                evolve, en masse. I have to help
                bring that about whatever way I
                can, you know. Otherwise, the
                trajectory is fixed. You know what
                I'm saying?

                          SAUL
                Mmm. Yes. But I'm through evolving,
                I think. It's too tiring. I feel
                pretty evolved. You know,
                considering.


214   INT. AIRPORT -- DAY                                      214

      Frank and Yen buy magazines. Yen has a copy of an ITALIAN
      TABLOID. The headline screams CO-STAR SAYS JULIA MARRIAGE IN
      TROUBLE. A sub-headline reads HER ADDICTION TO PAINKILLERS IS
      RIPPING THEM APART.

                                                                 128.




215   INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT                                     215

      In First Class. Basher and Saul tip champagne glasses.

      Virgil, Turk, and Linus all crack open copies of their story
      to read.

                          TURK
                I've got an idea for another
                Dominique story.

                          VIRGIL
                Can we finish this one first?

                          TURK
                Just let me tell it to you.

                          VIRGIL
                No.

                          TURK
                It's like three sentences.

                          VIRGIL
                I'm serious; you're asking too
                much.

      Virgil puts on his headset. Turk leans over to Linus and
      begins to speak. Linus, reading, holds his finger up.

      Yen reads a magazine. Reuben glances at it.

                          REUBEN
                May I look at that when you're
                through with it?

      Yen says something. It would seem he is okay with that.

      Livingston speaks into his VOICE RECORDER.

                All in all, it was depressingly
                familiar. The forced camaraderie,
                the hollow smiles. Scared to take a
                moment's reflection. Scared to
                imagine a different life. We
                behaved like boys.

      He begins to weep, quietly, but very quickly regains his
      composure.

216   EXT. VILLA -- NIGHT                                        216

      Tess and Danny enjoy the sunrise.

                          TESS
                When do you want to go back?

                          DANNY
                Feel like traveling?

                          TESS
                Yeah. Don't you?

                            DANNY
                Yeah.

      Toulour enters with THE LAST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in tow.

                          TOULOUR
                Tess. Danny. This is Monica
                Bellucci.

      And indeed it is.

                            MONICA
                Hello.

                            TESS & DANNY
                Hello.

                          TOULOUR
                We're thinking of taking a trip to
                the states. Take a look around.
                We'd love to meet some of your
                friends while we're there.
                Actually, one friend in particular.


217   EXT. SKY OVER ZANZIBAR -- DAY                              217

      We follow the Gulfstream jet.

                                                                  130.




218   INT. JET -- DAY                                             218

      Isabel looks out the window. Rusty watches her, She looks
      over at him, then back out the window.


219   EXT. BEACH HOUSE -- DAY                                     219

      Stunning. Classic. Rusty and Isabel pull up.

      He takes her hand and leads her inside.


220   INT. BEACH HOUSE -- DAY                                     220

      Rusty and Isabel walk through the house.

                          RUSTY
                There he is.

      Rusty indicates the back porch. A figure sits in a lounge
      chair, reading a book. This is LEMARC.

                          RUSTY (cont'd)
                Gaspar!

                          ISABEL
                Gaspar? That was my fa--

      Isabel looks to the porch just as LE MARC, her father, turns
      to face her. She goes to him and they embrace.

                          ISABEL (cont'd)
                Daddy.

      LeMarc looks to Rusty.

      Rusty salutes, makes a drinking gesture and heads for the
      kitchen.

      The sound of a jet takes us to

      Staring at this receipt. He looks up.

      REUBEN

      Is opposite him. They are both being served for lunch by a
      JACKETED WAITER, whose face is continually obscured.

                             REUBEN
                   That's the exact figure, I'm pretty sure.

                             BENEDICT
                   Yes.

                             REUBEN
                   So we're clean?

                             BENEDICT
                   You want it in writing?

                             REUBEN
                   I'll take your word.

                   You're clean.

                   These grudges, they're awful.
                   Nobody wine.

                             BENEDICT
                   As soon as someone retaliates, the
                   situation is out of control.

                This way, there's no need for
                retaliation. Why would there be?

                          BENEDICT
                There's plenty for everyone.

                          REUBEN
                More than plenty. It's just a
                matter of sharing.

                          BENEDICT
                Sharing is good.

                          REUBEN
                It is. Waiter? Can I get sparkling
                water? It's good for my acid
                reflux.

                    (off)
                Of course.

      The waiter turns toward the bar and we see now that he is
      FRANCOIS TOULOUR. He's wearing a STRIPED TULIP in his
      WAITER'S JACKET.

          With the support of the Media Programme of the European Union
          The SOUND of Muay Thai boxing... The Art of Eight Limbs... Thrust
          and move... Feet shuffling across the ring...

                         FADE IN:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES...
          The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows...
          The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.

          ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.

          Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time.
          The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues
          staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly
          he breaths in.

          Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this
          is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing
          at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the
          far wall.

          Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a
          tight fist.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          The SOUNDS of the boxing match reach FEVER PITCH as we TRACK WITH
          Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other.
          The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which
          way the fight will turn.

          One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts
          changing hands...

          The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way
          though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him
          here.

          Again bets are placed....

          PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late
          thirties).

          Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing
          his arm around him, pulling him in close.

                          BILLY
           ... I love violence!

          Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey.
          Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.

          BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is
          immediately on the ropes.

          Julian watches, concerned.

          Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian
          and takes it outside.

          BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the
          tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings
          and backfists.

          As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the
          auditorium.

          Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with
          adulation...

          Julian watches, transfixed...

          Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant
          in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him...
          Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him...

          ... Which is almost like a religious ceremony... The audience
          bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light... A look
          of calm washing over his face... A sense of stillness and peace...
          Enlightenment through victory and violence...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

          Billy stalks the streets of the city of vice. A man on a mission.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT

          Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside
          him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes.
          We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something
          of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have
          gained his approval.

                          JULIAN
           Two fifty, three hundred...

          Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You did well out there. You've got
           something, Liang. Potential, yeah?

          Liang nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Don't spend it all in once place.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

          Billy comes down a back ally and knocks on a door. After a moment
          the door opens.

          The Doorman recognises him and lets him enter.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. UNDERGROUND NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          WE TRACK with Billy as he makes his way through the small
          subterranean nightclub.
          A Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few
          locals gambling...
          He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to
          gamble.
          Billy moves across to a small private corner...
          ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking
          Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts
          up between him and another Thai Man.
          The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it
          suddenly gets out of control... Billy starts viciously hitting
          the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          A fan does what it can to cool Julian down as he counts out money
          at his desk. Sitting opposite him, feet on the table, is Gordon,
          Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got...
          Julian's phone rings. He interrupts his counting. Picks up and
          listens...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Hold on, hold on. What did he say?
          Beat as Julian listens. He glances over at Gordon who looks up,
          concerned.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           No, tell him to stay there. Tell them
           both to stay there.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)

           (ON THE PHONE)
           I'm coming over.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

          The Lizard sits outside the nightclub, somehow managing to smoke
          a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from
          his nose with a handkerchief.
          Julian and Gordon arrive.

                          JULIAN
           He still in there?

                          THE LIZARD
           ... No.
          Beat... Julian glances at Gordon.

                          JULIAN
           You told him I was coming...

                          THE LIZARD
           Wouldn't listen...
          Julian stares at him...

                          JULIAN
           Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.
          The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the
          bloodstain to Julian.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           When was the last time you slept?
          The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes.

                          THE LIZARD
           Just cause I ain't slept for three days,
           don't mean I don't know right from
           wrong... and your brother has become
           a real problem...
          Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices
          this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           You're not going to cause another
           ruckus in my club now - are you?
          A long pause as Julian considers it.

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          THE LIZARD
           Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and
           then he broke my face...
          Julian turns to Gordon.

                          GORDON
           Like I always said. One day he's going
           to meet the devil.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           You know where he is now?
          The Lizard stares at Julian.

                          THE LIZARD
           Bangkok has millions of people my
           friend. You and your brother, you're
           lost to my world...
          The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian...

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           So what you going to do? You wanna come
           in? Very good amphetamine in here...
          Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen.

                          JULIAN
           You go. I'm gonna look around. See if
           I can find him.

                          GORDON
           Sure--?

                          JULIAN
           Go on.
          He turns back to The Lizard.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Which way'd he go?
          The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns
          and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club.
          The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.

                          THE LIZARD
           His brother didn't pay.

           Now it's your problem.

           You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.
          Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money...

           How much...?
          ...and The Lizard smiles for the first time.

          Julian is talking to Ma Long, fifties, the mother figure to a
          group of girls who stand in the background.

                          JULIAN
           You seen Billy?

                          MA LONG
           Not this evening.
          A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares
          at her, stone faced.

                          JULIAN
           Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking
           for him, yeah?

                          MA LONG
           He's not coming in. I tell him to stay
           away. He hurt one of my girls Julian.
           Not good...
          Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few
          to Ma Long.

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him
           I'm looking for him...
          Ma Long nods as she takes the money.
          Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again.
          Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.

          Billy's so wasted he's bumping into people. He starts window
          shopping the various brothels that line the street: groups of
          girls smiling at him... Anything for a price...
          PICK OUT one particularly young-looking girl. Just fifteen.
          She makes eye contact with Billy... He smiles... Pulls out a roll

          Julian out in the middle of the road. Girls on the pavement, girls
          in the windows. A steady line of punters cruising past.
          He stands alone. Focussed. Watchful. An island in a sea of neon.
          It feels ominous. Like something really bad's about to happen...

          out of stone. The neon lights bleed over his face in a seemingly
          unending flow as he's driven towards his destination.

          INT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Chang makes his way up the stairs to a landing where a GROUP OF
          POLICEMEN are gathered. Their circle opens up as Chang approaches
          and they bow as he joins them - like he's a God. One of the group,
          Kim Han Ho, gestures towards the door of Room 610 where TWO COPS
          stand guard. Chang gives a nod and the door is opened.

          INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT

          Chang stands silhouetted in the doorway. Stepping into the room
          he moves into the light in CLOSE UP. His face is a mask.
          The bed is drenched in blood. The fifteen year old prostitute
          lies naked on her back. She's dead, her body having been savagely
          beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong.
          Billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants, his eyes glazed,
          staring at MTV, a bottle of Mehkong whiskey in his hand, a crack
          pipe on the floor.
          Chang stares at him, giving nothing away.

          A young cop, Daeng, who has been watching Chang, summons up courage

                          (IN THAI)

           He was...
          Before Daeng can ask another questions, two more cops lead an
          older Thai man, Choi Yan Lee (50's, overweight, dragged straight
          from his bed) down the corridor towards the crime scene.

          INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT

          As Choi Yan Lee is delivered to the doorway, Chang gets up and
          goes over to him.
          A moment of uncertainty in Choi Yan Lee's face. Fear. He doesn't
          know why he's been brought here. He looks for some comfort from
          Chang. Chang gives him nothing.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT

          Chang leads Choi Yan Lee to the doorway. Slowly Choi Yan Lee realises
          what he's looking at. His daughter. Dead. Mutilated.
          Every father's worst nightmare.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Is this your daughter?
          Beat.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Yes.

                          (IN THAI)
           How could you?
          ... but Choi Yan Lee just stares at his daughter. Finally:

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           ... What?

                          (IN THAI)
           How could you let this happen?

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I didn't do anything.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Well now's your chance.
          A long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand
          what Chang is suggesting. Chang stands back.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Do what thou will.
          Choi Yan Lee nods. Chang leaves the room, closing the door behind
          him.

          we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death.
          ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared. Phaiban puts a
          reassuring hand on his shoulder.
          As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming
          out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck
          snapping. And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down
          on his body.

                          (IN THAI)
           How else can we make money? Four
           daughters. No sons. What else could I
           do?
          Daeng watches as Kim opens the boot and pulls something out. He
          walks towards Chang and hands it to him. Daeng sees that it's
          an axe.

           been murdered.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           This isn't about her. This is about your
           other three daughters and making sure
           you don't forget them.
          Chang nods to Kim and Phaiban who grab hold of Choi Yan Lee. Kim
          slips a plastic strap around Choi Yan Lee's arm, using it as a
          tourniquet. They wrestle him to the ground and pull his arm out.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me.
          Chang approaches with the axe. He stops for a moment. Looks down
          at him...

          Chang slams down the axe, severing Choi Yan Lee's arm at the elbow.

          He lies back on the bed, surfing through two hundred TV channels.
          Settles on a boxing match. Starts drifting off...
          As he drifts we hear the SOUND OF SINGING. A karaoke rendition
          of 'I Hung My Head' by Johnny Cash.

                          VOICE
           I set off running
           to wake from the dream
           My brother's rifle
           went into the sheen
           I kept on running

           The sheriff he asked me
           Why I had run
           And then it came to me
           Just what I had done
           And all for no reason
           Just one piece of lead
           I hung my head
           I hung my head.

          Chang stares at it and smiles - picks it up and pins it to the

           So now that they've caught him... What

          Kanita thinks for a moment.

                          (IN THAI)
           Put him in jail.

                          (IN THAI)
           But he blew down all their houses. Would
           you want to keep a pet that could do
           that?
          Kanita shakes her head.

                          (IN THAI)
           They could ask him...? Very nicely?
          Chang picks up the soft toy. Peels off a sticker from a sheet
          and places it between its eyes. Satisfied with his work he puts
          the soft toy back in the middle of the game.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           "And so the king and the fairies that
           lived in the village said to the
           creature: this is your mark which will
           stay with you forever. If you ever try
           and blow down our village again, it will
           heat up until it boils your brains, for
           it has magical properties. Go in peace.
          Kanita nods, happy with the judgement. She picks the soft toy
          up and 'walks' it away from the village of the dolls.

          Chang walks into his bedroom where his wife Nadee is just waking
          up. He kisses her good morning.
          As he starts to undress, she starts to get dressed. They share
          a smile about this. Finally Chang lies down on the bed and closes
          his eyes. Nadee kisses him good night.

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / BEDROOM - DAY

          As Chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light
          of the day - but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside
          as it goes about its frenetic everyday business.
          The CAMERA MOVES through the apartment, briefly settling on the
          sleeping Chang, then roaming through the various rooms, PICKING
          OUT different objects...
          We see that Chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector
          - the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs
          and other bits of movie memorabilia...
          Amongst the many family photos we also PICK OUT several pictures
          of Chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like
          a very successful career as a Thai boxer.
          At the end of the tour we're back with Chang. We ZOOM IN to a
          tight CLOSE SHOT.

          We see a hotel room door and hear a knock - Julian ENTERS FRAME
          and opens to reveal...
          ...Two Thai girls - one being Mai - standing in the hallway. Julian
          lets them enter.
          Mai embraces Julian, kissing him on the mouth as Julian closes
          the door.
          They turn to consider the other girl who is starting to undress.
          She smiles compliantly, eager to please.
          Julian turns back to Mai and kisses her again. As the kiss becomes
          more passionate, the other girl joins them and the three of them
          begin to have sex.

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY

          Chang walks down the streets towards a school. Standing at the
          gate, Kanita is waiting for him. He hugs her and they hold hands
          as they continue down the crowded street.

          Chang waits patiently at the counter as Kanita sorts through
          various dolls, trying to choose which one to buy...
          Chang looks round and gazes out the window into the street where
          pedestrians stream past. Suddenly Chang has a strange VISION:
          All the women disappear. In the street there are only men.
          We cut to a CLOSE UP of Chang and then back to his VISION again:
          Now all the men have gone and he can see only women.
          Back to the CLOSE UP of Chang who continues staring out of the

                         WINDOW:
          ... where everything is back to normal. Men and women walking
          up and down the sidewalk.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

          The remnants of various room service orders litter the floor along
          with the trappings of a heavy session: empty bottles of alcohol,
          drug paraphernalia, etc.
          Julian lies sleeping, entwined in the limbs of the girl...
          There is a knock on the door. Julian and the girl ignore it.
          A pause and then Julian's mobile phone starts ringing. He doesn't
          answer.
          The knocking starts up again, this time louder. Finally:

                          JULIAN
           Julian's not here mate. Fuck off...
          Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Julian?
          Still they ignore him. Either too wasted or too tired to do anything
          else.

           GORDON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Julian...? I need to talk with you...
          Beat. Finally Julian answers with zero energy...

                          JULIAN
           What is it?

           GORDON (O.S.)
           It's about Billy...

                          JULIAN
           I can't deal with my brother right
           now...
          Beat.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           He's dead...
          Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs.

                          JULIAN
           What?
          No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his
          body and slowly opens the door.
          Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's
          crew.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What happened?

                          GORDON
           They found his body in a hotel room...
          Julian doesn't know what to say... Neither does Gordon.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Look, get dressed and I'll see you
           downstairs.
          Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out
          the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He
          glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed.
          He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on
          make up.

                          MAI
           What happened?
          Julian looks at her.

                          JULIAN
           Someone killed Billy...
          The camera ZOOMS IN on Mai.

          any emotion.
          He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him.

                          GORDON
           What do we do?

                          JULIAN
           For now... We wait.

          Julian stares up at the night sky, his mobile phone gripped tightly
          in his hand. He puts the phone down.
          He looks out across the city again then back to the phone.
          It's like he's scared.
          He picks it up quickly and dials. A moment as it rings then it's
          answered.

                          JULIAN
           Hello Mum.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           It's me... Julian... Something's
           happened.

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - DAY

          The CAMERA tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging
          to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her
          forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides
          towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This
          is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother
          of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok.
          She hands her passport over to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           I'd like to check in now please.
          The Concierge checks the computer.

                          CONCIERGE
           I'm afraid the room won't be ready until
           four o'clock.
          Beat... Jenna just stares at him...

                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           ... It's policy

                          JENNA
           I'd like to speak to your manager.
          Beat.

                          CONCIERGE
           Yes of course...
          The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.

                          MANAGER
           Good afternoon madam, what seems to be
           the problem?

                          JENNA
           Listen to me... I've just travelled six
           thousand miles to see the corpse of my
           first born son and I haven't slept for
           thirty hours and he says I can't go to
           my room.
          The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her
          force...

                          MANAGER
           I'm sorry madam...

                          JENNA
           How much?

                          MANAGER
           ... it simply isn't possible.
          Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes. Peels off a couple
          of hundred dollar bills.

                          JENNA
           ...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the
           fucking key...
          She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around...

                          MANAGER
           Well I might be able to arrange
           something...
          The Manager turns to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           Don't leave the money there. Some
           cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.
          The Manager hesitates.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Put it in your pocket.

                          MANAGER
           There's really no need--

                          JENNA
           Put it in your fucking pocket.
          The Manager takes the money. Pockets it. Places the key on the
          desk.

                          MANAGER

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / ROOM 300 - DAY

          The struggling Porter opens the door and lets Jenna in. She walks
          into the suite and gives it the once over.
          Satisfactory.
          The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her
          clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece... As soon
          as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room.

                          JENNA
           Hey... Open this.
          Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath,
          beginning to undress.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I need a drink.
          The Porter is stunned.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Well don't just stand there...
          The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling
          the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail.
          Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and
          takes a huge slug.
          The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot.
          Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the
          Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she
          starts talking to him...

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I loved him so much you know... Billy...
          Beat. The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Everyone loves their children don't
           they? Well, not everyone, but...
          She looks over at him. The Porter smiles at her.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Do you want to see a picture?
          The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse.
          Opens it up. A picture of Billy.
          She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it,
          not knowing what to do...
          Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally...

                          PORTER
           Madam. I have to return to my station.
          Jenna snaps out of it in an instant.

                          JENNA
           What, yeah, thanks.
          She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the
          money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.

          The elevator doors open. Julian steps out into the empty hallway.
          Everything is normal... But everything is also not normal.
          The CAMERA tracks from behind as Julian walks - looking at the
          doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one:
          He knocks but there is no answer. Realizing the door isn't locked,

          instead of her, Julian sees a man sitting on the bed, his back
          to him. His features are obscured...
          Julian slowly begins to walk towards him, but before he can reach
          out, the figure turns to face him...
          It's Chang. But there is blood smeared all over his face...
          Julian stares at him in horror. Slowly he looks down at his hands
          only to discover that they're dripping in blood...
          We ZOOM IN on his hands.

          He sits up. Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare...
          We hear the traffic of Bangkok. Julian gets up and walks to the
          table... Light up and begins to smoke morphine... He walks to
          the window and looks out over Bangkok...
          His phone rings - Julian answers...

          Beat.

           JENNA (V.O.)
           I needed to be by myself...

          Jenna looks immaculate. She stubs out her cigarette when she spots
          Julian making his way towards her. She gets up and they embrace.
          She holds on to him. A little too long.
          Finally she pulls away. She looks at him for a long time.

                          JENNA
           Could it be have been one of the gangs?

                          JULIAN
           Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't
           popular.

                          JENNA
           What do you mean?

                          JULIAN
           You know Billy... He was eccentric.
          Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian
          even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment.

                          JENNA
           But you're going to find out who did
           it, right?

                          JULIAN
           I'll make sure it gets done.

                          JENNA
           No, it needs to be you that does it.
           We need to show them. Do you understand
           what I'm saying?

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, okay, I'll do it.

                          JENNA
           Good.
          HOLD ON Julian as we bring up the SOUND of Johnny Cash's Ring
          of Fire.

                          VOICE
           Love is a burning thing
           And it makes a firey ring
           Bound by wild desire
           I fell into a ring of fire

          Chang is singing again...

                          CHANG
           I fell into a burning ring of fire
           I went down, down, down
           And the flames went higher
           And it burns, burns, burns
           The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire
          And the cops are all there, Daeng included, watching him...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          Chang's singing continues as we see an assortment of tough looking
          Thai Men listening to Gordon (MUTE).

           CHANG` (V.O.)
           I fell into a burning ring of fire
           I went down, down, down
           And the flames went higher
           And it burns, burns, burns
           The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire
          Gordon explains the situation: what information they're after,
          how much they'll get paid for good leads.
          All the while Julian watches from the background.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

          A montage of Julian's crew spreading out, shaking down their
          various contacts: doormen, pimps, dirty cops, stall holders,
          barmen...

           CHANG (V.O.)
           The taste of love is sweet
           When hearts like ours meet
           I fell for you like a child
           Oh, but the fire went wild.
          One of the crew, the rat faced Charlie Ling, starts talking to
          the Hotel Owner who was there the night of the murder. A couple
          of hundred Bhat notes and he starts talking...

          Chang reaches the climax of the song.

           I fell into a burning ring of fire
           I went down, down, down

          EXT. SLUMS - DAY

          A Tuck-tuck makes its way through the crowded streets driven by
          one of Choi Yan Lee's Three Daughter's.
          In the back sits Choi Yan Lee, his stump of an arm in a sling,
          a daughter either side of him.
          His arm's only just been bandaged up and he's clearly still in
          a lot of pain, his face going into spasm with every bump in the
          road.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S KIOSK - DAY

          Julian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink. Waiting.
          Behind him Gordon, his phone glued to his face.
          On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough
          to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering
          wife Kim Yan Lee. She serves a chilled coconut to a man. As he
          turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking
          member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam.
          We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's
          looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's
          selling.
          They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting
          for Choi Yan Lee to turn up.
          Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching...
          Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the
          bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor.
          Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.
          The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into
          the kiosk that doubles as their home.
          Julian and his men close in.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK

          As Choi Yan Lee enters his home and his daughters make a fuss
          of him, the shutters of the kiosk counter are suddenly SLAMMED

          SHUT.
          They all turn round in panic, but before they can do anything
          about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk,
          followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian.
          Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in
          the air.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           You can't kill me. I'm a cripple.

           KIM YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Who are you? What do you think you're
           doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
          Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to
          Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
          At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's
          face. His eyes lock with Julian's.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Is your name Choi Yan Lee?
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him why he killed my brother.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           You killed his brother. Big mistake fat
           man. Why'd you do it?
          Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He murdered my daughter.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says he killed his daughter.
          Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun...
          Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please.
           I'll give you anything. Anything you
           want. My daughters. My shop. Please.
           I've paid for what I did. Look at me.
          In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward,
          brandishing his wounded arm at Julian. He pulls the bandages off,
          exposing the bloody stump.

           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?
          Julian turns to Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?
          Beat.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says... He says he's paid for what
           he's done. That he's been punished
           already.
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He told me to do it. Then he took my
           hand. Look.
          Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him.

                          JULIAN
           Who did that to him?
          Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then
          stares directly at Julian.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance...
          Charlie Ling looks at him surprised... yet there's a sense that
          deep down he knows what he's talking about...

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           It's a lie - he doesn't exist...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel
           of Vengeance.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING
           He's lying...

                          JULIAN
           Tell me.

                          CHARLIE LING
           It's a story old women tell their grand
           children... 'The Angel of Vengeance'
           is supposed to come down from the
           heavens and judge the living...
           restore karma to the world..
          Gordon laughs... but Julian listens with great interest...

                          JULIAN
           How does he do that?

                          CHARLIE LING
           Leads people to their destiny...
           That's the myth anyway.
          Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:

                          JULIAN
           Ask him who cut his hand off.
          Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Do it.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Who turned you into a cripple - and no
           bullshit this time.
          Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically...

           CHOI YAN LEE

           (IN THAI, QUIETLY)
           I'm telling you the truth... The Angel
           of Vengeance is real... He made me do
           it... You've got to believe me... I've
           already been judged.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says it was The Angel of Vengeance...
          Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't
           find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He
           finds you.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Pull yourself together fat man. If you
           don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock
           and shove it down your throat.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling you the truth. He'll find
           you.
          Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room.

                          JULIAN
           What did he say?
          Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to
          get a better answer out of him...

                          CHARLIE LING
           He said you don't find The Angel of
           Vengeance. He finds you...
          Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing
          his gun anymore. Puts it away.

                          GORDON
           Are we going to kill him or what?
          The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive.
          Julian's got to get out...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
          But Julian's already stumbling out of the kiosk...

                          JULIAN
           Nothing... We're not going to do
           anything... Just leave him. Leave them
           all.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. KIOSK - DAY

          Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air.
          Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious
          artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha
          flying...
          He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around
          him seems intense and incredibly vibrant... The dogs fighting
          on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the
          children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of
          the kiosk, hiding their guns...
          Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings... Finally he stands
          up, but as he does he feels different... As if the axis of his
          world has shifted...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          The CAMERA TRACKS from the side as we see Jenna walk through the
          boxing gym. All around her people are fighting and sparring.
          She spots Julian and Gordon through the large windows of the office.
          They see her and stand up.
          We LINGER OUTSIDE in the training area as Jenna goes through THE

          DOOR...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Boxers train in the background. Jenna, Julian and Gordon sit in
          silence. Finally:

                          JENNA
           Did you kill him?
          Beat. A shared look between Gordon and Julian.

                          JULIAN
           It's a little bit more complicated than
           that Mum.

                          JENNA
           Complicated? He killed my son...
           What's so fucking complicated about
           that?

                          JULIAN
           Mum, calm down...

                          JENNA
           Don't tell me to calm down. I want him
           dead.
          Beat... Julian does not know how to explain the situation. Jenna
          stares at him.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           We don't forgive. Only God does.

                          JULIAN
           I know, you always say that - but this
           is different...

                          JENNA
           How?
          Silence. Julian doesn't know how to answer. Jenna watches him
          carefully...

                          JULIAN
           Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming...

                          JENNA
           What are you talking about?

                          JULIAN
           ...because of what he did.
          Jenna thinks it over for a moment.

                          JENNA
           I don't care.

                          JULIAN
           Why?

                          JENNA
           Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered
           your brother and we're not going to let
           him get away with it.

                          JULIAN
           What if... What if it was The Angel of
           Vengeance?
          Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot.

                          JENNA
           The Angel of fucking what...?

                          JULIAN
           ...it - or he - restores karma and order
           in the world.

                          JENNA
           'Restores' things? Who said anything
           about 'restoring' things?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           He loves all humans...

                          JENNA
           I don't know what kind of spiritual
           journey you're on, but you will kill

                          HIM--

                          JULIAN
           I'm not, I'm just...
          Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... I've got to go.
          ...and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open.
          We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly
          ZOOM IN on Jenna. She turns to Gordon.

                          JENNA
           How's business?

                          GORDON
           It's alright, yeah. Well, what with
           Billy not being around, it's tricky to
           be honest...

                          JENNA
           What d'you mean?

                          GORDON
           Well, we're supposed to be moving five
           keys out the end of this week. But
           Billy's not here, is he?

                          JENNA
           I'm here. Julian's here.
          Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it.

                         

                         

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           What's gotten into him...? Is he high
           or something?

                          GORDON
           I don't know. Earlier today - we had
           the guy... The guy that killed Billy.
           Had a gun against his face. But then
           - nothing...

                          JENNA
           Nothing?

                          GORDON
           Julian let him go. Now there's all this
           stuff about angels... I don't know what
           the fuck's wrong with him.

                          JENNA
           Not like you...
          Gordon smiles at her uncertainly.

                          GORDON
           I know how to do what needs to be done.
           That's all.
          She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable.

                          JENNA
           So tell me... What did he mean when he
           said it was complicated?

                          GORDON
           There's this other guy... Might have
           been involved...

                          JENNA
           So we kill them both.

                          GORDON
           We don't know who the other guy is yet...

                          JENNA
           Okay. Well how about we start with the
           guy we do know?

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          A girl sings 'Another Woman's Man' by Dolly Parton.
          Julian's sitting alone at a table, nursing a drink.
          Mai enters, looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her
          in the hotel. She sits next to Julian and gives him a kiss on
          the cheek.

                          MAI
           Sorry I'm late.

                          JULIAN
           It's alright...
          He drinks his drink. Silence...

                          MAI
           What's wrong?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing.
          Mai looks around the bar... It's half empty - some girls and men
          spread out.
          The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence,
          listening to the song...

                          MAI
           See anyone you want us to take home
           tonight?
          Julian glances round but shakes his head. Looks at Mai.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           What?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing...

                          MAI
           What's with you? You want to get high?
          Beat. Silence. Finally...

                          JULIAN
           I want you to meet my Mum.
          A pause, Mai slightly taken about.

                          MAI
           Is she here?
          Julian nods.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           D'you want me to?
          Julian nods. Mai studies him.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           Why d'you want me to meet her?

                          JULIAN
           To show her... To show that I've got
           something here...

                          MAI
           What, like we're a couple?
          Julian stares at her for a long time. Can't quite say it out loud,
          but the answer's yes.

          Choi Yan Lee oversees his daughter's serving hot food to customers.
          FOCUS ON Liang, the young kick boxer, watching him from across
          the street. Liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light
          of the street lamps. He heads over to the shack.
          Liang asks Choi Yan Lee a question. Choi Yan Lee leans over to
          hear him better. Liang GRABS hold of his hair and PULLS him over
          the counter, SLITTING his throat with the knife.
          Choi Yan Lee's wife and daughters look on as blood floods from
          his neck, over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground
          below.
          Life slips away from Choi Yan Lee in a matter of seconds. Liang
          holds onto him until he's dead and then lets go of his head and
          runs off into the night.

          comes up to him, breathless.
          Gordon pulls out several hundred dollars.

                          GORDON
           Never come back - you understand me?
          Liang nods.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Good...
          Liang takes the money. A proper pay out.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about
           it. Good luck with that.

          INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

          Julian's talking to Liang's Mother and Sister who are sitting
          in front of him, both upset. Gordon hovers in the background...

                          JULIAN
           When did you last see him?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           Last night. He went out.

                          JULIAN
           Did he have any enemies?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           None.

                          LIANG'S MOTHER

                          (IN THAI)
           Someone called him.

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           Someone called his mobile.

                          JULIAN
           Who?

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           She doesn't know. They spoke in
           English.
          Liang's Mother pulls out a mobile phone. Passes it to Julian.

                          JULIAN
           This his phone?
          Liang's Sister nods. Julian scrolls through the numbers. All have
          Thai names against them - except one. Julian considers the number,
          then redials.
          A beat. Then the SOUND of a phone ringing in the same room.
          Gordon looks round. Realises he's busted. Takes his phone out.
          Kills it.
          Julian stares at him. Before he gets a chance to say anything,
          there is a knock on the door.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What is it?

           THAI MAN (V.O.)
           There's some cops here to see you.

                          JUILAN
           What do they want?

           THAI MAN (V.O.)
           Probably just money. You want me to find
           out how much?
          Julian thinks it over...

                          JULIAN
           No, I'll talk to them.

          INT. BOXING CLUB - DAY

          Julian clocks the cops who are waiting for him. He walks over,
          strangely on edge. As he gets closer he sees Chang - standing
          on the other side of the room by the boxing ring, his back to
          him, watching the sparring fighters... Julian stares at him...
          Turns back to the cops...

                          JULIAN
           Good morning officers. How can I help
           you?
          Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's
          in a trance...

                          KIM
           We're investigating the murder of Choi
           Yan Lee.
          Julian recovers. Turns to Kim and shrugs.

                          JULIAN
           Never heard of him.

                          KIM
           His arm was cut off. Here.
          Julian manages to cover his reaction.

                          JULIAN
           I run a boxing club. Not much call for
           one armed men.
          A beat. Mexican stand off.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What's this got to do with me?

                          KIM
           He was the father of the girl that was
           found dead with your brother.

                          JULIAN
           Then I guess you boys have got a lot
           of work to do - so have I, so if you'll
           excuse me...

                          KIM
           That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If
           you could just answer our questions.

                          JULIAN
           Sure, sorry. What do you want to know?
          Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers.
          The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted.

                          KIM
           Where were you last night?

                          JULIAN
           With my mum...
          Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're
          reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian
          like they're bowing down before a God.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You want to speak to her?

                          KIM
           That wont be necessary at the moment.

                          JULIAN
           Am I suspect?
          Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian
          stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of
          Vengeance... Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long
          moment and then turns to Kim.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           This is not the man.
          And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves.
          The cops back off and away.
          ZOOM IN on Julian. Deflated and strangely disappointed... He turns
          to Gordon who's standing behind him.

                          JULIAN
           I want you to find out who that guy is.
           Okay?

                          GORDON
           Sure. No problem.

                          JULIAN

          INT. KARAOKE BAR

          Chang sits on his own drinking apple juice as he watches his wife
          sing on stage. Julian enters, sees Chang but can only see the
          back of his face. He walks over to the bar, orders a drink.
          Julian starts to watch Nadee. When he turns back to the bar he
          sees Chang reflected in the optics - somehow standing right next
          to him, staring at him. Julian turns to face him.

                          CHANG
           Why are you here?

                          JULIAN

           And what do you want?

                          JULIAN

          The question hangs in the air. It's what they're all wondering.

           He used to be a great boxer.

                          KIM
           He has to do it. Since he came out of
           the coma, that's what he's done.
           Whatever's been asked of him, he's done
           it. He can't help it. It's all a

                          JULIAN
           Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this
           way. Trust me.
          Mai gives in. Takes his hand.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CLOTHES SHOP - NIGHT

          Chang picks out a dress for Mai. She takes it, finding it hard
          to believe that he's making her do this...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Three people sit around a table awkwardly. Julian, Jenna and Mai
          (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup. A long silence.

                          JENNA
           So... May, isn't it?

                          JULIAN
           It's Mai, Mum.

                          JENNA
           How long have you two known each other
           then?
          Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first.

                          JULIAN
           A year and a half isn't it?
          Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head...

                          MAI
           ...that sounds about right.

                          JENNA
           Well it's always a rare treat to meet
           one of Julian's lady friends.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, please...

                          JENNA
           So, where did you two meet?

                          JULIAN
           I saw her walking down the street.
          Jenna raises an eyebrow...

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           And I thought - this is the most
           beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I
           just walked up to her and started
           talking.

                          JENNA
           I hear that happens a lot in this part
           of the world... Tell me, what's your
           line of work, Mai?

                          MAI
           I work in the service industry.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before
           you started serving my son, how many
           cocks were you serving? Was it over a
           thousand?
          Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I know girls like you. Just because you
           might be pulling the wool over my son's
           eyes don't think it's going to work with
           me.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.

                          JENNA
           I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by
           and let a dirty little hooker take
           advantage of my son in the vain hope
           that her womb isn't so diseased that
           she can trick him into impregnating her
           and putting another cocksucking child
           on to this earth.

                          JULIAN
           Leave her alone Mum. You've got her
           wrong. She's a good girl.

                          JENNA
           What do you know about what's good?
          Beat. Julian says nothing.

                          MAI
           He's good to me...

                          JENNA
           Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really
           happy for you--

                          JULIAN
           Mum!
          A pause.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           The cops came by my club today.
          Beat. She stares at him.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           They're investigating a murder. The
           guy that killed Billy turned up dead
           this morning.
          Jenna looks bored. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA
           Oh really, shame that, still, live by
           the sword, die by the sword...

                          JULIAN
           I know it was you, Mum.

                          JENNA
           I did what had to be done.

                          JULIAN
           He was there. He was with them.

                          JENNA
           Who?

                          JULIAN
           The Angel of Vengeance.

                          JENNA
           D'you kill him?

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          JENNA
           Cause he as good as killed Billy. What
           I want to know is, what are you going
           to do about it?

                          JULIAN
           I'm not going to kill him...

                          JENNA
           Yes you are. You're going to do it for
           me and you're going to do it for your
           brother.

                          JULIAN
           This isn't about Billy. This is about
           me. All my life I've been running...

                          JENNA
           That's right you cunt, cause you always
           run away whenever there's a problem...
           just like you're running away from
           killing this fucking Angel of whatever

                          -

                          JULIAN
           - his name is Chang-

                          JENNA
           Chang?!
          Mai stands up.

                          MAI
           I should be going now.

                          JENNA
           Sit down you cunt.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, don't talk to her like that.
          Mai sits down.

                          JENNA
           So what am I left with?
          Julian stares at her.

                          JULIAN
           Me.
          Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror
          behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted
          by the glass.

                          JENNA
           You're right. We're family. We stick
           together. But Billy was family too.

                          JULIAN
           Billy was a fuck up... He deserved
           everything he got. You know it and I
           know it.

                          JENNA
           That's it. I'm not listening to this.
           I don't ever want to hear you mention
           his name again... Do you hear me?

                          JULIAN
           Yeah we were brothers, but we were never
           close... And he was only in Bangkok
           cause you couldn't control him. So you
           sent him to me--

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           -- So you sent him to me and what could
           I do?

                          JENNA
           You could have protected him.

                          JULIAN
           I did what I could. And that's more than
           you ever did.

                          JENNA
           I would've done anything for him. Okay,
           he wasn't born with as many advantages
           as you were. He struggled with things.
           But I always stood by him.

                          JULIAN
           And what did that get him? I'll tell
           you what, a one way ticket to this
           fucking place, just like me.

                          JENNA
           Don't you dare blame me for what
           happened back then.

                          JULIAN
           I'm only here 'cause of you. If you
           didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I could've been someone, Mum. I was on
           my way...
          Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like
          having...

                          JENNA
           You would've been a great fighter...
           You could've gone pro.

                          JULIAN
           Don't you think I know that? And look
           at me now. I'm a front for a drugs
           smuggling.
          He turns to Mai.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           It's true... The whole thing's a front.
           Every day I see kids coming in with great
           potential. And every day I see kilos
           of heroin going out. And it's all
           because of you, Ma. You and the money
           and the drugs.
          Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up.
          He quietens down...

                          JENNA
           At least you're not behind bars and
           that's more important to me.
          Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say
          this.

                          JULIAN
           That's right Mum. That's what's more
           important to you. But what about me?
           Sometimes I think you only got me out
           of there so the cops couldn't trace it
           back to you...
          Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ...that's right Mum. Think about it.
           With me gone you were safe. And it turned
           out to be good for business as well.
           All very convenient.
          Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands
          now shaking.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Is that what happened with Billy? Did
           Billy become a problem like I did?
           Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big
           fucking problem when he was here...
           Still, at least you didn't have him
           killed.
          Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at
          her. Very intense.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum.
           Doesn't matter what you say. And do you
           want to know why?

                          JENNA
           Surprise me.

                          JULIAN
           'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the
           ring. Me versus him.

                          JENNA
           Well that seems sensible... And what
           do you hope that's going to achieve?

                          JULIAN
           I don't expect you to understand. Cause
           you don't understand anything that
           isn't about you.

                          JENNA
           And when you lose, what's going to
           happen then?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... But maybe this time I'll
           win. Like you say, only God forgives.
           Maybe this time he'll forgive me...
          Jenna turns to Mai.

                          JENNA
           Do you understand what he's talking
           about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking
           a clue.

                          JULIAN
           You never did, Mum.
          A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.

                          JENNA
           I hope you find what you're looking for.
           'Cause if you don't, it's going to find
           you and I'm not always going to be there
           to look after you.
          Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you
           again soon.
          Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then,
          as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves.
          Julian covers his face with his napkin.

                          MAI
           Are you alright?
          He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see.

                          JULIAN
           I'm fine.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'll be fine. In a minute.
          Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Sorry about that.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          Jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception, a look of
          steely determination in her eyes.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          The Concierge and the Manager see Jenna coming towards them and
          brace themselves...
          However, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where
          Gordon is waiting for her.

                          GORDON
           Nice evening?

                          JENNA
           Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you
           know.
          Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           You're a piece of work, aren't you?
          Gordon blushes. Jenna blows out her match.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           No fucking hanging about with you, is
           there?

                          GORDON
           Well, I don't know about that. Just been
           out here a while... Know how to get
           things done.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do.

                          GORDON
           But things are going to shit. Since
           Billy died, Julian's all over the
           place...

                          JENNA
           We'll have to something about that the,
           wont we? But, first things first, what
           about Chang?

                          GORDON
           Who?

                          JENNA
           My son's guardian angel.

                          GORDON
           He's just a retired cop...

                          JENNA
           Good, then he won't be to hard to kill,
           will he?

                          GORDON
           It's not that simple... Is there
           somewhere we can go that's a little more
           private?
          Beat. She raises her eyebrows.

                          JENNA
           What did you have in mind?
          Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial...

                          GORDON
           You can't just going round killing cops
           here anymore. It's not that easy.

                          JENNA
           I didn't say it was easy. But then,
           you're a resourceful man, aren't you?

                          GORDON
           I looked into it. Chang's a hard man
           to get to. None of the Thais'll go near
           him...

                          JENNA
           Well then you're going to have to find
           someone who's not a fucking Thai then,
           aren't you?

                          GORDON
           There might be a way... But Julian can't

          Jenna looks at Gordon - smiles and crosses her legs.

                          JENNA
           Don't you worry about that. There are
           certain things that a mother and son
           shouldn't - and don't - discuss...
          Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Julian sits on a chair, holding his hand over a flame. Mai finishes
          applying make up, comes out of the bathroom wearing her red dress.
          She watches him for a moment.

                          MAI
           What are you doing?

                          JULIAN
           Seeing when it hurts.
          Mai watches him. He doesn't flinch.

                          MAI
           I'm going to go.
          Julian takes his hand off the flame. Sees she's left the clothes
          he bought her behind.

                          JULIAN
           Didn't you like what I got you?

           It's fine, but you know... It's not my
           style.

           What do you mean?

                          MAI
           Maybe you should give it to your mother.

                          JULIAN
           Don't to be so hard on her. Her life
           hasn't been easy.

                          MAI
           Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch.

           Don't say that, okay? You don't know
           what you're talking about. She'd do
           anything for me.

                          MAI
           The way she talks to you --

                          JULIAN
           Don't go there.

                          MAI
           What? 'Don't talk about my mother'?
           Come on Julian.
          Julian stands up, angry.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           Why don't you fuck her instead of me?
          Julian grabs hold her neck. Throws her hard against the wall.

                          JULIAN
           You don't get to judge her. You think
           she's bad? You should've met my dad.
           But he's not around anymore, and do you
           know why? Cause she loved me too much.
          He lets go of her neck. Mai rubs her neck.

                          MAI
           You're fucked.
          He pulls money out of his pocket.

                          JULIAN
           How much do I owe you?
          He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it.

                          MAI
           Fuck you.
          She opens the door, sets fire to the money, and walks out of the
          room.
          As she walks down the hotel corridor, Julian slams his fists into
          the wall.

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT

          A mixed clientele. High class. Asian and European. But there's
          an edge to the atmosphere. The music's that bit too loud, that
          bit too aggressive. And the people inside don't look like they're
          having a good time. It seems evil. Sleazy.
          Jenna introduces herself to Yuri Karkov, a well dressed and
          charismatic Russian in his forties who is surrounded by Thai girls
          and fellow Russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard,
          Dimitri.
          As the camera TRACKS CLOSER to them we start to hear what they're
          saying...

                          YURI KARKOV
           ... so why do you want to kill a
           policeman? Policemen are good. They
           mind their own business and keep the
           streets safe. Stop people stealing my
           cars...

           You really want to know?

                          YURI KARKOV
           Yes. It may effect the price.

                          JENNA
           He killed my son.

                          YURI KARKOV
           Revenge. Pricey...

           This is Bangkok. Nothing's that
           expensive.

                          YURI KARKOV
           You're right. Most things are cheap in
           Bangkok. Especially life... We'll take
           care of this business for you. But it
           won't be easy and it won't be cheap.

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          A crappy van pulls up outside. Out get three Cambodian men. Very
          poor, badly clothed. They look like farmers. Only they pull out
          semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng
          and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen
          walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE.
          An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all
          the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering
          the room with broken glass.
          Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover.
          Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and
          his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
          Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair.
          In it, his pistol.
          The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull
          it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting.
          A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's
          jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs
          it and returns fire, letting off four rounds.
          He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman
          Two sees this and sprays at Chang -
          - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again,
          shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times.
          Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon
          jams. He drops his weapon and runs.
          Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him.
          He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood
          from his chest.
          Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat
          as he waits. As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken,
          running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and
          starts to pull away.
          Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down.
          The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open
          doors.
          Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires
          off two rounds.
          Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver
          falls forward, dead.
          The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's
          made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere.
          Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you want to die? Do you want me to
           kill you? For what you've done?
          A long pause. Finally:

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           No. Please. Don't kill me.

           Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't
           shoot you as soon as you come out of

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm sorry?

           Not good enough.

           GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)

                          (IN THAI)
           It's my first time. I've never done
           anything like this before.

           I know that. You're wearing sandals.
           Hitmen don't wear sandals.
          The door opens. Sandaled feet step out of the van. Gunman Three
          comes out with his hands up, falling to his knees. Chang continues
          to point his weapon at the unarmed man.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Give me a reason.
          The Cops appear behind him in the doorway. Chang holds his ground.
          His finger twitches. It looks like he's going to pull the trigger.

                          GUNMAN THREE

                          (IN THAI)

                          (IN THAI)

          Flanked by the Cops, Chang frog marches Gunman Three through the
          crowds, passing various stalls that seem to sell anything you
          could ever want for your TV, computer or Hi-fi.
          Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and
          fretting about which way to turn at every junction in the
          warren-like market.
          Finally they reach the entrance to a particular shop.

          Chang enters, followed by the others. Gunman Three is incredibly
          relieved to have found it. Li Po stands behind the counter - beside
          him sits Pan, a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped.
          As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three
          next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting
          there...
          He approaches them with a heavy sigh.

           Can you turn the music off. It won't
           be long, I promise.
          The music's killed.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           That's better. Thank you very much...
          Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone.
          Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white.
          Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in
          Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri
          winces. Chang shakes his head.
          Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across
          to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear.
          Dimitri answers. Chang speaks through the phone.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You're under arrest...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - LATER

          WE TRACK IN on Dimitri as he stares at Chang, a rabbit in the
          headlights. Chang slowly sits down next to him. Talks to him in
          English.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           I need information.
          Phaiban spins a spotlight onto Dimitri.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           And you're going to help me.
          Suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts. It's as if
          Dimitri and Chang are locked into some kind of surreal
          performance...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           Whether you like it or not.
          Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear.

                          DIMITRI
           It was an English woman - she wanted
           you dead...
          A beat. Not what Chang expected...

                          CHANG
           Why?

                          DIMITRI
           Said you... murdered her son....

                          CHANG
           Who was she?

                          DIMITRI
           I don't know...

                          CHANG
           How did she know me?
          Dimitri shakes his head. He really doesn't know.

                          DIMITRI
           She asked for you by name...

                          CHANG
           And what's my name?

                          DIMITRI

                          CHANG--
          Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know
          what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind
          by Phaiban.
          Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I see the way you look at my people.
           The way you abuse them with your eyes.
           For this, I take your sight.
          He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes. Gauges them out.
          Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in
          Russian...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           You live in my country, but you fail
           to learn our language. You don't even
           try. For this I take your tongue...
          Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on
          his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of
          his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off.
          ...Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying
          animal...
          Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around
          the room like a chicken without a head...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           You had opportunities. You could have
           chosen other paths... But you wouldn't
           listen... For this I give you
           silence...
          Chang grabs Dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear. First one
          side, then the other.
          SOUND OUT. We can't hear Dimitri's screaming. We can't hear
          anything at all.
          Beat.
          MUSIC STARTS. Painful and beautiful, but also tacky... The opening
          bars to one of Dolly Parton's classics. Karaoke style.

           NADEE (V.O.)
           If I should stay, I would only be in
           your way.
           So I'll go, but I know I'll think of
           you every step of the way.
          And Chang with his crew just stare at the tortured Russian as
          he screams until his lungs are ready to burst.

           Bittersweet memories that is all I'm

           So, goodbye. Please don't cry,
          Jenna walks in from the bedroom wearing her dressing gown and
          walks over to him - a commanding presence. He makes to get up
          but she pushes him down and then leans down and kisses him hard
          on the mouth.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           We both know that I'm not what you, you

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          As Chang waits for the instrumental section to end, he starts
          to cry, letting the tears flow without embarrassment. Nadee puts
          her arm around him to comfort him.
          The rest of the crew start crying as well, Daeng in particular.

                          NADEE
           I hope life treats you kind

          Julian lifts his fists up. The same fighting pose we saw him in
          at the very beginning. He's ready. Ready as he'll ever be.

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Two figures kneel on either side of the ring. Julian and Chang.
          Both wearing Mongkol. Totally still.
          The ceremonial music begins...
          Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient,
          traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried
          out before a fight takes place.
          It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their
          arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing
          shapes and outlining fighting positions.
          As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative;
          now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches
          that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost
          beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about
          to follow...

           FADE OUT.
          The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring
          up the SOUND of the baying crowd. Chanting. Screaming. Wild
          excitement. Ready for the fight they've all been waiting for...

                         FADE IN:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside
          him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.
          In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple
          of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.
          The first bell sounds. Five second warning...
          Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers
          him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.
          Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.
          The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang
          walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between
          them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.
          Then a look between the two fighters.
          Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks
          back at him without emotion.

                          REFEREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Fight.
          Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack
          first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps
          his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right
          leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of
          Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his
          left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's
          too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps
          back.
          Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an
          attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,
          connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.
          Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.
          Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.
          Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.
          He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.
          Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike
          with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack
          was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and
          uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects
          with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.
          Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds
          over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs
          and punches to his upper body and face.
          Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to
          the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under
          Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to
          place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him
          fall down.
          Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make
          the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this
          enrages Julian.
          He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a
          high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns
          with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,
          punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's
          down. But again no killer punch.

                          JULIAN
           Come on.
          Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.
          Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take
          out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.
          Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a
          look of intense anger and frustration.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting.
          Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack.
          A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian
          moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as
          he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own
          kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,
          using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike
          with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.
          PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and
          Kanita.
          Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches
          and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.
          He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.

                          REFEREE

                          (IN THAI)
           Break.
          The two fighters step back from each other. Chang's face is damaged.
          Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds.
          End of the second round.
          Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting
          Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks
          and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing
          Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon...
          End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan
          the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.
          Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring
          into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at
          but can't make it out.
          POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When
          she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the
          fight - urging him to hit harder...
          Jenna then walks back to Gordon...
          On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the
          ring. Looking into the crowd.
          Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.
          Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of
          the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and
          she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he
          knows...
          The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.
          He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.
          The Referee starts counting.
          Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
          Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out.
          Kim watches on, concerned.

                          KIM

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up. Please get up.
          After a long, terrible pause... Chang gets up. He looks over into
          the crowd. Makes eye contact with his wife. It's okay.
          She shakes her head. She can't bear it. Tears running down her
          face.
          Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates,
          confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.

                          CHANG
           It wasn't you, was it?
          Julian shrugs, puts his guard up.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)
           You're innocent.

                          JULIAN
           What are you talking about?

                          CHANG
           It's not your fault.
          Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready
          to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him.
          He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in
          his mind.
          It's not his fault.
          Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left,
          right. Julian just takes them...
          Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the
          middle of the ring.
          Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out
          a roundhouse left kick -
          - which makes contact with Julian's draw.
          SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact.
          He's out cold before he hits the floor.

                          JENNA
           Of course.

          INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT

          Julian turns when he hears a knock at the door. Says nothing.
          Jenna enters and closes the door behind her. She stands there
          for a moment as if considering what to say...

                          JENNA
           You deserved to win. You should've

                          WON--

                          JULIAN
           Give it a break mum. Just... give it
           as rest.
          He steps into the light. She reaches out to touch him.

                          JENNA
           I'll never get use to seeing you get
           hurt - even when you win.

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, well I lost.

                          JENNA
           And did it make a difference?
          Julian says nothing.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I want to know... Did it make a
           difference?
          Slowly he shakes his head.

                          JULIAN
           ... No... it didn't make a
           difference... No difference at all.

                          JENNA
           And how do you feel now?

                          JULIAN
           Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.

                          JENNA
           Don't you see, that's how I felt when
           Billy died...
          Julian studies his mother.

                          JULIAN
           What do you want, Mum?
          Beat.

                          JENNA
           What d'you think I want? I want it to
           be like it used to be... I don't want
           to lose you...
          Jenna starts crying. Could be real, could be an act - hard to
          tell she's so good...

                          JULIAN
           What's wrong Mum?
          She shakes her head. Can't say it.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?

                          JENNA
           He knows... He knows it was me.

                          JULIAN
           Who does?
          Beat. Jenna says nothing. Julian thinks... Cogs turn...

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Chang?
          Jenna nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What did you do, Mum? What did you do?
          Jenna makes her hand into a pistol. Pretends to fire it into her
          skull. She tried to have Chang killed. Julian's speechless.

                          JENNA
           He's going to come after me. And after
           he's come after me, he's going to come
           after you.
          Julian stares at his mother; fragile, terrified, alone.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I'm scared, Julian.
          Julian stares at his mother.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           What are we going to do?
          Julian begins to realize what he has to do... and he looks at
          his hands. Finally...

                          JULIAN
           We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take
           him out...

                          JENNA
           Not just him. We've got to take them
           all out.
          Julian stares at her - the power she has over him...

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Kill them all. The final solution.

          Chang tucks in his daughter. Nadee watches from the doorway.
          Kanita still has some dolls on her bed. He starts taking them
          off. Notices one of them is broken.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           What happened to the princess' head?

                          (IN THAI)
           The monsters were angry. They bit it
           off.

                          (IN THAI)

                          (IN THAI)
           These were new monsters. The woods are
           full of them.
          Chang holds the broken princess' body. A sudden wave of fear washes
          over him. A sense of doom.

                          CHARLIE LING
           "Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave". One
           of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah,

           entire year, waking up as if nothing

          Jenna looks over to Chang.

                          JENNA
           I watched him lose. And he deserved to.
           You were the better fighter. My only
           sadness is that Billy got caught up in
           what he's doing out here. And paid for
           it with his life.
          Kim and the rest of the crew take this in.

           and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a
           killer.
          Chang senses something. Starts to become agitated.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           ... It pains me to say it, but my own
           son is a killer. He killed a cop back
           in England ten years ago. He's been on
           the run ever since. I say son... But
           he hasn't been a son to me.
          Chang stares at the door to the bedroom. Feels the presence of
          someone the other side of the door.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Not for a long time. Not since he killed
           that cop back home... That was ten years
           ago. He's been running ever since. And
           he'll never stop until he's caught.
           Until you catch him.
          Chang starts to push the door open...
          Behind him Jenna stands up.
          Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It
          sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display
          with a feeling of dread.

          Chang screams down the phone:

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)

           GET OUT OF THE APARTMENT!

          ... But Nadee is holding the phone against her chest and can't
          hear Chang as she walks into the living room...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - DAY

          ... where Julian is sitting on the couch wearing the motorcycle
          helmet, a shotgun on his lap.
          Kanita is standing in the middle of the room, staring at Julian.
          Charlie Ling leans against the opposite wall, a pistol in his
          hand.
          Nadee remains silent, trying to think fast.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / JENNA'S ROOM - DAY

          Chang listens to the phone, knowing something's wrong.
          Jenna stares at him, defiant. Their eyes lock briefly. But Chang
          hasn't got time for this. He barges past her and out of the room.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / CORRIDOR - DAY

          The CAMERA TRACKS with Chang as he runs down the corridor in total
          desperation.

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

          The CAMERA ZOOMS towards the main door.

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY

          CLOSE ON Nadee who stares at the main door then slowly turns back
          to Julian. She knows they're trapped.
          Beat.

                          NADEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Kanita - go to your room.
          But Kanita stands still - fear in her eyes.

                          NADEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           ... go to your room now.
          And slowly Kanita walks towards her room as Charlie Ling watches
          her... Kanita closes the door.
          Beat - silence...
          Julian stands up and walks toward Nadee - raises his shotgun and
          blows her head off.
          Blood spatters onto the wall, bits of brain and skull everywhere
          as her body falls to the ground...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY

          Chang stops in his tracks. It's as if he can feel the shotgun
          blast in his heart. He knows what's just happened... He stands
          still. He closes his eyes as if he had only to wish to make it
          all go away... He opens them again to see...
          The street is completely deserted. Chang stands alone in the middle
          of a ghost town.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Julian takes off his helmet that's covered in blood, throws it
          onto the floor and walks toward the front door.

                          CHARLIE LING
           Wait...
          Julian turns back. Charlie Ling nods towards Kanita's room.

           CHARLIE LING (CONT'D)
           The kid.
          Julian shakes his head.

                          JULIAN
           No way.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          SHE SAID--

                          JULIAN
           Who said?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           My mother?
          Charlie Ling nods.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What kind of a mother says that?

                          CHARLIE LING
           If you've got a problem, talk to her.

                          JULIAN
           No. We're not doing it.

                          CHARLIE LING
           You don't have to. I will.
          Charlie Ling kicks open the door. Julian realises he can't let
          him do it.
          And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita... Julian shoots him in the back.
          Charlie Ling slumps to the floor.
          Julian approaches the doorway. He looks in. Sees Kanita sitting
          on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at
          his feet. They hold each other's gaze... and then Julian slowly
          bows his head and leaves...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

          Julian walks out of the apartment with the shotgun raised,
          expecting to shoot Ko Sam...
          But the hallway is empty...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY

          Julian stumbles out of the apartment, desperately catching his
          breath. He ends up leaning on a stall - similar to the one he
          knocked over outside Choi Yan Lee's kiosk. Candles and incense.
          Buddha's smiling back at him...
          Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and
          incredibly vibrant... A group of school children, all of whom
          are Downs Syndrome, are crossing the road. Smiles plastered across
          their faces... Julian stares at them... Their presence seems to
          have a calming effect on him, as if they're giving him new energy
          to do what he's starting to realize he has to do next.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CHANG'S HOUSE - DAY

          Chang stares at the body of his dead wife. Perfectly still. His
          crew in the background...

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / RECEPTION - DAY

          Julian walks across towards the lift, the shotgun hidden inside
          his shirt.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. LIFT - DAY

          Lift music. Julian stands perfectly still in the lift as it goes
          up... Just like Chang did before...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          As Julian walks down the corridor he takes the shotgun out - holds
          it out in front of him as if it were a sacred weapon...
          He reaches the door to his mother's room and pauses.
          Julian stares at the door as if it was heaven's gate... He loads
          the shotgun with two fresh cartridges.

                          JULIAN
           Only God forgives. And now mother -
           you will die...
          He rings the bell, raising the shotgun, ready to shoot. The door

                         OPENS -
          - but it's Gordon who opens it, dressed in a bathrobe.
          Confused, Julian continues to level the weapon at his head. Gordon
          backs away into the room.

                          GORDON
           Easy...
          Julian says nothing. Edges into the room. The gun still pointed
          at Gordon's head.
          Julian says nothing. Kicks the door closed with his foot.

                          JULIAN
           Where's is she?

                          GORDON
           She's gone... Picked up Billy's
           body... She's gone home.
          Finally Julian lowers the shotgun.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           Didn't she tell you?
          Julian sits down.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You alright mate? D'you want
           something?
          Julian mumbles to himself... then turns to Gordon. Realisation
          dawning on him:

                          JULIAN
           I'm so fucked...

          Kanita sits in a chair, her father standing behind her. Very formal.
          Kim is showing her various head shots of criminals...
          Kanita shakes her head until Chang puts down a picture of Julian.
          She looks up at her father - nods...

          INT. CAR - DAY

          Jenna gazes out of the window. She takes out her compact and adjusts
          her make up.

          EXT. BANGKOK - DAY

          Jenna's taxi heads over the Mega Bridge, taking her away towards
          the airport.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. UNDERGROUND CARPARK - DAY

          Gordon and Julian walk towards Gordon's car, the sounds of their
          footsteps ricocheting off the concrete walls.
          Reaching the car, Gordon stands by the driver's door as Julian
          heads for the passenger's side.
          Gordon pauses before unlocking the door. Looks over to Julian,
          talking across the roof of the car.

                          GORDON
           We're good mates aren't we?
          Beat. Julian's instantly suspicious...

                          JULIAN
           ... Yeah.

                          GORDON
           I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish
           there was another way...
          Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head.

                          JULIAN
           What did she say? What did she promise
           you?

                          GORDON
           Don't make this harder--
          GUNSHOT. A bullet RIPS through Julian's shoulder. He falls back
          on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms.
          Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You've become a liability. You can see
           that, can't you?
          Julian looks at the wound. It's deep but he's not totally
          incapacitated. He pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt.
          It clatters to the floor.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           And now she wants me to take over. She
           wants me to be the favoured son. What
           am I supposed to say?
          Julian sinks to his knees, leaning over to pick up the shotgun.
          He's got seconds...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           I didn't want it to end like this. First
           I fuck your mother. Then I--
          Gordon turns the corner - but Julian's in position. Two shots
          in quick succession. Both barrels fired at Gordon's chest.
          The force of the explosion FLINGS Gordon's body against the far
          wall of the car park. Dead instantly.
          Julian pulls himself up and stands there, the smoking shotgun
          acting as a makeshift crutch. He gazes at Gordon's steaming corpse,
          appalled by the turn of events...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

          Julian falls out into a side street. He's badly wounded but he's
          going to make it...

          INT. TOILET - DAY

          Julian takes the top off a vodka bottle with his teeth. He pours
          the spirit over his wound. It stings like hell and Julian screams
          in agony.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DUSK

          Julian walks out into the night, the neon glow turning the streets
          into a modern day Hades....
          Although the wound isn't life threatening, Julian's face is pale
          from the loss of blood. He looks like a ghost.
          He sees two cops chatting on a street corner. They don't see him,
          they're not even looking for him, but they remind him. Chang.
          It's just a matter of time...
          Julian keeps walking. Wipes sweat from his face. Looking for a
          place to hide. A hole in the ground. Anything.
          Then suddenly it comes to him. A single idea. A possible way of
          escape...

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          A series of napkins are rolled and placed in a steadily growing
          pile.
          The work is being carried out by Mai who has a lowly position
          in a massive and sterile industrial kitchen. Not the sort of life
          she planed on having...
          A Co-Worker calls out to her...

                          CO-WORKER

                          (IN THAI)
           Mai. Some guy's out there asking for
           you.
          Mai finishes the last napkin and places it on the pile. She walks
          towards the exit, passing her Co-Worker...

                          CO-WORKER (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Don't forget it's supposed to be my
           break next.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Mai comes from round a corner and sees Julian leaning against
          the wall. She checks that they're alone, knowing instinctively
          that he's in trouble.

                          MAI
           What happened to you?
          Beat. Julian almost smiles.

                          JULIAN
           I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't
           want to leave...
          He winces.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... without saying goodbye.

                          MAI
           Who did this to you?
          A pause.

                          JULIAN
           My mother... She made me what I am. And
           now I've got nothing. And they're after
           me.
          Mai stares at him.

                          MAI
           Come with me...
          Julian looks at her.

                          MAI (CONT'D)
           ...to Cambodia - we can hide there...
           You'll be safe there.
          Mai and Julian smile at each other. It's sweet. Innocent.

                          JULIAN
           I got about twelve grand at the club...
           Should be enough to get us there. Set
           ourselves up. Disappear...

                          MAI
           Now?

                          JULIAN
           Right now.
          Mai looks around - they're alone.

                          MAI
           Wait outside...

          INT. / EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Julian watches as Mai comes into the Restaurant from the kitchen
          and walks over to the bar area...
          Making sure no one's watching, Mai starts to pull money out of
          the til...
          Julian looks over at the shop front next to him... A Travel Agency.
          Pictures of holidays and beaches. Paradise. It all seems in his
          grasp.
          Mai comes up to him...

                          MAI
           Let's go.

                          CUT TO:

          Mai and Julian are in the Taxi. He puts his arm around her. They're

          EXT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          The taxi pulls up outside Juilan's club.

          INT. TAXI - NIGHT

          Julian gets out of the taxi.

                          JULIAN
           Stay here. If I'm not out in five
           minutes... Go.
          Mai nods.

                          MAI
           Five minutes.
          Julian nods and slams the door shut. Mai watches Juilan disappear
          into the building.

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          We PAN THROUGH Julian's empty club. It's silent and empty like
          a tomb...
          We PICK UP Julian as he hurries through towards his office.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Back where we first met him...
          Julian flings open the door to his safe and starts pulling wads
          of money into a canvas hold all.
          He's about to leave when he notices someone standing in the shadows
          behind him.
          Slowly, out of the darkness, a series of figures appear like
          vampires... Chang and the Cops. Impossible to say how long they've
          been standing there...
          Chang and Julian stare at each other...

                          CHANG
           Let's go.
          We TRACK IN to a CLOSE SHOT on Julian. It's almost as if this
          moment was inevitable.

          Daeng is driving. Kim sits next to him. Daeng looks into the rearview
          mirror to see--
          Julian and Mai sitting next to Chang. Mai looks scared... Julian
          more accepting of his fate...

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT

          The Police Car heads over the Mega Bridge and continues its way
          out of town.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. CAR - NIGHT

          They all sit in the car in silence.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

          The Police Car pulls up.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

          Chang leads Juilan across the field. The Cops follow a few steps
          behind with Mai.
          Suddenly, and completely unexpectedly, Chang punches Julian in
          the gut... Julian falls to the floor and Chang starts to viciously
          attack him, punching and kicking him.
          Finally Julian, unable to defend himself, is lying on the ground,
          immobile.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up.
          Julian rolls over. Eyes Chang. Slowly he starts to get up onto
          his knees. They continue, Chang forcing Julian to crawl as they
          make their way further into the field.
          Then Chang stops...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up. Now.
          Julian struggles to get up to his feet, but before he does, Chang
          kicks him hard in the chest, sending him back down to the floor.

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say?

                          JULIAN
           Don't hurt her.
          He kicks him in the stomach.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say?

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...
          Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog... Juilan groans.
          Chang squats down next to him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           What do you expect me to do?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... I'm sorry.
          Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Come on.
          Julian stumbles to his feet. The party continue. We see that one
          of the crew is carrying an axe.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          A couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point.
          Chang looks down at Julian who is lying on the ground. The crew
          stand in the background with Mai.
          Chang sits next to Julian.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           When you were born - what's the first
           thing you remember seeing?
          A beat as Julian struggles to understand Chang's question... Chang
          stares at him.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           What do you remember?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           Dark... Darkness.
          Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some
          meaning for him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And do you ever see light?
          Julian shakes he's head.

                          JULIAN
           No... Never.
          Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and
          returns to Mai - stares at her....

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           I am the Angel of Vengeance... I restore
           order and karma. I love all living
           things...
          Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           ...I want you to walk away from here
           now... Do you understand?
          Mai nods.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Good.
          Chang smiles at her.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Go with God.
          Mai turns and leaves. Chang watches her disappear into the field.
          Chang takes the axe off Phaiban and turns back to Julian.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          Mai walks through the field, alone.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          Chang leans down next to Julian and whispers something into
          Julian's ear - so softly that we cannot hear it. Whatever it says
          it instantly has an effect on Julian. He visibly relaxes.
          He doesn't make a sound as he's held down. A plastic strap is
          tied around his arm as a tourniquet. His arm is pulled out.
          Chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then
          his right.
          Julian grits his teeth throughout. Doesn't scream.
          Chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs.
          The dogs tear into the meat, fighting over their prize.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD - DAWN

          Chang and his men walk back towards the car.
          MUSIC KICKS IN once again... the Karaoke version of John Denver's
          country and western ballad...

           CHANG (V.O.)
           Almost heaven, West Virginia
           Blue ridge mountains
           Shenandoah river -
           Life is old there
           Older than the trees
           Younger than the mountains
           Growin' like the breeze.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. BANGKOK - DAY

          We see various scenes of every day life in Bangkok.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           Country roads, take me home
           To the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

          We see kids waiting outside the school for their parents to pick
          them up. Kanita spots Chang, runs towards him and they embrace.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           All my memories gathered round her
           Miners lady, stranger to blue water
           Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
           Misty taste of moonshine
           Teardrops in my eye.
          Chang and Kanita disappear into a crowd of policemen.

                          CUT TO:

          Chang is in his element. Singing like a cowboy.

           Country roads, take me home
           to the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads..
          The Cops sit and watch him. Their leader... Their God...

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Julian is lying in hospital. Bandages covering the terrible wounds
          where his hands once were.
          Mai is sitting beside him. Spoon feeding him food.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           I hear my voice
           In the mornin' hour she calls me
           The radio reminds me of my home far away
           And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
           That I should have been home yesterday,

                          YESTERDAY

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY

          An aeroplane lands.

           To the place I belong

                         

          INT. CUSTOMS - DAY

          Jenna is in the process of being strip searched by the authorities.
          Zero dignity.

           CHANG (V.O.)
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads
          As one of the Custom's Officers puts on a rubber glove, Jenna
          starts to scream out obscenities at them. Mask off, a real monster
          underneath, flailing around for all to see.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

          Chang keeps singing.

                          CHANG
           Country roads, take me home
           to the place I belong
           West Virginia, mountain momma
           Take me home, country roads
           Take me home, country roads
           Take me home, country roads

          And we end CLOSE on Chang. With the sense that the 'country roads'
          have kind of taken both of them home...

     BLACK

     We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then...

     FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY

     The financial district.  Lots of people in suits.  A shaky,
     spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...

     JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a
     tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.  He
     starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and
     dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then...

     WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     As Foley goes inside, we then...

     CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS...

                        LOOKING FOR MONEY?

                  YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

     We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now...

     INSIDE THE BANK

     as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
     while he studies the bank layout.

     Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter
     the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
     area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes
     hands with the man and they both sit down.

     Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller
     window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
     with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA.

                              TELLER/LORETTA
                 How can I help you, sir?

                              FOLEY
                 Loretta, you see that guy talking to
                 your manager, has his case open?

     Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly,
     begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.

                              LORETTA
                 That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant
                 managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
                 but he's not in today.

                              FOLEY
                 But you see the guy with the attache
                 case?

                              LORETTA
                      (looks again)
                 Yes.

                              FOLEY
                 That's my partner.  He has a gun in
                 there.  And if you don't do exactly
                 what I tell you, or you give me any
                 kind of a problem, I'll look over at
                 my partner and he'll shoot your Mr.
                 Guindon between the eyes.

     Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Now take one of those big envelopes
                 and put as many hundreds, fifties and
                 twenties as you can pack into it.
                 Nothing with bank straps or rubber
                 bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I
                 don't want any bait money.  Start with
                 the second drawer and then the one
                 over there, under the computer.  Come
                 on, Loretta, the key's right there
                 next to you.  No bills off the bottom
                 of the drawer.
                      (as she works)
                 First time being robbed?
                      (she nods)
                 You're doing great.  Just smile,
                 Loretta, so you won't look like you're
                 being held up.
                      (she smiles awkwardly)
                 That's the way, you're doing fine.

     We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the
     front door.  When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having
     some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here, give me the twenties.  I'll put
                 'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had
                 to give my partner a sign; that's good.
                 Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds
                 till after I'm out the door, make sure
                 you haven't set off the alarm.  If you
                 have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon
                 between the eyes.  Okay?  I think
                 that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta,
                 and have a nice day.

                              LORETTA
                 You, too.

     Foley heads for the door.  He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk,
     looks back at Loretta.  Foley smiles at her, then turns to the
     Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta...

                              FOLEY
                 She's cute, isn't she?

     The man looks across the bank at Loretta.

                              MAN
                 Uh, yeah, I guess so.

     Foley winks at Loretta and walks out.

                              MAN (CONT'D)
                      (to Mr. Guindon)
                 Who was that?

     EXT. BANK - SAME

     As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Foley tries to start the car.  No go.  He tries again.

                              FOLEY
                 Come on...

     But the car won't start.  Foley bangs on the wheel...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Fuck!

     Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open
     window into Foley's ear...

                              COP
                 I think you flooded it.

     Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling,
     now has his gun pointing at him.

                              SECOND COP
                 Get out've the car, sir.

                              FOLEY
                 Wanna hear a funny story?

                              SECOND COP
                 Shut up and get out've the car.

     And as Foley obliges, we then...

     FADE TO WHITE.

     We hear a MAN GRUNT.  Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps
     through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as
     we realize he's on his way to the rim when...

     ...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     A BASKETBALL GAME in progress.  All of the men, Foley included,
     are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts.  The game is
     rough.  Hair is pulled.  Eyes are poked.  Faces punched.

     A title reads: "GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.  BELLE GLADE,
     FLORIDA."

     Foley is the oldest player here.  He's getting tired, starts to
     lose his breath.  He finally walks off the court, breathing so
     hard he can't even talk.  He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
     to come in and take his place.

     Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath.  He looks
     across the yard to where...

     A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES

     sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards.  All of
     them are over sixty.  One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches
     hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...

     INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:

     As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
     Mal and Lucky Strike packs.  Another tends to a tomato bush in
     a tiny patch of garden near the wall.  Another one sits nearby
     painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.

     Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
     his eye.  He watches as...

     TWO LATINO MEN

     both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop
     and begin stretching out.  One of them nods to Foley.  Foley
     nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks
     over to a guard, PUPKO ("PUP"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.

                              PUP
                 You want something, Foley?

     Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.

                              FOLEY
                 Some people are going out of here.
                 What if I told you where and when?

                              PUP
                 How many?

                              FOLEY
                 I expect you to look out for me, Pup,
                 let me run off work details.

                              PUP
                 Okay.  How many going out?

                              FOLEY
                 I hear six.

                              PUP
                 When?

                              FOLEY
                 Looks like tonight.

                              PUP
                 You know who they are?

                              FOLEY
                 I do, but I won't tell you just yet.
                 Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,
                 right before lock-down.

     INT. MESS HALL - LUNCH

     As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea
     of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
     at a table full of other little Latins.  CHINO -- fifties, in
     shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.

     Chino's "wife", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray
     of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
     with a bunch of bikers.

     Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
     off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too.

     EXT. MESS - DAY

     Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette.  He puts an arm
     around Lulu, starts to walk off...

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Today's the day, huh?

     Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip
     down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next
     thing to having him on a leash.

                              FOLEY
                 You excited?

                              CHINO
                 I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but I see you moved it up.

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 Why you think is today?

                              FOLEY
                 You were out running this morning,
                 sticking to your routine, anybody
                 happened to notice.  But you only did
                 a couple of miles instead of your usual
                 five.  Saving yourself for the main
                 event.  Then I see you inside eating
                 ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates
                 for endurance.

     Chino and Lulu exchange looks.

                              CHINO
                 You want, I tole you you can come.
                 You all right, Foley.  I like you.

                              FOLEY
                 You told me I can come 'cause I caught
                 you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you
                 and Lulu coming out of the bushes,
                 thought maybe you two were making out.

     Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 So what, you finish ahead of schedule?

     Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.

                              CHINO
                 You see what they doing, those posts
                 out there?  Putting up another fence,
                 five metres on the other side of the
                 one that's there.  We wait until Super
                 Bowl Sunday, they could have the second
                 fence built and we have to dig another
                 nine, ten days.  So we going soon as
                 it's dark.  You want -- I mean it --
                 you can still come.

                              FOLEY
                 I appreciate the offer.  And it's
                 tempting.

     Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence
     not twenty yards away.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 But, man, it's a long run to
                 civilization.  A hundred miles to Miami?
                 I'm too old to start acting crazy, try
                 a stunt like that.  You make it out,
                 send me a postcard.

     CUT TO: A NOTEPAD

     where we see someone has written "IT'S MAGIC!" then crossed out
     the "IT'S" and replaced it with the word "LIKE".  We hear THE
     PHONE RING AND...

     REVEAL: INT. ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Miami Beach Moderne.  ADELE -- mid-thirties, pretty, Foley's ex --
     sits at her kitchen table writing on a pad.  She grabs the phone.

                              ADELE
                 Hello?
                      (then, sighs)
                 Yeah, I accept.

     INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

     Foley on the phone...

                              FOLEY'S VOICE
                 Hey, Adele, how you doing?

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & ADELE:

                              ADELE
                 Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice?
                 Next time, leave the engine running.

                              FOLEY
                 That's funny, Adele.  How many more
                 times you gonna gimme that one?

                              ADELE
                 Till it's not funny any more.  What do
                 you want, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 You know that Super Bowl party?  They
                 changed the date.  It's on tonight,
                 eight-thirty.

                              ADELE
                 Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't
                 monitored?

                              FOLEY
                 I said not as a rule.

                              ADELE
                 So why don't you come right out and
                 tell me what you're talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there
                 in the free world.

                              ADELE
                 What's free about it?  I'm looking for
                 work.

                              FOLEY
                 What happened to Mandrake the Magician?

                              ADELE
                 Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired
                 me and hired another girl, a redhead.
                 I'm working on a new business card,
                 pass out to the cafes.  How's this
                 sound--

                              FOLEY
                      (cuts her off)
                 Listen, Adele, the reason I called,
                 that party is today instead of Sunday.
                 About eight-thirty, like only a few
                 hours from now.  So you'll have to get
                 hold of Buddy, whatever he might be
                 doing...

                              ADELE
                 And the one driving the other car?

                              FOLEY
                 What're you talking about?

                              ADELE
                 Well, seeing as you have so much luck
                 with cars, Buddy thought it might be
                 better to bring two.  He got this guy
                 he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn
                 something.

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn Michaels.

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn
                 thinks you guys are real cool.

                              FOLEY
                 He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see
                 Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step
                 on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off
                 first.

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     As MARSHALL SISCO -- fifty -- slides a small wrapped box across
     a table...

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday.

     ...to where KAREN SISCO -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair,
     a knockout -- sits.  She picks up the box and shakes it.

                              KAREN
                 You fit another Chanel suit in here?

                              MARSHALL
                 Something better.  Open it.

     Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present.  Marshall watches,
     takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how
     everyone's looking at the two of them...

                              KAREN
                      (opens the box)
                 Oh my God...

     She pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It's beautiful.

                              MARSHALL
                 It's a --

                              KAREN
                 --Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.

     She leans across the table and kisses him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Thanks, Dad.

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday, kid.
                      (then)
                 You want another Coke?

                              KAREN
                      (checks her watch)
                 Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades,
                 then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.

                              MARSHALL
                 Which one is that?  The ATF guy?

                              KAREN
                 He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now,
                 he switched over.

                              MARSHALL
                 He's still married though, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Technically.  They're separated.

                              MARSHALL
                 Oh, he's moved out?

                              KAREN
                 He's about to.

                              MARSHALL
                 Then they're not separated, are they?

                              KAREN
                 Can we change the subject?

                              MARSHALL
                 What're you doing at Glades?

                              KAREN
                 Serving process, a Summons and
                 Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory
                 life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.
                 He files suit, says he has no choice
                 in what they serve and it violates his
                 civil rights.

                              MARSHALL
                 You know you can always step in, work
                 with me full-time as one of my
                 investigators.

                              KAREN
                 No thanks.

                              MARSHALL
                 You used to like it.

                              KAREN
                 Dad...

                              MARSHALL
                 You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing
                 wrong with them necessarily if they're
                 divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy
                 cop who drinks too much and cheats on
                 his wife?  That's the way those hotshots
                 are, all of 'em.

                              KAREN
                 I really gotta go.

                              MARSHALL
                 We don't get to talk much any more.

                              KAREN
                 How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch
                 the Super Bowl with you?

                              MARSHALL
                 I'd like that.

     She gets up, kisses him again.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks for the gun, Dad.

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY

     Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk.  He looks about the
     cell.  All he's got to show for himself.  It's now quiet on
     the cellblock.  Foley closes his eyes and we...

     CUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM

     A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE
     "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing
     trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.

     Title reads: LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.  LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA.
     And then... TWO YEARS AGO.

     AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM

     Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black,
     Foley's age, shaved head.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner, as
     does Maurice.  GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look, dark shades --
     counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the
     fighter's ear.

                              BUDDY
                 Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's
                 gonna send this guy out in a body bag.

     Foley watches a MAN -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking
     as those around him.  The guy looks nervous, can feel the other
     cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet.
     Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling.  Foley turns
     and watches the fight now...

                              FOLEY
                 Anyone ever tell you why they call him
                 Snoopy?

     Buddy shakes his head.  Maurice dances around the other guy
     now.  Teases him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back
                 when he was pro.  Now you pet him, he
                 goes down.

     The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely
     glances off Maurice's jaw.  Sure enough, Maurice makes a big
     show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally
     goes down.

                              BUDDY
                 I don't believe it.

     Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him
     and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as
     nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's
     pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons.  He throws
     a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning
     technique...

                              BUDDY
                 Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight.
                 Fuckin' pathetic.

     Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now
     stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one
     hand thrust into his pocket.  Foley watches as Maurice stops
     the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the
     fights -- as he comes out into the yard.

                              FOLEY
                 It's Richard Ripley.

                              BUDDY
                      (looking now)
                 The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I
                 didn't recognize him without his rug.

     Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy
     nodding, acquiescent, respectful.

                              FOLEY
                 Dick the Ripper they called him, on
                 account of all the people he ripped
                 off.

     Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he doin' here?

                              GLENN (OS)
                 Three years.

     They look to where Glenn Michaels, the blond guy in dark shades
     we saw in Maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few
     feet away.  He's shirtless, tan, in shape.

                              GLENN
                 He got three years and fined fifty
                 million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking
                 check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed
                 his name.
                      (struggles with the
                       bar)
                 Whoa-- little help here!

                              FOLEY
                 Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or
                 Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those
                 shades on.

                              GLENN
                 You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!

                              FOLEY
                 I guess the bright glare out here made
                 it hard to see the numbers on the
                 weights.

                              GLENN
                 I'll take the shades off.  Just get
                 this fuckin' thing off me.

     Foley helps him get the bar up.  Glenn sits up.

                              BUDDY
                 How do you know he wrote a check?

                              GLENN
                 He told me.  He works the laundry with
                 me.  The guy loves to talk.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney.  I hear he
                 rolled over on all the snitches he was
                 doing business with and got 'em all
                 brought up.

     He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley, one eye always on the
     swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, anybody that can write a check
                 for fifty mil, he says anything I'm
                 all fucking ears.  Like the other day,
                 he tells me how he's got all this money
                 in foreign banks, plus around five mil
                 in uncut diamonds at his house.  He
                 said, quote, "Where I can put my hands
                 on it anytime."

                              BUDDY
                 Cool.  Where's the guy live?

     Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley.
     Again, Ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making
     notations...

                              GLENN
                 Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut
                 diamonds are as easy to move as cash.

                              FOLEY
                 Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              GLENN
                 So.  What's your point?

                              FOLEY
                 My point is, that's probably what you're
                 gonna end up with.

                              GLENN
                 You think he's lying?

                              FOLEY
                 Use your head.  The guys got five
                 million lying around his house, you
                 really think he's gonna tell some
                 motormouth he just met in prison about
                 it?

     A BELL SOUNDS.  Everyone starts walking for the gate.

     Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate,
     Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket.

     SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who
     moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him... his
     left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like
     congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket
     and we see the long metal shiv--

                              BUDDY
                      (watching Snoopy)
                 Here it comes.

     Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs
     him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away.  The Boxer
     stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last
     jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose,
                 even if it's on purpose.

     We hear a WHISTLE BLOW as a GUARD spots the body.  And now
     everyone moves like hell for the gate... except for...

     Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the
     body.

     Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes
     Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks
     to him as they walk into the block...

                              FOLEY
                 You don't wanna be standing there, the
                 hacks start asking questions you don't
                 wanna answer.

                              RIPLEY
                 Oh, uh, right, thanks...

     Foley then moves away.  He sees Maurice looking back at him,
     giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW)

     He lies there another moment when...

     A PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk.
     Foley's CELLMATE jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the
     toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the
     bathroom.  Foley shakes his head and turns away...

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling
     a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door,
     when he sees...

     A WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come
     out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries.

     Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman
     is opening her trunk before coming forward...

                              BUDDY
                 Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.

     She doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the
     groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock.

                              WOMAN
                 I didn't ask for your help, so don't
                 expect a tip.

     Buddy smiles, waves her off.

                              BUDDY
                 That's okay, ma'am.  I'll just take
                 your car.

     She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     In the midst of a remodel.  As door opens and Pup comes in.
     Foley puts a finger to his lips...

                              FOLEY
                 They're right underneath you, Pup.
                 They dug a tunnel.

     Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the
     chapel, eyes on the floor, listening...

                              PUP
                 I don't hear 'em.  Where's the tunnel
                 come out?

     Pup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of
     the pews to a window.

                              FOLEY
                 Second fence post from the tower out
                 there.  Go on, take a look.

     As Pup stares out the window...

                              PUP
                 I don't see nothing there.

     Foley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT
     CRUCIFIX.  He picks it up, starts up the aisle...

                              FOLEY
                 You will directly.  Keep watching.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - DUSK

     As the high beams from her car show the prison parking area,
     then the fence strung with razor wire.  Karen parks near the
     fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone.

                              KAREN
                 Hi.  Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.
                      (beat)
                 He's not?  Could you tell him that...
                 never mind.  I'll call back.

     Headlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind
     her.  The lights go off, then come on again.  She adjusts the
     mirror to deflect the glare.

     INT. THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK

     As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field.
     He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen
     checks her face out in the rear-view.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     As Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor,
     holds the crucifix down against his leg.

                              PUP
                 There some car headlights out there...
                      (then)
                 Jesus Christ...

     Now he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it...

                              PUP (CONT'D)
                 Man outside the fence!  By tower six!
                      (responds to radio)
                 This is Officer Pupko...
                      (then)
                 I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake!

     Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it
     smack against the side of Pup's head.  Drops him clean with one
     swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a
     sound coming from him.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT

     As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car
     door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there,
     crouching down.

     Karen turns on her headlights.  No, not crouched.  The guy is
     coming out of the ground.  On this side of the fence.

     Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the
     ground.  Right in front of her.

     Karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by
     the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised
     there for a moment before taking off into the dark.  Karen gets
     out of the car...

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow
     the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before
     the men disappear into the dark.

     Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he
     gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her
     trunk...

                              BUDDY
                 What's she doing?

     He watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a
     holstered pistol.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     But then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there
     again and comes out this time racking a shotgun.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     And now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and
     raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND.
     Buddy gets out of the car...

     EXT. PARKING AREA - SAME

     As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty,
     standing by the hole they just crawled out of.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands in the air!

     Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds,
     start edging away -- shit, they've come this far.

     They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark,
     then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate,
     to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it
     for the cons.  They take off running...

     Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't
     fire...

     The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it,
     open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are
     cut down as they run.

     The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more
     interested in the hole the convicts had come out of.  Now they're
     standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons
     ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other
     as...

     A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying
     something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited,
     pointing towards the orange grove.

     They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to
     see if they're alive, then keep going.

     The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out.  He takes his time,
     puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an
     honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes.

     Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the
     shotgun on Buddy.  Buddy raises the palm of his hand.

                              BUDDY
                 It's okay, honey, we're good guys.

                              KAREN
                 What're you doing here?

     Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when
     they're already pretty sure what you're doing.  She glances
     around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature
     out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck.

     She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the
     shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip.

     They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still
     up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence,
     past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange
     grove.  A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet that's all the hacks they send
                 out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind
                 the store.

                              BUDDY
                 Why don't we talk about it later?

     He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the
     headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you're just a girl.  What do you
                 do for a living you pack a shotgun?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest, both of you guys.

     Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious
     thought, but what he says is...

                              FOLEY
                 I bet I smell, don't I?
                      (then)
                 Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll
                 get out of here.

     Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk.  She's
     reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when...

     Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against
     the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're
     cuddled up in bed.

     He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the
     gun in his face.  Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then
     everything goes...

     BLACK

     Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing.
     Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You comfy?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 If I could have a little more room.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 There isn't any.  All this shit you
                 got in here.  What is all this stuff
                 anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's
                 this can?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 For your breath.  You could use it.
                 Squirt some in your mouth.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've
                 you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor
                 unfortunate offenders.

     A BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it
     on.  He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he
     looks at all of her now and finally says...

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 Where's your gun, your pistol?

                              KAREN
                 In my bag, in the car.

     They go over some bumps.  We hear men's voices from somewhere
     far off, outside.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know you don't have a chance of
                 making it.  Guards are out here already,
                 they'll stop the car.

     He runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also,
     just, well, looking.

                              FOLEY
                 They're off in the cane by now chasing
                 Cubans.  I timed it to slip between
                 the cracks, you might say.

     EXT. CAR - NIGHT

     As Buddy floors it away from the prison, checks the rearview
     mirror...

     INT. TRUNK - SAME

     As Jack tries to wipe some of the mud off his face.

                              FOLEY
                 Boy, it stunk in there.

                              KAREN
                 I believe it.  You've ruined a nine-
                 hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, went real nice with that twelve
                 gauge, too.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, why in the world would someone
                 like you ever become a federal marshall?

                              KAREN
                 The idea of going after guys like you
                 appealed to me.

                              FOLEY
                 Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even
                 though I've been celibate lately, I'm
                 not gonna force myself on you.  I've
                 never done that in my life.

                              KAREN
                 You wouldn't have time anyway.  We
                 come to a roadblock, they'll run the
                 car, find out in five seconds who it
                 belongs to.

                              FOLEY
                 If they get set up in time, which I
                 doubt.  And even if they do they'll be
                 looking for a buncha little Latin
                 fellas, not a big black guy driving a
                 Ford.

                              KAREN
                 Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass
                 like this.

     More bumps.  Then picking up speed as the road smooths out.

                              FOLEY
                 Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy.
                 Back when we jailed together, he'd
                 call his sister every week without
                 fail.  She's a born-again Christian,
                 does bookkeeping for a televangelist.
                 Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins,
                 tells her about whatever bank he
                 happened to rob.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy.  That's his given name?

                              FOLEY
                      (woops, beat)
                 One I gave him, yeah.
                      (mouths)
                 Fuck...

     from her badge and ID case at the road.

     INT. TRUNK - SAME

                              KAREN
                 So, what's your name?  It'll be in the
                 paper tomorrow anyway.

                              FOLEY
                 Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of
                 me.

                              KAREN
                 Why, are you famous?

                              FOLEY
                 Time I was convicted in California?
                 FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than
                 anyone in the computer.

                              KAREN
                 How many was that?

                              FOLEY
                 Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I
                 started when I was eighteen, driving
                 for my Uncle Cully and his partner,
                 Gus.  They go into a bank this one
                 time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter
                 to get the tellers and breaks his leg.
                 All three of us ended up in Angola.

                              KAREN
                 That's funny.

                              FOLEY
                 I thought so, too.

                              KAREN
                 It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on
                 the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 I believe you would have.  Another fall,
                 I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I
                 don't mean the place next door where
                 some of Nixon's people went.

                              KAREN
                 I know the difference.  You were in
                 Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary.
                 I've delivered people there.  So
                 basically you've spent half your life
                 in prison.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I
                 do a full thirty years, no time off.
                 Can you imagine looking at that?

                              KAREN
                 I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.

     He looks at her, then looks away as we...

                              FOLEY
                 You don't seem all that scared.

                              KAREN
                 Of course I am.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't act like it.

                              KAREN
                 What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I
                 don't think it would help much.
                      (then)
                 I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy,
                 and wait for you to screw up.

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.

                              KAREN
                 You were married?  All those falls,
                 I'm surprised you had time.

                              FOLEY
                 It was just a year, give or take a few
                 days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't
                 get along or anything.  We had fun, we
                 just didn't have that... that thing,
                 you know?  That spark, you know what I
                 mean?  You gotta have that.

                              KAREN
                      (thinking)
                 Uh-huh.

                              FOLEY
                 We still talk, though.

                              KAREN

                 these things never do.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot
                 like a dog, it'll be in the street,
                 not off a goddamn fence.

                              KAREN
                 You must see yourself as some kind of
                 Clyde Barrow.

     And for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on
     the road.  Then...

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm.
                 You ever see pictures of him, the way
                 he wore his hat?  You could tell he
                 had that don't-give-a-shit air about
                 him.

                              KAREN
                 I don't recall his hat, but I've seen
                 pictures of him lying dead, shot by
                 Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't
                 have his shoes on?

                              FOLEY
                 Is that right?

                              KAREN
                 They put a hundred and eighty-seven
                 bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker
                 and the car they were driving.  Bonnie
                 was eating a sandwich.

                              FOLEY
                 You're full of interesting facts, aren't
                 you?

                              KAREN
                 It was May, 1934, near Gibsland,

                 That part in the movie where they get
                 shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't
                 think of her name.

                              KAREN
                 Faye Dunaway.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I liked her in that movie about
                 TV...

                 Network.  Yeah, she was good.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where
                 Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get
                 shot?  I remember thinking at the time
                 it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you
                 have to.

                 It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you
                 were in that car -- eating a sandwich --
                 you wouldn't have known what hit you.

                 You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder --
                 say we met under different circumstances
                 and got to talking, say you were in a
                 bar and I came up to you -- I wonder
                 what would happen.

                              KAREN
                 Nothing.

                              FOLEY
                 I mean if you didn't know who I was.

                              KAREN
                 You'd probably tell me.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just saying I think if we met under
                 different circumstances...

                              KAREN
                 You have to be kidding.

     Silence.  Foley tries to get back to where it was working...

                              FOLEY
                 Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked,
                 Three Days of the Condor.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah...

     They lie there a moment, think about that as we hear THE CAR
     SLOWING DOWN, coasting, then bumping along the shoulder of the
     road to a stop.

                              KAREN
                 I never thought it made sense, though,
                 the way they got together so quick.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.

                              KAREN
                 I mean, romantically.

                              FOLEY
                 Uh-huh.
                      (then)
                 Well, but if --

     The trunk goes dark again as the car's turned off.

                              BUDDY (OS)
                 You still alive in there?

     And the trunk lid raises so that we see Karen and Foley lying
     in the back.  Foley gets out.  Karen doesn't move.

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Where in the hell are we?

                              BUDDY
                 That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's
                 waiting with the other car.

                              FOLEY
                 Okay, honey, come on out of there.

     Karen pushes off, rolls from her right side to her left, brings
     up her Sig Sauer in both hands to put it on them, both standing
     in the opening, in the dark, but right there.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands up and turn around.
                 Now.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite
     directions as she begins firing from the inside...

     As Buddy and Foley hook up again in front of the car.  We can
     see they're beneath an overpass.  Foley stares at the trunk.

                              BUDDY
                 We may as well leave her, we're leaving
                 the car and we gotta leave her some place
                 anyway, what's the difference where?

                              FOLEY
                 She's coming with us.

     Foley walks to the passenger seat, reaches in the window.

                              BUDDY
                 Jesus Christ, what were you doing in
                 there?

                              FOLEY
                 Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd
                 like to know who she is.

     Foley takes her wallet, looks at her driver's licence photo.

                              BUDDY
                 I already looked.  Her name is Karen
                 Sisco.  Like the Cisco Kid only spelled
                 different, S-i-s-c-o.

     A sheriff's green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep
     to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment
     of the overpass.  When the road quiets down, Foley moves to the
     trunk and bangs on it once with his fist.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen?  Be a good girl now, you hear?
                 Now, I'm gonna open the--

     Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're putting holes in your car!

     He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him.
     He settles down, then...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 We're not leaving you.  I'm gonna open
                 the trunk enough for you to throw the
                 gun out.  Okay?  You shoot -- Buddy's
                 got your shotgun, says he'll shoot
                 back if you do and I can't stop him.
                 So it's up to you.

     Foley puts his hand out and Buddy, still looking at him funny,
     gives him the keys.

                              VOICE
                 Hey!

     Coming from somewhere above them.

                              VOICE (CONT'D)
                 It's me, Glenn.

     Foley steps out into the open, Buddy close behind him.  They
     look up to see a figure, head and shoulders against the evening
     sky, leaning on the concrete overpass rail.  We can see his
     long blond hair falling beside his face, now half-concealed
     behind dark sunglasses.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, Jack, good to see you, man.  The
                 fuck're you guys shooting at?

     Foley looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 Do we need him?

                              BUDDY
                 The green-and-whites saw us.  One of
                 'em starts thinking, what's that car
                 doing there?  Ties it to the break and
                 turns around...

     Foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were
                 somebody else.

                              GLENN
                 Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since
                 Lompoc.  What's going on?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, nuthin'.

     Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs
     on the trunk.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You coming out?

     Foley sticks the key in the lock as Buddy steps up to the trunk
     and racks the pump on the shotgun.  Foley leans close to the
     metal.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You hear that?

     He turns the key and raises the lid.  Karen, bunched in there,
     extends her arm, her hand holding the Sig Sauer by the barrel.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     "Jack."  Buddy gives him another funny look.

     EXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT

     As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen
     Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS."

                              FOLEY
                 Have your clothes cleaned and send me
                 the bill.

     Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade,
     move through the scrub.  Glenn leans against the car, flashers
     blinking.

                              KAREN
                 I'll send it to you at Glades.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a
                 sewer?

                              FOLEY
                 Take your sunglasses off.

                              GLENN
                 I see better with them on.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw
                 'em off the overpass while they're
                 still on your head.

     Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Wait in the car.

                              GLENN
                 You're in civilization now, man, ease
                 up.

                              FOLEY
                 I'd like you to go wait in the car.
                 How's that?  Take her with you and put
                 her in back.

                              GLENN
                 In the trunk?

                              FOLEY
                 The backseat.

     Foley stares at him, waiting.  Glenn motions to Karen...

                              GLENN
                 Come on.  I have to do what I'm told.

     She walks past Foley without looking at him.

                              FOLEY
                 Wait a minute.  Let me have your
                 raincoat.
                      (looks at Buddy)
                 Somebody forgot to bring me clean
                 clothes.

                              BUDDY
                 I brought 'em, they're back at Glades
                 in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take
                 her car.

                              KAREN
                 You can blame me if you want.  I don't
                 mind.

     He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds
     it up, then throws it at Foley's feet.

                              GLENN
                 Here you are, sir.

     Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back
     on and takes Karen by the arm.

                              BUDDY
                 What's wrong with you?

     Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the
     backseat.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll
                 never know.

                              BUDDY
                 How 'bout the score was his idea to
                 begin with?

                              FOLEY
                 His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's
                 got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you
                 and me figured the whole thing out.

     Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform,
     all of them caked with muck.

                              BUDDY
                 You're pulling at it.  Here...

     He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard
     shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and
     tearing the shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know why, but every time he
                 opens his mouth I want to punch him
                 out.

                              BUDDY
                 He ain't the problem, Jack.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You wanna pull your head outta your
                 ass and tell me why we're bringing her
                 with us?

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome
     light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door.
     He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs
     his hand through his hair...

                              GLENN
                 ...if he thinks he can talk to me like
                 this.  Shit, I don't even know what I
                 need them for.

     Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against
     the dark foliage.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 I got a big score lined up up north.
                 They wouldn't even know about it, it
                 wasn't for me.  I could do it right
                 now myself, except it's so fucking
                 cold up there in January--

                              KAREN
                 Glenn?

     His head turns so that we can see his designer shades.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You don't remember me, do you?

                              GLENN
                      (beat)
                 It couldn't have been out at Glades,
                 if that's what you're thinking.  I was
                 never out there.

                              KAREN
                 No, that's not what I'm thinking.

     He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face.

                              GLENN
                 But you're sure we've met, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Last fall, I drove you from the Palm
                 Beach county jail to the federal
                 courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn
                 Michaels.
                      (then)
                 I never forget anyone I've cuffed and
                 shackled.

     He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's
     been turned to stone.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if
                 we can work this out...

     He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Do we have a gun in the car?

                              GLENN
                 I remember you now.  Shit.

                              KAREN
                 Foley's not going to make it.  And if
                 he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.

     She touches his shoulder and he jumps.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Look, I can understand if you and Foley
                 are close.

                              GLENN
                 We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--

                              KAREN
                 Wait.  Have you helped him, Glenn?  At
                 this point, technically, I doubt you
                 could be charged with aiding a fugitive.
                 So you still have a choice.  You can
                 help him and risk going down again,
                 get cuffed and shackled, hope to God
                 you pull a reasonable judge, not some
                 hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it
                 another way...

     She pauses.  He turns and looks at her.

                              GLENN
                 Like how?

     EXT. OVERPASS - SAME

     Foley watches a car pass on the highway.

                              BUDDY
                 You want to take her to my place and
                 get cleaned up?  You come out of the
                 bathroom with your after-shave on and
                 she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?

                              FOLEY
                 I want to talk to her again, that's
                 all.  See what would happen under, you
                 know, normal circumstances.

                              BUDDY
                 You're too late, Jack.

     Foley doesn't say anything.  Just takes a deep breath as we
     HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over...

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 He wants to get out of here and I don't
                 blame him.

     They start towards the car.  Then stop and watch as it takes
     off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement.  Their backs
     to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're
     out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word.

     We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER...

     CUT TO: A CORRIDOR IN LOMPOC FPC

     As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named HIMEY
     -- strut purposefully up the hall.  They step into...

     THE PRISON LIBRARY

     Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big
     coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH."

                              MAURICE
                 Dick.  My man.

     Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the
     library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I got your fishies for you.

     He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the
     table.

                              RIPLEY
                      (reaches for them)
                 Thank you...

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls them back)
                 Not so fast, Dick.
                      (off Ripley's look)
                 Starting now, there's gonna be an across
                 the board cost a living increase.

                              RIPLEY
                 What?

                              MAURICE
                 Year ago, I come in here on credit
                 card fraud, but after I shanked that
                 loudmouth pussy on the yard the other
                 day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone
                 way the fuck up.

                              RIPLEY
                 I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.  But
                 then, I could be wrong...

                              MAURICE
                 Whoever.  The point is, prices are
                 goin' up, too.  Better get your little
                 black book out, Richard.  We got some
                 business to talk about.

     Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Let's start with the fish.  They was
                 two grand, but now they's three.

     Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you
                 asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

                              RIPLEY
                      (writing)
                 Well, I need that...

                              MAURICE
                 ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an
                 even three c's.

                              VOICE
                 Hey.

     They all look to where...

     JACK FOLEY

     Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of
     some kind.  Himey gives him a mean stare.  Foley points to a
     sign that says "QUIET PLEASE."

                              FOLEY
                 Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't
                 you guys read?

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 There a problem, Foley?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah.

     Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the
                 dumbest fucking shakedown in the history
                 of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred
                 bucks for a pillow?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              RIPLEY
                 Sounds high, doesn't it?

                              FOLEY
                 Must be a real soft pillow.

                              MAURICE
                 Faux goose down.

                              RIPLEY
                 Still...

                              FOLEY
                 How much for your company at chow?

                              MAURICE
                 Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet.  How much?

                              MAURICE
                 Another C.

     Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this
                 guy to fuck off.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?  Well, I uhhh...

                              FOLEY
                 First of all, if he kills you, he's
                 not gonna get any more money out of
                 you.

     Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point.

                              MAURICE
                 Man doesn't have to get killed.  He
                 could accidentally fall on something
                 sharp, like a shiv.  Or my dick.

     Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.

                              FOLEY
                 You stick anything in this guy, Snoop,
                 they transfer his ass outta here
                 faster'n you can throw a fight, and
                 you still end up with nothing.

     Ripley nods, takes this in.

                              MAURICE
                 This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why
                 don't you go on out to the yard, have
                 yourself a smoke?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't smoke.

                              HIMEY
                      (slowly rising)
                 You heard the man.  Go on outta here.

     Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.

                              MAURICE
                 Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
                 He's ranked number thirty-two in the
                 federal prison system.

                              FOLEY
                      (looking at Himey)
                 Thirty-two outta what, twenty?

     Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock
     Foley in the head when...

     ...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand,
     like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual
     into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending
     his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor
     back-first with a loud thud.

     Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A
     WHISTLE.  They all freeze, look to...

     A PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE

     Who nods towards the door.  We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS,
     takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up,
     covers his now bleeding nose.

                              GUARD
                 What's going on here?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, you know, reading's funnamental
                 an' shit, we just excited.

                              GUARD
                 Clear outta here.

     The guard exits.  Maurice and Foley are still staring at each
     other.

                              RIPLEY
                 Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the
                 fish thing?

                              MAURICE
                      (looks at Foley)
                 Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

     He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into
     Ripley's open hand.  Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a
     fist, crushing the fish.  He taps his fist to Ripley's.

                              RIPLEY
                 That's how you do it.

     Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with
     Himey.  Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at
     Foley.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thanks for your help.

                              FOLEY
                 Any time.

     We hear a PHONE RING and then...

     CUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW)

     As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, fool.  Stick and jab.

     A frisbee whizzes past the television.  We hear A DOG YELP OS.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Hey!  Watch that shit!

     Maurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a
     green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE
     RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                      (calls OS)
                 Tuffy.  C'mere, boy...

                              MAURICE
                 You gonna answer the phone?

                              MOSELLE
                 What for?  It's not for me.

     Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a
     little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's
     head.

                              MOSELLE (CONT'D)
                 Bad dog.

                              MAURICE
                      (scoops up the dog)
                 Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my
                 little Tuffy?

     He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child.

                              MOSELLE
                 I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a
                 Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra
                 money.

     He looks at her.

                              MAURICE
                 That's the dumbest thing I heard in my
                 life.  Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't
                 pay for shit.  You gonna get a gig,
                 it's gotta be for one of the big three:
                 Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit
                 for the fat dogs.  Now answer the fuckin
                 phone.

     She comes over, picks up the phone.

                              MOSELLE
                 Hello?
                      (hands it to Maurice)
                 For you.

                              MAURICE
                      (takes it)
                 This is me.

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - GAS STATION - NIGHT

     An antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone.

                              GLENN
                 Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.

     INTERCUTTING GLENN & MAURICE:

                              MAURICE
                 Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a
                 them psychic friends.  I was just
                 thinkin' about you.

     Glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln
     Town Car and jogs to the john.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to
                 Detroit and need a place to crash.

                              MAURICE
                 You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin
                 one degree outside.

                              GLENN
                 I wanna talk to you about a job.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.

                              GLENN
                 I can't really go into it right now.
                 I'll just tell you it's someone big.

                              MAURICE
                 Someone?  Gimme a hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's a guy you know.

                              MAURICE
                 Gimme another hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's Richard Ripley.

     Maurice doesn't say a word.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 You there?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here.
                 Question is, why aren't you here?

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy hurry up the front steps.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

                              BUDDY
                 Cause she had her hand on her gun the
                 whole time, waiting to make her move.

     Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're just jealous it was me in the
                 trunk with her and not you.

                              BUDDY
                 You're right.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A "hideout."  Not much in the way of furnishings.  Foley follows
     Buddy inside, watches as he bolts the door.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing I'm gonna do is get all
                 this mud off me.

     Foley starts for the bathroom.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I've been dreaming about a hot bath
                 for the last six months.  Soak the prison
                 off me.

                              BUDDY
                 There's some lilac oil, you want some,
                 a vanilla candle under the sink.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, man.

                              BUDDY
                 There's something about a nice hot
                 bath, transforms a person.  It's not
                 just about opening up your pores, know
                 what I mean?  There's just something
                 about the heat and the wet that's
                 calming you know?  Settles me in a way
                 that I really can't articulate.

                              FOLEY
                 I know exactly what you mean.  It's
                 just a feeling.
                      (beat)
                 You know, I could go for some wine
                 tonight.

                              BUDDY
                 There's a store around the corner,
                 I'll be right back.

                              FOLEY
                 Sounds great.

     Foley goes into the bathroom.  A moment later WE HEAR THE BATH
     RUNNING.

     INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

     As Buddy leaves the apartment, starts down the hall, KAREN STEPS
     INTO FRAME, watches as he disappears down the stairs.  Gun drawn,
     she then moves towards the apartment.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     As Foley undresses, picks up a candle off the sink and smells
     it.  He notices his nude image in the mirror and checks himself
     out.

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     As Karen slips the door.  She looks around, HEARS THE WATER
     RUNNING.

     She racks the slide on her gun, snicks off the safety and starts
     for the bathroom.  Suddenly, the water is turned off.  She stops
     where she is.  She then moves a careful step at a time towards
     the open doorway.

     Gradually the tub comes into view, beginning with Foley's feet
     resting crossed on the other end, then the middle of the tub,
     then she's in the doorway, looking down at...

     Foley, lying there in the tub, his eyes closed.  Karen cuts her
     eyes down the length of him, taking a moment here to check him
     out, long enough for Foley to open his eyes and grab her hand,
     the one holding the gun.

                              FOLEY
                 Hey.

     They look at each other a moment.  He then pulls her down to
     him and kisses her.  She kisses him back.  He then pulls her
     into the tub with him as we now hear...

                              MARSHALL SISCO (VO)
                 Karen...?

     CUT TO: KAREN

     As she opens her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 What?

     REVEAL: A HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Flowers everywhere.  Karen -- bruises on her face -- lies in
     bed.  Her father, Marshall, sits on the chair beside her.

                              MARSHALL
                 You were talking in your sleep.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 What'd I say?

                              MARSHALL
                 "Hey, yourself."

                              KAREN
                 Huh.

     We hear A KNOCK at the door.  They look to where Special Agent
     DANIEL BURDON -- black, forties, expensive suit -- stands in
     the doorway, file in one hand.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hello, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                      (to Marshall)
                 Daniel Burdon, FBI.

                              MARSHALL
                 Marshall Sisco.  Karen's dad.

                              BURDON
                 You mind please waiting outside.  We
                 have some business to do here.

     Marshall looks at him a moment.  Then, to Karen...

                              MARSHALL
                 I need to go to the john anyway.

     Burdon waits for Marshall to walk out, then sits down.

                              KAREN
                 I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                 That's nice of you to offer, Karen,
                 but I got all the help I can use right
                 now.  Instead, let's talk about how
                 you got the bump on your head.

                              KAREN
                      (indicates file)
                 Isn't that my report you're holding
                 onto?

                              BURDON
                 Yes, but I want to hear you tell it.
                 Starting with when you tried to grab
                 the wheel -- where was this?

                              KAREN
                 Coming to the Okeechobee exit...

     And now we see it...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars...

                              KAREN
                 Take the next exit.

                              GLENN
                 What am I supposed to do now?

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, take the exit.

                              GLENN
                 No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna
                 turn myself in.

     She reaches over and grabs the wheel.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 The fuck are you doing?!

     He hits the brakes.  The car goes off the road, down the grade,
     the abutment coming right at us as we go back to...

     THE HOSPITAL ROOM

     As Burdon sets the file down, sits back now.

                              KAREN
                 The next thing I knew, the paramedics
                 were taking me out the car.

     Burdon looks at Karen a moment, then...

                              BURDON
                 There's a couple of points I keep
                 wondering about have to do with the
                 two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is
                 it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I
                 swear the man must've robbed two hundred
                 banks in his time.

                              KAREN
                 Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't
                 remember how many he robbed.

                              BURDON
                 You talked to him?

                              KAREN
                 In the trunk, yeah?

                              BURDON
                 What'd you talk about?

                              KAREN
                 Oh... different things, prison, movies.

                              BURDON
                 This fella holds you hostage, you talk
                 about movies?

                              KAREN
                 It was an unusual experience.

                              BURDON
                 Foley made me think of that fella Carl
                 Tillman, the one you were seeing, it
                 turns out the same time he was doing
                 banks.  You recall that?

                              KAREN
                 When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't
                 know he robbed banks.

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe
                 he did, and I told you.  So you had to
                 at least suspect him.

                              KAREN
                 And what happened to Carl?

                              BURDON
                 The time came, you shot him.  But you
                 didn't shoot Foley or the guy with
                 him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
                 and you let them throw you in the trunk.
                 Okay, now you got your Sig in your
                 hand.  You say in the report you
                 couldn't turn around, he had you pinned
                 down.  But when the trunk opened, how
                 come you didn't cap the two guys then?

                              KAREN
                 Is that what you would've done?

                              BURDON
                 You say in the report Glenn didn't
                 have a gun, but you let him get away,
                 too.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel, what do you work on most of
                 the time, fraud?  Go after crooked
                 bookkeepers.

                              BURDON
                 Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen
                 years, on all kinds of investigations.

                              KAREN
                 Have you ever shot a man?  How many
                 times have you been primary through
                 the door?

                              BURDON
                 I have to qualify, is that it?

                              KAREN
                 You have to know what you're talking
                 about.

     We hear CHUCKLING OS.  Burdon glances at the doorway where we
     see Marshall now standing, enjoying this.

                              BURDON
                 We'll talk another time, Karen.  All
                 right?  I'd like to know why Foley put
                 you in that second car when he didn't
                 need you any more.

                              KAREN
                 You'll have to ask him.

                              BURDON
                 Sounds to me like he liked having you
                 around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr.
                 Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Agent Burdon.

     Marshall waits for him to walk out...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 The white man's Burdon.  That's what
                 everybody calls him in Miami.  The
                 Metro-Dade guys.  He's got a knack for
                 pissing people off.

     She's not listening.  He sits down, takes her hand...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 What are you thinking about?

                              KAREN
                 The Sig Sauer you got me for my
                 birthday.

                              MARSHALL
                 Tell you what, you're a good girl, you
                 might get another one for Christmas.

     She looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 I'll get it back when I get Foley.

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     A dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy
     climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm,
     newspaper under the other.  An old woman comes out the door as
     Buddy opens it and squints at him.

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen?

                              BUDDY
                 Uh, no, ma'am.  Sorry.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Buddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream.
     This one's nicer, with a view of the beach.  Jack stands on the
     balcony going through KAREN'S PURSE.

     He pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo.
     He does the same with her gym I.D. card.  He finds her address
     book and opens it up.  A photo of her father slips out.  Jack
     examines it a moment, then flips through the book.

     He stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in
     and comes up with her us Marshal I.D.  He slips it open and
     studies the badge and the picture opposite.

     He holds on to it, looks out at the ocean, but really sees...

     THE OPEN TRUNK OF THE CAR - LAST NIGHT

     As Karen gets out, saying...

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     BACK IN THE APARTMENT

     Foley turns away from the view as Buddy walks in, sets the
     grocery bag down on the coffee table.

                              BUDDY
                 You made the front page.

     He holds up the newspaper so that Foley can see his picture on
     the front page: an unflattering mug shot that doesn't look all
     that much like him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They pass this picture around you can
                 go anywhere you want, nobody'll know
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't feeling my best that day.
                 I'd just drawn thirty to life.

                              BUDDY
                 Maybe this'll make you feel better.

     Buddy reaches into the bag, tosses Foley a NEW ZIPPO.

                              FOLEY
                 Thanks.

     Foley catches the lighter, immediately begins playing with it.
     He looks at the paper on the coffee table as Buddy sits down,
     pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag.

                              BUDDY
                 Paper says there's ten grand each on
                 you, Chino and Lulu.

                              FOLEY
                 Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?

                              BUDDY
                 Just that she got away.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but what happened after she drove
                 off with Glenn?

                              BUDDY
                 You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most
                 likely, he's on his way to Detroit,
                 where we should be.

     Foley walks back out on to the balcony, looks at the contents of
     Karen's bag spread out on the table.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You realize what you're doing?  Worrying
                 about a person that works in law
                 enforcement.  You want to sit down and
                 have cocktails with a girl that tried
                 to shoot you.  You hear what I'm saying?

     Foley holds up the picture of Marshall Sisco.

                              FOLEY
                 Think this old guy is her boyfriend?
                 It's the only picture she carries.

                              BUDDY
                 Am I going to Detroit by myself?

     Foley picks up her drivers licence photo.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Longer we hang around down here, Jack,
                 better chance there is either Glenn's
                 gonna fuck up the whole score, or we
                 gonna get busted, or both.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll leave first thing in the morning.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Right on a marina.  Boats bobbing on the water.

                              MARSHALL (VO)
                 Is this Foley?

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Marshall sits in his chair holding up a newspaper as Karen hands
     him a drink.  She stares at the photograph.

                              KAREN
                 He doesn't even look like that.

                              MARSHALL
                 No?

                              KAREN
                 No, he looks a lot...

     She realizes Marshall's watching her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Different.

     The doorbell RINGS.  She ignores his look, gets up.  Walks to
     the door and opens it to reveal RAY NICOLET, boots, leather
     jacket, etc.  Cowboy Cop.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hi, Ray.

                              RAY
                 You look great.  Your dad taking good
                 care of you?

                              KAREN
                 He took the week off so we'd have time
                 together.  So far he's worked on his
                 boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.

     Marshall gets up, shakes his head.

                              RAY
                 I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Likewise.

                              KAREN
                 Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force,
                 working on the prison break.

                              MARSHALL
                      (eyeing his T-shirt)
                 I see that.

     Ray turns to Karen, holding his jacket open to show the task
     force inscription on his T-shirt in red, the guy's .357 tucked
     into his waistband.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 In case no one knows what he does.
                 Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says,
                 "Undercover"?

                              RAY
                 No.  Course not.

                              KAREN
                      (changing the subject)
                 How's it going?

                              RAY
                 Great.  We got one of 'em.

     Karen looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

                              MARSHALL
                      (before he can answer)
                 Off a tip?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in
                 this hobo camp out by the airport,
                 called the number--

                              MARSHALL
                 I knew it, soon as I saw they were
                 offering a reward.

     She grabs Nicolet by the arm.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

     Marshall looks at her.

                              RAY
                 Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the
                 Cubans.  Linares.

                              KAREN
                 Oh...

                              RAY
                 We went out there, full SWAT, two
                 choppers, the whole bit, but Linares
                 started shooting anyway.  We put him
                 down, but somehow Chirino got away.

                              MARSHALL
                 Did you pay the guy the reward?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, as soon as we got back.

                              KAREN
                 Foley hadn't been there?

     Her father gives her a look.

                              RAY
                 This place was strictly Cuban.  If
                 Foley had a ride he must have his own
                 agenda. He seems to be the only one
                 knows what he's doing.

     THE PHONE RINGS.  Marshall moves to it.

                              MARSHALL
                 Hello?
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.
                      (hands her the phone)
                 For you.

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

     CUT TO: FOLEY ON THE PHONE - DAY

     On the balcony.  Flipping through a copy of Vogue while Buddy
     watches television inside.

                              FOLEY
                 Hi.

     INTERCUTTING KAREN & FOLEY - DAY

     Karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray
     drones on.

                              FOLEY
                 You know who this is?

                              KAREN
                 Yes.

     She walks out to her father's balcony now.

                              FOLEY
                 I just wanted to see if you're okay,
                 make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or,
                 you know, anything.

                              MARSHALL
                 Something I've been wondering, Ray...

     Marshall picks up the newspaper...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 It says in the headline, "I slept with
                 a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."
                 She lives in Little Havana, her
                 husband's out of town working when one
                 of the escapees shows up at her door...

     She closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you get this number?

                              FOLEY
                 Who was it answered the phone?

                              KAREN
                 None of your business.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just worried maybe I'm not old
                 enough for you.

                              KAREN
                 That's my dad.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.  He has a cop's face.

                              KAREN
                 How do you know?  Wait-- you have my
                 wallet.

                              FOLEY
                 And your gun.

                              KAREN
                 Think I could have them back?

                              FOLEY
                 How do we do that?

                              KAREN
                 Let's see.  You could come on by my
                 dad's place, drop 'em off.

                              FOLEY
                 Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the
                 S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.

     Foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's
     been looking for: an ad for Defiance perfume.

                              KAREN
                 There's a guy here on the task force
                 right now.  Maybe I should put him on
                 the phone, let you two work it out.

                              FOLEY
                 You won't do that.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              FOLEY
                 Because you're having too much fun.

     She doesn't know what to say to that.  Foley smells the ad.

     INSIDE THE HOUSE

                              MARSHALL
                 ...She fixes him pork chops and rice,
                 the next thing you know they're making
                 love on the sofa.  She says he was
                 very gentle.

                              RAY
                 I spoke to her.  The guy told her he
                 missed his little girl and she felt
                 sorry for him.

                              MARSHALL
                 That's how you score now?

     ON THE PATIO:

     Karen looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet.

                              KAREN
                 My dad's retired.  He was a Private
                 Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to
                 work for him.

                              FOLEY
                 I can just picture that, a cute girl
                 like you following slip-and-fall and
                 whiplash cheaters.

                              KAREN
                 Something I've been wondering, what
                 ever happened to your Uncle Cully?

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  You think he might tell you where
                 I am?

                              KAREN
                 Unless you wanna tell me.

                              FOLEY
                 He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years
                 before he came out and died not too
                 long after in Charity Hospital, I think
                 trying to make up for all the good
                 times he'd missed.
                      (then)
                 That's not gonna be me.

                              KAREN
                 One last score, that the idea?  Move
                 to some island.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm partial to mountains myself.  But
                 if you like islands, we'll make it an
                 island.

                              KAREN
                 Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?

                              FOLEY
                 I just thought maybe you and me could--

     Buddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles Foley.

                              BUDDY
                 Who you talking to?

                              KAREN
                 Is that Buddy?

     Foley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone.  He looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 What?!

                              BUDDY
                 You better come see this.

     INT. MARSHALL'S CONDO - DAY

     As Karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up,
     opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room.

                              RAY
                 The woman also said he stole her
                 husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol,
                 and some of his clothes.

                              MARSHALL
                 So the woman's married.  She goes to
                 bed with this prison escapee because
                 he misses his little girl and then
                 tells the world about it.  But you
                 don't reveal her name, you protect
                 her.  It sounds like you're saying
                 it's okay as long as her husband doesn't
                 find out about it.  Like the guy who
                 cheats on his wife, saying what she
                 doesn't know won't hurt her.

                              KAREN
                 Dad.

     He looks over at her now.  Gives her an innocent look.

                              MARSHALL
                 What?

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at
     the hobo camp.  We catch a glimpse of RAY NICOLET, GUN IN HIS
     WAISTBAND, STICKING HIS CHEST OUT FOR THE CAMERA.

     Foley shakes his head as they show a shot of Lulu's body covered
     with a sheet.

                              FOLEY
                 Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

                              BUDDY
                 He's running for his life, he doesn't
                 give a shit about you.

                              FOLEY
                 He's gotta know by now that I gave him
                 up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna
                 try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele,
                 see what she knows.

                              BUDDY
                 He knows where she lives?

     Foley doesn't answer.  Buddy mutes the set.  Turns to Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 We were talking one time, drinking
                 rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how
                 she worked for a magician.  Chino got
                 interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How
                 does he saw the woman in half?  He
                 wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at
                 her if she ever came to visit.

                              BUDDY
                 So call her up.  Tell her don't talk
                 to any Cubans.

                              FOLEY
                 Her phone's probably tapped.

                              BUDDY
                 And you know they're gonna have some
                 people watching the hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S BOAT - DAY

     Karen stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints
     the trim on the boat.

                              MARSHALL
                 Remember, pay attention to how she
                 talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it
                 right, she'll tell you things she
                 wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you
                 think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell
                 her about being in the trunk with him,
                 in the dark for half an hour, and see
                 how she takes it.  If she's in on it,
                 what does she get for all the
                 aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I
                 bet nothing.  So she still likes him
                 enough to stick her neck out.  You
                 think that's possible?  What kind of
                 guy is he?

                              KAREN
                 He's pretty laid back, confident.

                              MARSHALL
                 He remind you of that guy, Tillman?

                              KAREN
                 Not at all.

                              MARSHALL
                 But you know he's dirty and you still
                 wanna see him again.

                              KAREN
                 I want to bust his ass, put him in
                 shackles.

                              MARSHALL
                 Maybe.  But you're also curious about
                 the man.  Twice last night you asked
                 your married boyfriend Nicolet about
                 him.  You were concerned, but you didn't
                 want to show it.

                              KAREN
                 My married boyfriend - setting him up
                 with that news story so you could talk
                 about infidelity.  I couldn't believe
                 it.

                              MARSHALL
                 You like the wild ones, don't you?
                 Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You
                 know, I've always said there's a thin
                 line between the cowboy cops and the
                 armed robbers, all those guys that
                 love to pack.

                              KAREN
                 Foley kidnapped me.

                              MARSHALL
                 Yeah, but you talked all the way from
                 GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more
                 like a first date than a kidnapping.
                 
     She gives him a look.  He goes back to his painting.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 Go talk to the ex-wife.

     INT. ADELE DELISI'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass-topped
     dining table and turns on the window air-conditioner when THE
     PHONE RINGS.  She grabs it...

                              ADELE
                 Hi, this is Adele speaking.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - DAY

     Adele's neighbourhood.  Near the beach.  Chino on the phone.  He
     wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit...

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is this Adele?

                              ADELE (PHONE)
                 Yes, it is.

                              CHINO
                 Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.

     He hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in
     one of his pockets.  As he then starts off down the street, we
     can see the name "COLOR MY WORLD HOUSEPAINTING" on the back of
     the jumpsuit.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     Buddy drives.  Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit --
     is beside him.  Buddy looks at him, shakes his head.

                              BUDDY
                 Nice disguise.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm a tourist.

                              BUDDY
                 You at least bring the gun?

                              FOLEY
                      (lifts straw bag)
                 In here with my suntan lotion and beach
                 towel.
                      (points)
                 That's her place.

     As they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front,
     obviously FBI...

                              BUDDY
                 There.  You see the guy sitting on the
                 porch?  The old ladies and one guy?
                 You know they'll have a couple more in
                 a car somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                      (watching something
                       else)
                 Uh-huh...

     Buddy follows Foley's gaze to...

     ACROSS THE STREET

     As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse
     for change.  She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she
     bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh...

                              BUDDY
                 Oh, my.

     Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under
     the car and grab it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you saw her.  That's all you
                 get.

     They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG
     AGENT her ID...

                              FOLEY
                 I guess Adele's in good hands.

                              BUDDY
                 Sure looks that way.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 Let's go to Detroit.

                              BUDDY
                 Now you're talkin'.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the
     narrow opening.

                              ADELE
                 You were both in the trunk?  Together?

                              KAREN
                 From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I
                 left with Glenn.

     Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up,
     heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss.

                              KAREN
                 The FBI didn't tell you I was with
                 them?

                              ADELE
                 They didn't tell me anything, they
                 asked questions.

                              KAREN
                 But you know what I'm talking about,
                 don't you?  About Glenn, don't you,
                 and the second car?

                              ADELE
                 I know a Glenn.

     She thinks a moment.  The door closes and opens again, all the
     way.  Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties,
     but no bra.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'm getting ready to go out.  You can
                 come in if you want, sit down for a
                 minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
                 
                              KAREN
                 No, thanks.

     She comes in, checks out the place.  She turns a chair from the
     glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the
     kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes.

                              ADELE
                 Those are cute shoes.  The kind of
                 jobs I get, I have to wear these killer
                 spikes, they ruin your feet.

     She walks away, comes back with an ashtray.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 When you were in the trunk with Jack...

     Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?

                              KAREN
                 You mean, did he try to jump me?  No,
                 but he was kind of talkative.

                              ADELE
                 He gets that way when he's nervous
                 sometimes.

     Adele sits down at the other end of the table.

                              KAREN
                 You didn't visit him in prison.

                              ADELE
                 He didn't want me to.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              ADELE
                 I don't know.  He was different after
                 he was sentenced, looking at thirty
                 years.  Said it depressed him every
                 time the younger cons called him an
                 old timer.

                              KAREN
                 But you spoke to him on the phone.

                              ADELE
                 He'd call every once in a while.

                              KAREN
                 He called the day he escaped.

                              ADELE
                 He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say
                 about me?  In the trunk?

                              KAREN
                      (beat, lies)
                 He said he wished the two of you could
                 start over, live a normal life.

                              ADELE
                 Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a
                 normal life is robbing banks.  It's
                 all he's ever done.

                              KAREN
                 Did you know that when you married
                 him?

                              ADELE
                 He said he was a card player.  I could
                 live with that.  I never knew he robbed
                 banks till he got busted with that car
                 that caught fire -- if you can imagine
                 something like that happening, comes
                 out of the bank and the car's on fire.
                 I did go see him in jail to tell him I
                 was filing for divorce.  He said,
                 "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.
                      (then)
                 He was fun, but never what you'd call
                 a real husband.

     Adele looks out the window.  Karen waits, looks to an end table
     where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere
     ten years back.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'll say one thing for Jack, he was
                 never ugly or mean, or drank too much.
                 He was very considerate, lights on or
                 off, if you know what I mean.

                              KAREN
                 Really.
                      (looking at the picture)
                 Hm.

     She realizes Adele is looking at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get
                 caught.  I'd like to get him before he
                 does something else, makes it worse on
                 himself.

                              ADELE
                 Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him
                 out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience.
                 Always has been.
                      (chuckles)
                 He tell you how they met?

     Karen shakes her head.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Jack came out of a bank he just robbed
                 in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen
                 car to start.  Battery was dead.  He
                 looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a
                 burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers
                 him a thousand dollars for a jump.
                 Turns out, Buddy was casing the same
                 bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy
                 says, I'll take the thousand, but we're
                 leaving in my car, not that piece of
                 shit you come in.
                      (then)
                 They musta robbed fifty banks together.

                              KAREN
                 Till they got busted.

                              ADELE
                 That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that
                 was on account of Buddy, for some
                 reason, decided to call his sister and
                 confess to a job before they'd done it
                 instead of after.  She called the FBI
                 and they both went down, ended up at
                 Lompoc.
                      (then)
                 I think Buddy felt kinda bad about
                 that.

                              KAREN
                 Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or
                 Glenn?

     Adele looks at Karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick
     raps on the door.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Adele?  You in there?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 I want to speak with you, please.

                              ADELE
                 Who is it?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 I talk to the guy you work for, Emil.
                 He tole me your number and where you
                 live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant
                 and would like to speak to you.

                              ADELE
                 Oh.  Uh-huh.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You did work for Emil, right?

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost
                 four years.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You were his what, his box?

                              ADELE
                 His assistant.

     Karen looks at the door.  Something's wrong... through the glass
     bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement
     on the other side, someone doing something...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 You say you perform in the Miami area?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in
                 Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the
                 Mayishan was my name.

     And now Karen and Adele look at each other.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Can you open the door?

     Karen shakes her head "no."

                              ADELE
                 I'm not dressed.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen to me.
                      (lowers his voice)
                 I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

     Boom.  Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of
     the table, sees Adele staring at her.

                              KAREN
                 Ask him his name.

                              ADELE
                 Who are you?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                      (beat)
                 Jose Chirino.

     Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me
                 Chino.  I'm the same person.

     Karen moves along the table to Adele...

                              KAREN
                      (soft)
                 Tell him to wait in the hall, you have
                 to get dressed.  Say it loud.

     As Adele speaks, Karen racks the slide on her 9mm.

                              ADELE
                 Wait in the hall!  I have to get
                 dressed!

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't
                 bother you no more.

     Karen motions for Adele to keep talking as she takes a position
     beside the door, where we now see Chino's silhouette in one of
     the three glass panels in the centre of the door.

                              ADELE
                 I don't know where he is.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape
                 from prison.  He tole me, I can't find
                 him to see you.  So why don't you open
                 this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can
                 speak.

                              ADELE
                      (staring at Karen)
                 Go away, or I'll call the police.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

     Adele says nothing.  Then...

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you don't want to help me, I'm
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I'm going now.  I see you maybe some
                 time, okay?  Bye bye.

                              KAREN
                      (low)
                 Go in the bedroom and --

     Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes
     through one of the glass panels.  Adele and Karen both jump as
     Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob...

     ...but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight
     as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm
     still sticking through the glass...

     ...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he
     bangs against a wall and falls to the floor.  Dazed, Chino
     reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet.

     Karen brings up her Beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the
     front sight on his chest.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Leave it where it is.

                              CHINO
                      (frowning)
                 Wait.  You not Adele?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I
                 mean, now.

                              CHINO
                 Oh.  Then this must be Adele...

     He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele.

                              KAREN
                 Put it down or I'll shoot.

                              CHINO
                 You wouldn't shoot me, would you?

                              KAREN
                 What do you want to bet?

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 I could walk out of here.

                              KAREN
                 If you move, if you look at her again,
                 you're dead.

     Chino doesn't move.  Keeps his gun on Adele.  Karen starts
     walking towards him...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You can live or die, it's up to you.

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot
                 me?  Nice girl like you?
                      (smiles)
                 I don't think so.

                              KAREN
                 You don't, huh?

     And with that, she kicks him in the knee.  Chino buckles over
     and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 On your knees.

     He does as he's told.  Karen raises his jacket, feels around
     his waist from behind.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Lie face down on the floor.

                              CHINO
                      (hurting)
                 What?!

     She kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there.  She puts
     her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials.  She
     sees Adele staring at her.

                              CHINO (CONT'D)
                      (to Adele)
                 Excuse me...

     Karen looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone...

                              KAREN
                 Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.

                              CHINO
                 Excuse me, Adele?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 You do the sawing of the box in half
                 trick with you inside?

                              ADELE
                      (beat)
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 Tell me, how do you do that?

     Adele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with
     her foot.

                              KAREN
                 Shut up.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying
                 to get a hold of you.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel.  Listen --

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Where are you?  I been trying to reach
                 you.

                              KAREN
                 I'm at Adele Delisi's.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 What-- we already talked to her.  That's
                 a dead end.

                              KAREN
                      (looking at Chino)
                 Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving.
                 Why were you trying to reach me?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around
                 the same time Foley was there.  We got
                 an address for him at the Adams Hotel
                 in Hallandale.  I want you to go there,
                 see if you can get the manager to i.d.
                 him as the other guy.  If he does, you
                 call me right away...

                              KAREN
                 All right, but...

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 But don't you do anything.  You just
                 have a seat, wait for me to get there.

                              KAREN
                 Sure, Daniel.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Now.  What is it you wanted to tell
                 me?

                              KAREN
                 Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to
                 bring in Chirino, would you put me on
                 the task force?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                      (impatient)
                 What?  Is that what you're calling me
                 about?

                              KAREN
                 Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will
                 you let me go after Foley?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in
                 Chirino, you can be on the task
                 force.

                              KAREN
                 That's all I wanted to know.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife
                 and get over to the Adams Hotel.

     Karen hangs up, looks at Adele.  Adele nods.

                              ADELE
                 You're good.

                              KAREN
                 Thank you.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing we do, we get to Detroit,
                 we find Glenn, then we find a window
                 to throw him out of.

                              BUDDY
                 I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was
                 up there to take down the Ripper, where
                 would I go?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, first off, if you were Glenn,
                 you wouldn't be thinking.

                              BUDDY
                 Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal
                 from Lompoc?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be
                 brain dead by now.

                              BUDDY
                 He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told
                 me the Snoop's been managing some guys
                 up there now, works out at the Kronk.

     INT. SHALAMAR APARTMENTS - LOBBY - NIGHT

     The ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters
     with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running
     shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags.
     Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 You get the key?

                              KAREN
                 They're in 7D.

     She hands it to him as they wait for the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 I want two men outside, front and back.
                 Conway and Jessup go on up to seven,
                 cover both ends of the hall.

     Burdon, Karen and the remaining four SWAT team agents.  Burden
     looks at them one at a time.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 You're primary, you're secondary, you're
                 point man.

                              KAREN
                 You're gonna use a ram?

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, why?

                              KAREN
                 The manager's door is metal.

     They all look at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know what I mean?  They might all be.
                 And a ram on a metal door makes an awful
                 lot of noise for what good it does.

     Burdon looks at her, not all that happy she spoke up.  The fourth
     man raises the shotgun, a three-inch strip of metal taped to
     the muzzle.

                              FOURTH MAN
                 I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun
                 oughta do the trick.

                              BURDON
                 Fine.  Whatever.

     He sees the elevator still hasn't come down.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Fuck it.  Let's take the stairs.
                 Karen...

     Burdon pauses, looks at Karen, hands her a radio.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Take the radio, stay down here in the
                 lobby, watch the elevator.

                              KAREN
                 What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.

                              BURDON
                 You can go wait out in the car, you
                 want to.

     She doesn't say anything.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg
                 come in behind us, whatta you do?

                              KAREN
                      (pissed)
                 Call and tell you.

                              BURDON
                 And you let them come up.  You don't
                 try to make the bust yourself.  You
                 understand?

     Before she can answer, an old woman steps in, asks Burdon...

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Are you delivering the oxygen?

     Burdon looks at her, then nods for his men to start up the
     stairs.

     ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY

     Everyone's in position as Burdon eases the key into the lock,
     turns it.  The door won't budge, a dead bolt holds it shut.

     The guy with the shotgun puts the strip of metal against the
     seam, where the lock enters the frame, the muzzle of the shotgun
     exactly three inches now from the dead bolt, and looks over his
     shoulder at Burdon.

     With the sound of the blast, we then...

     CUT TO:  INSIDE THE ELEVATOR - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy ride down with an old lady.  The doors open.
     The woman doesn't move.

                              BUDDY
                 Is this your floor, mother?

                              OLD LADY
                 Oh.  Yes, it is.

     INT. THE LOBBY - SAME TIME - DAY

     As an old gent in a golf cap smiles at Karen sitting there on
     the couch in front of the elevator...

                              OLD GENT
                 Like to play some gin?

                              KAREN
                 No, thank you.

     He creeps off towards the elevator.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Burdon and his men fan out through the place...

     INT. LOBBY - DAY

     As we hear Burdon's voice.

                              BURDON (RADIO)
                 Karen.  They're not up here.  Keep
                 your eyes open.

     Karen looks off towards the street entrance, then back at the
     elevator where the man is still waiting, leaning on his cane.

     The elevator door opens to reveal Buddy and Foley.

                              OLD GENT
                 Going up?

     Buddy and Foley don't answer.  The old man starts to get on,
     feeling with his cane, taking forever.

     Karen and Foley are staring at each other.  He doesn't move.
     Not until the elevator door begins to close.

     Buddy sees Karen, helps the old man aboard as...

     Karen picks up her radio, is about to speak into it when...

     Foley raises his hand.  And waves as the door closes.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     As the elevator resumes going down.

                              OLD GENT
                 Shit, I wanted to go up.

                              BUDDY
                 Let's just hope there's no one in the
                 garage.

                              FOLEY
                 She looked right at me.  She didn't
                 yell or get excited.  She didn't move.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As they get in and Buddy starts the car...

                              BUDDY
                 They know where I live, I guess they
                 know what I drive, so maybe we should
                 pick up another car on the way.

                              FOLEY
                 She just sat there, looking right at
                 me.

     Buddy gives him a look, shakes his head and then burns rubber
     out of the garage as we...

     CUT TO: A CLOSE-UP OF KAREN - DAY

     Staring straight ahead.

                              BURDON (ON THE RADIO)
                 Karen.  Report.  You see anything?
                 Karen?  You there?  Karen...?

     INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

     As Marshall walks Karen to the gate.

                              MARSHALL
                 He waved to you?

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty
                 sure he did.

                              MARSHALL
                 You wave back?

                              KAREN
                 I didn't have time.

                              MARSHALL
                 I imagine you would've though.

     She shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got
                 two calls from Buddy up in Detroit
                 this morning, called Burdon.  She's
                 also the one gave Burdon Buddy's
                 address.

                              MARSHALL
                 So?

                              KAREN
                 So what I want to know is why Buddy
                 still calls his sister every week even
                 after she turned him in.

                              MARSHALL
                 He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
                      (then)
                 What I want to know is why, they got
                 such a big score up north, did Foley
                 hang around Miami for so long?
                      (looks at her)
                 Any thoughts on that one?

                              KAREN
                 None I'd like to share.

     She gives him a kiss...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'll call soon as I get in.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - DETROIT - DAY

     Snow.  Everywhere.  A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the
     neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes.

                              MAURICE (VO)
                 I don't just manage fighters, or deal
                 product any more...

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Glenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka "Snoopy" --
     wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses.

                              MAURICE
                 I've diversified since the last time
                 you saw me.  I've vertically integrated
                 and now I'm into home invasions and
                 the occasional grand larceny.

     Glenn just nods, stares out the window.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my
                 bodyguard when I feel I need one, and
                 my driver.

     Maurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved-
     looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Watch the road, boy.
                      (then)
                 I like this Town Car.  We can cruise
                 the man's neighbourhood without getting
                 the police or private security people
                 on our ass.

                              GLENN
                 Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving
                 around a black guy wearing shades and
                 a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they
                 won't think anything of it.

                              MAURICE
                 It's lilac, man, the color, and the
                 style's made known by Deion and other
                 defensive backs in the pros.  I could
                 be one of them living out here with
                 doctors of my race and basketball
                 players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's
                 house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick
                 wall.  There's his drive, right there.

     The car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming
                 up here, do this themself?

                              GLENN
                 If they're not busted now, they're
                 gonna be.
                      (then)
                 It's wide open.

     EXT./INT. CAR - MAURICE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DETROIT - LATER

     People on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black
     Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and
     snow-covered trash.

                              GLENN
                 So you still haven't said, how you
                 wanna do it?

                              MAURICE
                 I'll show you, soon as I get one more
                 guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother,
                 Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.

                              GLENN
                 What?

     The car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a
     bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always
     seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in.

                              MAURICE
                 You get everything?

     Kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat.  Glenn stares at
     it.  Something about the bag makes him uneasy.  Maybe it's the
     HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Cool.  Kenneth, this is the man I told
                 you about, Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 The one gonna help us rip off the rich
                 guy?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              GLENN
                 Help you...

     White Boy Bob pulls out again.  Glenn looks at the two psychos
     in front, then turns to Maurice.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on
                 this, not all your friends.

                              MAURICE
                 You just ask me how we gonna do it.
                 That's what I'm here for, tell you
                 how.  We the experts.

     Glenn can't believe this is happening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Thing I'm worried about is you.

                              GLENN
                 Me?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah.  If you can step up and actually
                 do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just
                 talking the talk.

                              GLENN
                 Can I do what?

                              MAURICE
                 Walk in a house with me, do this cross-
                 dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I
                 used to sell to been dealin' on his
                 own.

                              GLENN
                 What-- when?

                              MAURICE
                 Right now, son.

                              GLENN
                 I don't have to prove shit to you.
                 The Ripley job is my job.  You're either
                 in or you're not.  You wanna pop some
                 crack dealer pissed you off, that's
                 your problem, not mine.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you
                 don't have to give me no tone of voice,
                 okay?  You don't like what I'm saying,
                 you can get out anywhere along here
                 you want.

                              GLENN
                 I think you're forgetting, this is my
                 car.  I drove it up here.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this
                 car, man, it's mine.  You go get
                 yourself another one.  I say I'm in on
                 Ripley?  I'm in, with or without your
                 ass.  I say I want you to come along
                 on another job, see if you for real or
                 not, guess what you gonna do?

     Glenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We're here.

     Glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit-
     looking two-story house.  Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the
     hack saw and a HAND AXE up to White Boy Bob, a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN
     to Kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go see Eddie.

     Glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear...

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 Must take balls, do what you do.

     EXT. LOMPOC FPC - YARD - DAY

     As Foley walks with Ripley across the yard.

                              RIPLEY
                 Tell me something.  What's it like,
                 walk in a bank with a gun, stick it
                 up?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I never used a gun.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?

                              FOLEY
                 You'd be surprised what all you can
                 get, you ask for it the right way.

                              RIPLEY
                      (smiles)
                 You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep
                 all my money in banks.

                              FOLEY
                 No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?
                      (Ripley smiles)
                 I'm talking about all those uncut
                 diamonds you told Glenn about.

                              RIPLEY
                      (still smiling)
                 I know what you're talking about.

                              FOLEY
                 You're the one with balls, Dick, say
                 something like that to someone like
                 Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where
                 you were for a minute.

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn?
                 I mean, do you believe Glenn?

                              FOLEY
                 Of course not.

                              RIPLEY
                 Plus, even it was true, he'd still
                 have to figure out where I keep 'em.

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You
                 told him you keep 'em at your house.

                              RIPLEY
                      (shrugs, big smile)
                 It's a big house.

     Ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the
     yard.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Tell me something, Jack, how much longer
                 you in here?

                              FOLEY
                 Twenty-two months, three days, two
                 hours.  Why?

                              RIPLEY
                 I was just thinking that I could use a
                 guy like you, someone knows how to ask
                 for things the right way.  I'm talkin'
                 about when you're outta here.  I mean,
                 you can't rob banks for ever.

     Foley looks at Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a little late for me.

                              RIPLEY
                 Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make
                 my first million until I was forty-
                 two.  Forty-two.  You really want to
                 change, it's never too late.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I'm not exactly the
                 nine-to-five type.

                              RIPLEY
                 Who is?  But then you gotta look at a
                 job as more than just work.  You gotta
                 look at it as peace of mind.  As
                 security, you know what I mean?  I got
                 offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston,
                 take your pick.

                              FOLEY
                 My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down
                 there.

                              RIPLEY
                 No need to decide now.  Be like the
                 fish.  Let whatever happens happen.

                              FOLEY
                 The fish?

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, fish live in the present.  They
                 don't dwell on yesterday and they don't
                 worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big
                 fish attacks a little fish, there's no
                 neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward.
                 No whining on some fish-shrink's couch.
                 They just do it.  They accept.

                              FOLEY
                 I can't say that I've paid that much
                 attention to 'em before.

                              RIPLEY
                 The fish saved my life.  Two years
                 ago, I found out I had high blood
                 pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me
                 to go get an aquarium, look at the
                 fish every time I felt myself stressing
                 out.

                              FOLEY
                 And the guy sent you a bill for this?

                              RIPLEY
                 It works.  You should try it sometime.

                              FOLEY
                 The next time I walk into a bank.

     Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...

                              RIPLEY
                 Think about my offer, Jack.

     Foley watches him go.

                              BUDDY (V.O.)
                 Hey, Jack...

     CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF FOLEY

     As he turns to us.

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR

     Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red-
     brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.

                              BUDDY
                 You see this one...

     Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 "Fight over tuna casserole may have
                 spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's
                 live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
                 complained about her tuna noodle
                 casserole and she shot him in the face
                 with a twelve-gauge.  Police found
                 noodles in the woman's hair and think
                 the guy dumped the casserole dish on
                 her before she shot him.  They'd been
                 together ten years.

                              FOLEY
                 Love is funny.

     Buddy looks at him.  Notices something over Foley's shoulder.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey--

     And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car
     pulls into the Kronk parking lot.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

     Kenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the
     front seat.  Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging
     himself, shaking.  Maurice looks out the window...

                              MAURICE
                 Was a time you see a gold Mercedes
                 over in the parking lot has a license
                 plate on it say HITMAN?  You know Tommy
                 Hearns is inside.  Seeing the car would
                 get our juices flowing.

     Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You already got your juices flowing,
                 huh?  Pissed your pants back there at
                 Eddie's house, didn't you?

     Glenn just looks at Maurice.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That was some shit, huh?

                              GLENN
                      (indicates Kenneth)
                 Why'd he have to do that to that girl?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that
                 to that poor girl.

                              KENNETH
                      (smiles)
                 Do what?

     Glenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth.

                              MAURICE
                 Just wait till we get inside Ripley's
                 house.

     And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car.

                              GLENN
                 It's all right with you, I'll just
                 hang in the car.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 No.  You gonna stay close to me from
                 now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

                              GLENN
                 Why would I do that?

     Maurice looks at him, starts laughing.  White Boy Bob and Kenneth
     join in.  Maurice leans over... Glenn flinches as Maurice opens
     Glenn's jacket so that we can see the BLOOD splattered on his T-
     shirt.

                              MAURICE
                 Was worse than you imagined, wasn't
                 it?
                      (then, smiles)
                 Baby, you with the bad boys now.

     INT. FOLEY AND BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the
     car.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you think?

                              FOLEY
                 I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
                 now we got us another partner.

                              BUDDY
                 Or two.

     INT. BOXING GYM - DAY

     Glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring.
     Kenneth grabs a magazine, walks into the john.  A shirtless
     White Boy Bob lifts weights while Maurice moves around the ring
     calling to the boxers inside.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab!

                              VOICE
                 Hey, Studs, how you doing?

     He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing
                 here?

     They sit down on either side of him, close.

                              FOLEY
                 Weren't you expecting us?

                              GLENN
                 That broad you picked up -- did you
                 know she was a US Marshal, for Christ
                 sake?

     Now he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat
     and sits down again.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 She knew me from some bullshit dope
                 bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice.
                 You know what she said, we're in the
                 car on the turnpike?  "I never forget
                 anybody I've cuffed and shackled."

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  She said that to you?

     Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face,
     almost smiling.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 What happened to your shades?  Someone
                 finally step on 'em?

                              GLENN
                      (touches his head)
                 I don't know...

     Foley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 Whose blood you got all over you?

                              GLENN
                 These guys, man, they're crazy.
                      (looks off)
                 Shit.

     Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy
     Bob beside him, carrying his shirts.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo
                 rag?

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now, tell fortunes?

     Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley
     to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We have a problem here?

                              MAURICE
                      (walking over)
                 Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

                              MAURICE
                 It seems to me I been reading about
                 you in the newspaper.  Busted out of
                 some joint in Florida, huh?

                              FOLEY
                 Low class of people there, Snoop.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You call him that again I'll put your
                 head through the wall.

                              BUDDY
                 What?  You mean Snoop?

                              MAURICE
                 Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy,
                 is what White Boy's trying to say.
                 He's a little crude, you understand.
                 No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me.

                              BUDDY
                 But you call this bozo White Boy?

                              GLENN
                 White Boy Bob.
                      (baiting)
                 White Boy used to be a fighter.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now outside of shoot his
                 mouth off?

     White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit.

                              FOLEY
                 Like being back in the yard, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Just like it.  Nobody backing down.
                 You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what
                 you and Buddy doing up here in the
                 cold?

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn didn't tell you?

                              GLENN
                 I thought you guys were busted.

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  Just because you left us standing
                 on the side of the road?

     Foley looks at Glenn.  Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously.  Foley
     smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard.  Now Maurice
     starts laughing.  Buddy, too.  White Boy's lost, looking from
     one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile
     going away as he says...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn
                 promised you or what you think you're
                 gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy
                 get half of whatever we take from
                 Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn
                 cut up the rest is up to you.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go outside and talk.

                              FOLEY
                 What's the matter with right here?
                 It's nice and warm.

                              MAURICE
                 Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees
                 in here, sometimes a hundred -- the
                 way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd
                 sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy
                 Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any
                 business in here.  To me this is holy
                 ground, man.  You understand?  I got
                 to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to
                 talk, come to the fights tomorrow night,
                 we'll sit down and look at it good.
                 The State Theater.

     Foley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll see you tomorrow then.

     Maurice then watches as they walk out.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, how much is the reward on
                 the man again?

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Ten gees.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.
                      (then)
                 You recall, did it say dead or alive?

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier.
     Now it's a CRIME SCENE.  A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers
     stand just behind the yellow tape.  A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up
     the front yard.

     Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly-
     freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control.

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Ray Cruz.

                              COP
                 He's inside.
                      (pissed)
                 With everybody else.

     Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk.  She pauses
     to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD
     BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window.

     INT. HOUSE - SAME

     Hell.  Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in
     the doorway.  Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A
     MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the
     chest.  He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist.

     Congealed blood runs down the stairs.  COPS and CRIME SCENE
     TECHS are everywhere.  Karen looks at the guy on the stairs.

                              VOICE
                 Called themselves the Youngboys.

     Karen looks over as RAYMOND CRUZ, a stocky, genial-looking
     detective comes out of the kitchen.

                              CRUZ
                 Ironic, isn't it?

                              KAREN
                 How are you, Raymond?

                              CRUZ
                 Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.

     He kisses her on the cheek.  She indicates the body by the door.

                              KAREN
                 Quite a mess.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked
                 Eddie.

                              KAREN
                 Who?

                              CRUZ
                 Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon,
                 used to buy scag off a corner till he
                 kicked it and found his happiness with
                 crack and then started dealing himself.
                 Word on the street was he was saving
                 up for an operation.

                              KAREN
                 What is it with crack and transsexuals?

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had
                 these girls cooked the rocks he called
                 the Rockettes.

                              KAREN
                 Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.

                              CRUZ
                 Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped
                 her, shot her, then threw her out the
                 window.
                      (shakes his head)
                 Fuckin' animals.

     This shuts them both up.  Cruz indicates the door.

                              CRUZ (CONT'D)
                 Let's get some air.

     She starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on
     the ground...

     A BROKEN PAIR OF SUNGLASSES

     Wrap-around... a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing.
     Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out.

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     As Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press
     photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene.

                              CRUZ
                 Other than we had so much fun the last
                 time we worked together.  You gonna
                 tell me why you're comin' to me instead
                 of the FBI?

                              KAREN
                 I report to the FBI, first thing they're
                 gonna do is ask me to go get some
                 coffee.

                              CRUZ
                 You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

                              KAREN
                 No, I didn't know that.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and
                 property now, also sex crimes and child
                 abuse.

                              KAREN
                 Detroit, you must be pretty busy.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions
                 are big, too.

                              KAREN
                 Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had
                 this guy Glenn Michaels on possession
                 with intent but couldn't make it stick.
                 In his statement, Glenn said he went
                 up to Detroit to visit a friend and
                 look into job opportunities -- if you
                 can believe that.

                              CRUZ
                 Who was the friend?

                              KAREN
                 Guy named Maurice Miller, also known
                 as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.

                              CRUZ
                 Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a
                 fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray
                 Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other
                 Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.

                              KAREN
                 I'll need a last known address.

                              CRUZ
                 That's fine, but I don't want you to
                 talk to Miller alone.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer,
                 I'm armed.

     He turns and looks at her.

                              CRUZ
                 Yes, you are.  I'll call you tomorrow
                 with the address.

     As he gets into his car, we then:

     CUT TO: A NEWSPAPER

     The crime scene from the night before.  A shot of Karen and Ray
     Cruz as they exit the house.  A headline reads "TRIPLE MURDER"
     blah-blah-blah...

                              BUDDY (PHONE)
                 You have the paper?

     REVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the
     newspaper photograph of Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a terrific shot of her.

     INT. BUDDY'S ROOM - SAME

     Buddy looking at the same shot...

                              BUDDY
                 Outside of that.

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & BUDDY

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't say what she's doing up here,
                 but I don't think it has anything to
                 do with us.

                              BUDDY
                 She came up here on her vacation, 'cause
                 she likes shitty weather.

     Foley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center
     and pulls out a tie.

                              FOLEY
                 I think she's after Glenn.  The girl
                 still with you?

                              BUDDY
                 They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less
                 you pay for it.

                              FOLEY
                 You tell your sister about it?

                              BUDDY
                 Just hung up.

                              FOLEY
                 How long you talk to her?

                              BUDDY
                 Two hours.

                              FOLEY
                 How long were you with the girl?

                              BUDDY
                 Forty-five minutes.

                              FOLEY
                 You didn't tell your sister about
                 Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna
                 go through that again.

                              BUDDY
                 Forget about my sister.  If Karen
                 Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked.
                 Tomorrow night at the fights we all
                 get picked up.

                              FOLEY
                 Let's drive by where we're meeting and
                 have a look.  Maybe take a look at
                 Ripley's place while we're at it.

     Foley hangs up.  He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie.

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 I guess next time I see you, you'll be
                 wearing a suit and tie...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - DAY

     Foley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a
     jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of A GUARD, gathers up
     his belongings.  He's going home.

                              FOLEY
                 I still haven't made up my mind yet.

                              RIPLEY
                 What's to think about?

                              FOLEY
                 You goin' right back to work?

                              RIPLEY
                 First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year,
                 study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz...
                 then come back, maybe take some tennis
                 lessons.

     He tears a picture off the wall...

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here...
                      (hands it to Foley)
                 Something to remember me by.

     Foley stares at the photograph of sea life.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 It's not the real thing, but it's still
                 nice to look at.

     Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 See you on the outside, Jack.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in
     the overall effect.

                              FOLEY
                      (smiles)
                 Hi!  I just broke outta jail!

     His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at
     the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside,
     grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone...

                              VOICE (PHONE)
                 Atheneum Hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen Sisco, please.

                              VOICE
                      (pause, then)
                 I'm sorry, but there's no one by that
                 name registered.

                              FOLEY
                 Thank you.

     He dials the next number...

                              VOICE
                 Best Western...

     EXT. MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Red brick, showing its age.  Karen rings the doorbell and then
     waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy
     coat.  The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe
     holding her arms close against the cold.

                              KAREN
                 Moselle Miller?

                              MOSELLE
                 What do you want?

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 You find him, tell him the dog got run
                 over and I'm out of grocery money.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Moselle.  Who you talking to?

                              MOSELLE
                 Lady looking for Maurice.

                              MALE VOICE
                 What's she want?

                              MOSELLE
                 Hasn't said.

                              KAREN
                 That's not Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's
                 talking on the phone.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Ask what she want with him?

                              MOSELLE
                 You ask her.  Maurice's business is
                 none of my business.

     Sounding tired or bored.  She turns from the door and walks
     into the living room.  Karen steps inside, pushes the door
     closed and steps into the foyer.

                              MALE VOICE
                 How do I know?

     Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and
     sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on
     the phone...

                              KENNETH
                 The State, huh.  Who's fighting?

     Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa
     lighting a cigarette.

                              MOSELLE
                 You like to sit down?

                              KAREN
                 Thanks.

     Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray
     daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the
     fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm looking for a friend of mine I think
                 Maurice knows.

                              MOSELLE
                 You not with probation, one of those?

                              KAREN
                 No.

                              MOSELLE
                 You a lawyer?

                              KAREN
                      (smiles)
                 No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him.
                 Glenn Michaels?

     Moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke.

                              MOSELLE
                 Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed here last November.

                              MOSELLE
                 Here?  In this house?

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed with Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 Well, he ain't even here that much.  I
                 like to know where he goes, but at the
                 same time I don't want to know, you
                 understand?

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Your dog was killed?

                              MOSELLE
                 Got run over by a car.

                              KAREN
                 What did you call it?

     Moselle looks at the couch, where a MANGLED FRISBEE sits.

                              MOSELLE
                 Was a she, name Tuffy.

                              KAREN
                      (nods, then)
                 Where do you think I might find Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 I don't know -- the gym, the fights.
                 I know he don't miss the fights.  Having
                 some tomorrow night at the State
                 Theater.  He use to take me.

                              KAREN
                 The State Theater?

                              VOICE
                 What you want with Maurice?

     Karen turns, sees Kenneth standing in the arched entrance from
     the foyer.

                              MOSELLE
                 She looking for a man name of Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 Did I ask you?  Go on out of here.  Do
                 something with yourself.

     He waits until Moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away
     from them through the dining room.  Karen watches him come toward
     her now in kind of an easy strut.  She indicates the scar over
     his eye...

                              KAREN
                 You're a fighter?

                              KENNETH
                 How you know that?

                              KAREN
                 I can tell.

                              KENNETH
                 I was...

     He moves his head in what might be a feint.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Till I got my retina detached two time.

     He's standing so close to her, Karen has to look up at him.

                              KAREN
                 What'd you fight, middleweight?

                              KENNETH
                 Light to super-middleweight, as my
                 body developed.  You go about what,
                 bantam?

                              KAREN
                 Flyweight.

                              KENNETH
                 You know your divisions.  You like the
                 fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah,
                 I bet you do.
                      (moves closer)
                 Like to get down and tussle a little
                 bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she
                 got run over, we use to get down on
                 the floor and tussle.  I say to her,
                 "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat
                 for you."  And I give Tuffy what every
                 dog love best.  You know what that is?
                 A bone.
                      (real close)
                 I can give you a bone, too, girl.

                              KAREN
                 You're not my type.

                              KENNETH
                 Don't matter.  I let the monster out,
                 you gonna do what it wants.

                              KAREN
                 Just a minute.

     Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.

                              KENNETH
                 Bring your own rubbers with you?

     Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip
     on a golf club.  Kenneth grins at her...

                              KENNETHN (CONT'D)
                 What else you have in there, mace?
                 Have a whistle, different kinds of
                 female-protection shit?

     Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face.

                              KAREN
                 I have to go, Kenneth.

     She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's
     like a golf club grip.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?

     She steps aside and brushes past him.  He grabs her left wrist...

                              KENNETH
                 We gonna tussle first.

     Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots
     out of the grip.  She pulls an arm's length away from him and
     chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking
     away...

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 God damn...

     He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that
     when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of
     his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 What's wrong with you?

                              KAREN
                 You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

     And she walks out.  She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer.
     Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and
     comes out with a business card.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wrote my hotel number on there -- in
                 case you run into Glenn.

     Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.  Karen smiles
     at her and walks out the door.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - DAY

     It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     Buddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see
     the house.

                              BUDDY
                 Now that's a really big house.

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost
                 looks like a prison.

                              BUDDY
                 No doubt the man's got some big-ass
                 security system.

                              FOLEY
                 Time comes, we knock on the door.  See
                 if he wants to talk about old times.
                 Go in the easy way.

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we
                 got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole
                 with us?

                              FOLEY
                 Who says anybody's gonna be with us?
                 I say we go to the fights tomorrow,
                 find out what the Snoop's big plan is,
                 then go in ahead of those guys --
                 alone.

                              BUDDY
                 Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while
                 we're off livin' the good life.

                              FOLEY
                 Tell me something, Buddy.  You know
                 anyone who's actually done one last
                 big score and gone to live the good
                 life?  Cause it occurred to me that
                 everyone talks about doing it, but I
                 don't know anyone who's actually gone
                 and done it.  Do you?

                              BUDDY
                      (beat)
                 What about that D.B. Cooper guy?

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I mean, they don't know for sure he's
                 dead.
                      (then)
                 Look, there's always a chance we'll
                 walk out've there with nothing.  I say
                 let fate decide.

                              FOLEY
                 Let fate decide?  What're you, the
                 fuckin' Dali Lama now?

                              BUDDY
                 My sister believes in fate, but not
                 hell.  That's why she stopped praying
                 for the lost souls since you don't
                 hear that much about purgatory anymore.
                 But every day she asks her boss to
                 pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think,
                 you think there's a hell, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional
                 Institution and I'm sure as shit not
                 going back there or any place like it.

                              BUDDY
                 You might not have a choice.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They put a gun on you, you'll go back.

                              FOLEY
                 They put a gun on you, you still have
                 a choice, don't you?

     Foley turns back to the house.  And now we hear...

                              MR. HEARN (VO)
                 I think you're gonna fit right in...

     INT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY

     The personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a
     grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty
     suit and tie.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long
                 discussion about your role in the
                 company and it was his feeling that
                 you would be happiest working down
                 here in Miami.  How's that sound to
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 Great.

     Mr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley...

                              MR. HEARN
                 You're about a 42 long, right?

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     But Mr. Hearn walks out without answering.  Foley looks at the
     desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the-
     bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar.

     Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with
     it.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Okay.  Let's see how she fits.

     Foley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what
     looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm.

                              FOLEY
                 What is this?

                              MR. HEARN
                 Your uniform.

                              FOLEY
                 My what?

     Mr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one
     arm.  Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Are you kidding me?

     RICHARD RIPLEY'S OFFICE

     View.  Wet bar.  Huge fucking aquarium.

                              RECEPTIONIST (OS)
                 Sir, you can't go in there...

     Ripley looks up from his desk as Foley steps in, the receptionist
     right behind him now.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack?  Whoa-- what's the problem?
                 Take it easy, let's talk...

     Meanwhile, Ripley pushes a PANIC BUTTON beneath his desk...

                              FOLEY
                 A security guard?  Are you fucking
                 kidding me?

     Ripley considers Foley a moment, then...

                              RIPLEY
                 You know, I wasn't sure you'd show up.
                 But I was pretty sure that, if you
                 did, you'd throw the job in my face.
                      (then)
                 Understand something, Jack.  Up to
                 this point, everything you've done
                 with your life means absolutely nothing
                 in the real world.  Less than nothing.

     Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're a bank robber.  This is not a
                 marketable skill.  There are no old
                 bank robbers out in the world living
                 on pensions.  You know this.  That's
                 why you're here right now.
                 
     Still Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at
                 a lousy wage.  You think you're better
                 than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me
                 that you're really willing to change
                 and we'll talk about something better.
                 A lot better.  But first, Jack, you
                 gotta earn it.

                              FOLEY
                 How, Dick?  The way you earned it?  By
                 marrying some rich broad owns the
                 company, selling it off a piece at a
                 time, then divorcing her?  What is
                 this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by
                 the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in
                 prison, guy like you, place like that,
                 you were ice cream for freaks.  You
                 were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and
                 a dozen other guys coulda bled you
                 till you had nothing.  Till you were
                 nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll
                 pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a
                 fuckin stool all day saying "sign in
                 here please" or "hey, pal, you can't
                 park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do
                 it.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I
                 misjudged you.

     Two massive SECURITY GUARDS appear in the doorway...

                              FOLEY
                 Hey, what job he promise you guys?

                              GUARD
                 There's two ways we can do this.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  What are they?

                              RIPLEY
                 Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down
                 now.  Haven't we, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally
                 "relaxed..."

     And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH) and wings
     it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S BUILDING - FLORIDA - DAY

     As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two
     guards.  He picks himself up.  He kicks at the guards, who wave
     him off, go back inside.

     Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees...

     THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     The one from the opening.  Foley looks at it a moment, then
     calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he
     starts across the street...

                                                             CUT TO:

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As Buddy pulls away from the house, Foley pulls out the clipping of
     Karen he tore out of the morning paper.  He's written the name 
     "WESTIN" on it.

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, I gotta get some better shoes,
                 few other things before tomorrow.  Why
                 don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen,
                 we'll hook up later?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, and I better call my sister.

     CUT TO: THE SNOWSTORM

     It's really coming down.  We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're
     looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of
     the Westin.

     A table of three young EXECUTIVE-LOOKING GUYS in suits are
     laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a WAITRESS to
     an adjacent table.

                              KAREN
                 Jack Daniel's, please, water on the
                 side.

     She turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast
     sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above
     the city, down there somewhere.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY'S VOICE
                 Celeste, do us again, please, and put
                 the lady's drink on our bill.

     She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling,
     pleasant-looking guys in dark suits.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks anyway.

                              WAITRESS
                      (drifting over)
                 They want to buy you a drink.

                              KAREN
                 I get that.  Tell them I'd rather pay
                 for my own.

     She then watches the three guys looking at the waitress
     delivering the message.  Then they look at Karen.  She gives
     them a shrug, turns to watch the snow.  Her drink arrives.  She
     takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over...

                              EXECUTIVE GUY
                 Excuse me.  My associates and I made a
                 bet on what you do for a living.

     She glances at the table, the other two watching.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY (CONT'D)
                 And I won.  Hi, I'm Philip.

                              KAREN
                 If it's okay with you, Philip, I'd
                 like to just have a quiet drink and
                 leave.  Okay?

                              PHILIP
                 Don't you want to know what I guessed?
                 How I know what you do for a living?

                              KAREN
                 Tell you the truth, I'm not even mildly
                 curious.  Really, I don't want to be
                 rude, Philip, I'd just like to be left
                 alone.

     She turns back to the snowstorm.  She sees his reflection turn
     and leave.  A moment later, the next one appears at the table.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2
                 I think I know why you're depressed --
                 if I may offer an observation.

     She just looks at him.  So sure of himself.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2 (CONT'D)
                 I have a hunch you're the new sales
                 rep and your customer isn't exactly
                 knocked out by the idea of a young
                 lady, even one as stunning as you,
                 handling the account.  Am I close?
                 Hi, I'm Andy.

     She says nothing to him.

                              ANDY
                 We're ad guys.  We flew in from New
                 York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker
                 Distillery, present this test-market
                 campaign for their new margarita mix.
                 What we do, we show this guy who looks
                 like a Mexican bandido, you know, with
                 the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts--

                              KAREN
                 Andy?  Really.  Who gives a shit?

     He gives her a sympathetic expression.

                              ANDY
                 Want to tell me what happened?

                              KAREN
                 Beat it, will you?

     She stares at the guy until he turns away.  She sips her drink,
     stares once more out at the blizzard.  After a few moments,
     another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.

                              VOICE
                 Can I buy you a drink?

     Boom.  Not one of the executive guys.  She stares at the
     reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK
     FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, I'd love one.
                      (then)
                 Would you like to sit down?

     He pulls the chair out, looking at her.  The three guys at the
     other table now staring as he sits down.  Foley offers his
     hand...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm Gary.

     She hesitates, then shakes his hand...

                              KAREN
                 I'm Celeste.

     She smiles with him.  When she lowers her hand to the table,
     his hand comes down to cover hers.  She watches his expression
     as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers,
     and lays her hand on his.  The tips of her fingers brush his
     knuckles, lightly back and forth.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It takes hours to get a drink around
                 here.  There's only one waitress.

                              FOLEY
                 I can go to the bar.

                              KAREN
                 Don't leave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Those guys bother you?

                              KAREN
                 No, they're all right.  I meant, you
                 just got here.

     She picks up her drink and places it in front of him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Help yourself.

     She watches him take a sip, smack his lips.

                              FOLEY
                 You like bourbon?

                              KAREN
                 Love it.

                              FOLEY
                      (passes the glass
                       back)
                 Well, we got that out of the way.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for
                 a living?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call
                 on a customer and they gave me a hard
                 time because I'm a girl.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that how you think of yourself?

                              KAREN
                 What, as a sales rep?

                              FOLEY
                 A girl.

                              KAREN
                 I don't have a problem with it.

                              FOLEY
                 I like your hair.  And that suit.

                              KAREN
                 I had one just like it -- well, it was
                 the same idea, but I had to get rid of
                 it.

                              FOLEY
                 You did?

                              KAREN
                 It smelled.

                              FOLEY
                 Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?

                              KAREN
                 No.
                      (then)
                 What do you do for a living, Gary?

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 How far do we go with this?

     This stops her, throws her off balance.

                              KAREN
                 Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think it works if we're somebody
                 else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and
                 Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about
                 anything?

                              KAREN
                 It's your game.  I've never played
                 this before.

                              FOLEY
                 It's not a game.  Something you play.

                              KAREN
                 Well, does it make sense to you?

                              FOLEY
                 It doesn't have to, it's something
                 that happens.  It's like seeing a person
                 you never saw before -- you could be
                 passing on the street -- you look at
                 each other and for a few seconds,
                 there's a kind of recognition.  Like
                 you both know something.  But then the
                 next moment the person's gone, and
                 it's too late to do anything about it,
                 but you remember it because it was
                 right there and you let it go, and you
                 think, "What if I had stopped and said
                 something?"  It might happen only a
                 few times in your life.

                              KAREN
                 Or once.

     They look at each other a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 Why don't we get out of here.

     They both get up.  The ad guys at the table watch as she follows
     Foley to the elevator.  Karen winks at them.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     As they ride down to Karen's room.  She looks at him, looks
     away.  The doors open and they exit.

     INT. HER HOTEL SUITE

     As he follows her in.  She walks to the bar, fixes them each a
     drink.  He checks out the room, takes in her view.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you find me?

     He comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her
     picture and shows it to her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Oh, God...

                              FOLEY
                 I called your room from downstairs.

                              KAREN
                 If I had answered, what were you gonna
                 say?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, I'd say who I was and do you
                 remember me and ask if you'd like to
                 meet for a drink.

                              KAREN
                 If I remembered you.  I came looking
                 for you.  I would've said sure, let's
                 do it.  But for all you knew I could
                 show up with a SWAT team.  Why would
                 you trust me?

                              FOLEY
                 It would be worth the risk.

     She looks at him, touches his face with her hand...

                              KAREN
                 You like taking risks.

                              FOLEY
                 So do you.

     He kisses her now, puts his arms around her.

                              KAREN
                 What's the hurry, Jack?  You have to
                 be somewhere?

     She hands him his drink.  They both drink, then...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Sooner or later...

     She stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You really wear that suit.

                              FOLEY
                 That's not what you were about to say.

     She shrugs, lets it go.  He puts down his drink, kisses her.
     She lets him, then moves to the couch.

                              KAREN
                 Remember how talkative you were?  In
                 the trunk?  Adele said you do that
                 when you're nervous.

                              FOLEY
                 She did, huh.

                              KAREN
                 You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but in a nice way.

     He sits down and they kiss again.  This time she peels his jacket
     off.  He does the same with hers.  He's starting to unbutton
     her blouse when--

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                      (unbuttoning)
                 I might've smelled like a sewer, but
                 you could tell I was a gentleman.
                 They say John Dillinger was a pretty
                 nice guy.

                              KAREN
                 He killed a police officer.

     He stops.  Looks at her.

                              FOLEY
                 I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop
                 fell as Dillinger was aiming at his
                 leg and got him through the heart.

                              KAREN
                 You believe that?

                              FOLEY
                 Why not?

     She looks at him, decides to get off this subject.  Anyway he's
     finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands
     inside her shirt.  She closes her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 You know that Sig .380 you took was my
                 favourite.  My father gave it to me.

     As he kisses her on the neck.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 What were you gonna do with me?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I hadn't worked that
                 part out yet.  All I knew was that I
                 liked you, and I didn't want to leave
                 you there, never see you again.

                              KAREN
                 You waved to me in the elevator.

     She's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't sure you caught that.

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking
                 of you by then, a lot, wondering what
                 it would be like if we did meet.  Like
                 if we could take a time-out...

                              FOLEY
                 Really?  I was thinking the same thing.
                 If we could call time and get together
                 for a while.

     They look at each other a moment.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You know I saw you on the street.

                              KAREN
                 Where?

                              FOLEY
                 Outside Adele's.

     He starts to kiss her again, but--

                              KAREN
                 You were going to see her?

                              FOLEY
                 To warn her about Chino.

                              KAREN
                 So she did help you?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think we should get into that.

                              KAREN
                 No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't
                 ask if he's with you or what you're
                 doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've
                 run into Glenn Michaels yet.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare
                 me.

     And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.

                              KAREN
                 Come on.

     He gets up and she leads him across the room...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to
     take off his pants.

                              KAREN
                 Are you gonna leave your tie on?

     He looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she
     gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him,
     standing close to help him with the tie...

                              FOLEY
                 My God, look at you.

     When her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck
     again and then as she turns off the light...

     She kisses him.  He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with
     him, the only light now coming from the sitting room.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You having fun?

     She smiles and then they start to make love as we then...

     FADE OUT.

     CUT TO: KAREN

     Eyes open, serious now.

     REVEAL

     She's lying in Jack's arms.  She looks at him a moment, then
     moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.

                              FOLEY
                 You coming back?

                              KAREN
                 I'm just going to the bathroom.

     She gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the
     door.  Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     She comes in.  Looks at herself in the mirror.  Suddenly
     feels self-conscious.  She grabs a bathrobe off the door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the
     ceiling.  She comes out again and stands looking down at him.

                              KAREN
                 I want you to know something.  I wasn't
                 looking for just a fuck, if that's
                 what you're thinking.

                              FOLEY
                 Why are you mad?

                              KAREN
                 Or I did it for some kind of kinky
                 thrill.  Score with a bank robber the
                 way some women go for rough trade.

                              FOLEY
                 What about my motive?  Now I can say I
                 fucked a US Marshal.  You think I
                 will?

                              KAREN
                 I don't know.

     He raises the covers, but she just stands there.

                              FOLEY
                 I know of a guy he goes in the bank
                 holding a bottle he says is
                 nitroglycerin.  He scores some cash
                 off a teller, he's on his way out when
                 he drops the bottle.  It shatters on
                 the tile floor, he slips in the stuff,
                 cracks his head and they've got him.
                 The nitro was canola oil.  I know more
                 fucked-up bank robbers than ones that
                 know what they're doing.  I doubt one
                 in ten can tell a dye pack when he
                 sees one.  Most bank robbers are fucking
                 morons.  To go to bed with a bank robber
                 for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd
                 have to be as dumb as they are.  I
                 know you're not dumb, so why would I
                 think that?  Why would you think I
                 might think that?

     She comes over and sits down on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 You're not dumb.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know about that.  You can't do
                 three falls and think you have much of
                 a brain.

     They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him.  He senses
     this, looks at her...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You getting serious on me now?

                              KAREN
                 I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know
                 what's gonna happen.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 You know.

     And he kisses her.

     EXT. DETROIT - DAY

     The sun is out.  The snow has stopped falling.  A white blanket
     covers everything.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

     Karen opens her eyes, wakes up.  She closes them again, lies
     on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.  Then...

                              KAREN
                 Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.

     She opens her eyes and rolls on to her back.  She turns her head:
     Foley's gone.  She gets out of bed.

     INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Karen comes into the room tying her robe.  She looks at the
     coffee table where...

     Something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and
     the ice bucket.  She picks it up and slowly unfolds the "gift"
     from Foley:  Her Sig-Sauer .38.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his
     underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room-
     service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by.

                              BUDDY
                 It took you, what, seven hours to buy
                 a pair of shoes?

                              FOLEY
                 I saw Karen Sisco.

     Buddy turns to him.

                              BUDDY
                 And she saw you?

                              FOLEY
                 Yes, she did.

                              BUDDY
                 So how's that work, a wanted felon
                 socializing with a U.S. Marshal?

                              FOLEY
                 You know how I felt about her.

                              BUDDY
                 Did you give her a jump?  If you did I
                 might begin to understand where your
                 head's at.

                              FOLEY
                 It wasn't about getting laid.  I just
                 wanted to know what might've happened
                 if things were different.

                              BUDDY
                 You find out?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I did.

     Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee.

                              BUDDY
                 So what's that mean?  That you're
                 disappointed by what you found or you're
                 sorry you robbed all those banks?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of
     glasses.  She reaches for the phone, dials.  A moment later, we
     hear MARSHALL SISCO'S ANSWERING MACHINE and she hangs up.

     INT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT

     A ring set up on stage.  Men hang out on the side.  Where movie
     seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of
     them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through
     the theatre to the bar.  Rap music booms out of speakers as
     fighters are announced.

     Everyone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob
     who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude
     black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along
     the apron of the stage.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, stick and jab!

     White Boy Bob throws down a beer and gives Glenn's shoulder a jab.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You drink like a girl.

     White Boy looks around to see if there are any other morons
     sitting nearby who think it's funny.  Kenneth comes through for
     his pal and laughs.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     As Karen walks through the bar, pauses as she sees Glenn sitting
     with White Boy and Kenneth.  She steps back into the shadows as
     Glenn glances anxiously about.

     ON GLENN

     As he pushes his chair back.

                              GLENN
                 I got to go take a piss.

     He hesitates, sees the car keys on the table in front of White
     Boy Bob.  But before he can grab them...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 What're you telling us for?  You want
                 somebody to hold your little pecker?

     Glenn gets up, sees his coat on the back of the chair, but knows
     he can't take it with him.  He walks away from the table.

     EXT. STATE THEATER - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

     Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot.
     Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME TIME

     Glenn behind the wheel, half lying on his right side as he tries
     to rip open the locked glove compartment.  His head jerks around
     as Karen opens the door.  He sits up straight as she gets in
     with him.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, are you trying to steal this
                 car?

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, I don't believe it.

                              KAREN
                 Another one of those days, huh, nothing
                 seems to go right?

     He raises his empty hands.

                              GLEN
                 I don't have the keys.

                              KAREN
                 I see that.

                              GLENN
                 I mean I'm not stealing the fucking
                 car.

                              KAREN
                 You're not?

                              GLENN
                 I already stole it.  Last week or
                 whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't
                 be stealing it again, can I?

                              KAREN
                 The two guys you were with -- that
                 one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it?
                 I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that
                 didn't look like him.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?

     Karen looks at him, shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, I know your life history, who
                 your friends are, where you've been
                 and now, it looks like, where you're
                 going.  Put your hands on the wheel.

                              GLENN
                 You're gonna bust me for picking up a
                 car?

                              KAREN
                 For the car, for aiding and abetting a
                 prison escape, and conspiring to do
                 whatever you came here for.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, these guys, they're gonna be
                 out here any minute looking for me.
                 They're fucking animals.

                              KAREN
                 What's going on, Glenn?

                              GLENN
                 Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck
                 outta here.

                              KAREN
                 But I thought the whole thing was your
                 idea?

                              GLENN
                 Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but
                 these guys, man, they're into shit I
                 can't handle.

                              KAREN
                 Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?

                              GLENN
                 Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at
                 his office tomorrow, take him out to
                 his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I
                 don't give a shit what they do.

                              KAREN
                 And is Foley a part of this?

                              GLENN
                 He's supposed to be, but he hasn't
                 shown up yet, which is a good thing
                 for him.

                              KAREN
                 Why's that?

                              GLENN
                 Maurice is gonna kill him, try and
                 collect the reward.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 But you say he hasn't shown up, you
                 think he backed out?

                              GLENN
                 I don't know-- he doesn't exactly
                 confide in me.

                              KAREN
                 Gee, I wonder why not.

                              GLENN
                 I'm freezing my ass off.

                              KAREN
                 You want to get out of here, run, it'll
                 warm you up.

                              GLENN
                 Really?

                              KAREN
                 But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to
                 me...

                              GLENN
                 I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I
                 believe it.  I keep thinking if you
                 hadn't driven me to federal court last
                 summer, you wouldn't even know who I
                 am.

                              KAREN
                 If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow
                 you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it
                 that way.  Go on.

     And he takes off.  She sits there another moment, then flicks
     her cigarette out the door, gets out the car.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

     Karen looks across the street at the theatre, sees people
     leaving.  A few seconds later, she steps behind a car and watches
     as Buddy and Foley pull into the lot.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     Maurice sits with White Boy and Kenneth as Foley and Buddy come
     down the aisle to their table.

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been?  You miss the big boys,
                 come in time for the walkout fights.
                 Well, shit, you may as well pull up a
                 chair.

     Foley and Buddy remain standing.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and
                 this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers.

     Foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY
                 Who's sitting here?

                              MAURICE
                 Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he
                 went to the men's about a while ago
                 and never came back.

     Foley gives Buddy a look.  White Boy Bob grins at them.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I think he must've fell in.

                              MAURICE
                 I sent these two looking for him, they
                 come back shaking their heads.

                              FOLEY
                 Well, if he left his coat and he's
                 been gone a while.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 The car's still there.  I looked.

                              MAURICE
                      (to the ring)
                 Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push
                 him off.

                              FOLEY
                 We're leaving.

                              MAURICE
                 The fuck you talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn
                 is...

     Maurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, what you worried about Glenn
                 for?  What's he know?

                              FOLEY
                 I thought everything.

     Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while
     the other one takes wild swings and misses...

                              MAURICE
                 Glenn knows everything we suppose to
                 do tomorrow.  Glenn could tell somebody
                 that, yeah, but it don't mean shit.
                 You understand?  'Cause Glenn don't
                 know I changed the plan.
                      (then)
                 It's happening tonight.

     Foley looks at Maurice now.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and
                 pick up what we need and go do it.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 You got two minutes, that's all.  Make
                 up your mind.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't asking permission.

     Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 They want to go tonight, before Glenn
                 gets in any trouble, opens his big
                 mouth.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you wanna do?

     Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You know they gonna set us up.

                              FOLEY
                 I get that feeling, yeah.

                              BUDDY
                 But you still think you can get the
                 diamonds fore they do?

     Foley looks at him a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here.
                 Right now.  I'll do the job with the
                 Snoop, meet you wherever you want and
                 give you half.

                              BUDDY
                 Half for doing what?

                              FOLEY
                 Getting me out of Glades for starters.

                              BUDDY
                 And who watches your back?

     ON MAURICE

     As he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy
     and Foley talk up at the bar.

                              MAURICE
                 Man has all that reward on his head
                 and still talks like a con in the yard.
                 You know what I'm saying?  Like he's a
                 man you don't mess with.  Yeah, well,
                 what I say to Jack Foley is buuullshit.

     EXT. MAURICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     It's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and
     Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing
     and heating company on the side.

     We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're watching from inside Karen's
     car.  She waits for the van to pull away, then follows.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Kenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel.  Buddy and Foley
     piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and
     equipment.  Maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls.

                              FOLEY
                 That what they're wearing these days
                 to break and enter?

                              MAURICE
                 Break and enter, shit.  Take it and
                 git, how it's done.  Don't waste any
                 time.  That's how you do it.

                              FOLEY
                 So you've done this before, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted
                 for it.
                      (then)
                 White Boy, tell these boys the reason
                 you went down on that burglary that
                 time.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I left my wallet in the house I robbed.

     The guy grins at them.  Foley can't believe it.

                              MAURICE
                 Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit
                 and leaves his wallet on the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm
                 very excited about tonight.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey.  You learn from doing.

     Foley and Buddy exchange looks.  Maurice turns around, a Beretta
     in his hand.  Foley looks at him.  Buddy tenses.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You know how to use one a these?

                              FOLEY
                 I've seen 'em used on TV.

     Maurice hands Foley the Beretta.  Then reaches into a bag, comes
     up with a .38 he hands to Buddy.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     As Karen tries to keep up with the van.  But with the snow and
     the way Kenneth drives, she starts to lose them.  She speeds up
     around a corner and loses control of the car.

     EXT. STREET - SAME

     As Karen's car does a 360 in the ice and snow.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Buddy and Foley are jostled about the back from Kenneth's insane
     driving.

                              BUDDY
                 Slow down.

     Kenneth grins in the mirror, punches it more.  Buddy gets out
     the .38 and touches it to the back of Kenneth's head.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Get ready to grab the wheel when I
                 shoot this asshole.

     Kenneth, his eyes freaked with speed, glares at Buddy in the
     mirror.

                              MAURICE
                 Do like he says, man.  Slow down.

     EXT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     As a pissed-off Karen gets out of her car, watches the van
     disappear.

                              KAREN
                 Shit --

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     She takes out her cellphone, punches a number, re-orients her
     car at the same time.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As the van creeps by one way, then the other, then pulls into
     the driveway.

     INT./EXT.  VAN - RIPLEY'S HOUSE

     All five of them in the back end of the van now, bumping into
     each other until Maurice lets White Boy out the rear end, leaving
     the doors open enough so he can watch.  He then racks the slide
     on a .45.

                              MAURICE
                 "An army .45 will stop all jive."
                 Huey P. said that.

                              BUDDY
                 You think he was talking about walking
                 into people's houses when he said it?

     Maurice looks at Buddy.  Buddy holds his gaze.  Then the coach
     lights on either side of the front entrance come on.

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls his mask down)
                 Get ready to go skiing.

     Now the front door opens...

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Here we go.

     We catch a glimpse of a WOMAN in the doorway, arms folded over
     her bathrobe as White Boy gives her a push and steps inside the
     house with her.

     Maurice is out of the truck and Kenneth, with a shotgun, is
     scrambling to be next.  Buddy catches him by his jacket collar
     and holds him squirming until Foley is out.

     The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge
     on Buddy, still in the truck.  Foley takes the barrel in one
     hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face.

                              FOLEY
                 Go on in the house before you get hurt.

     Kenneth puts his face up close to Foley's and stares at him
     good before going inside.  Foley turns to Buddy...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 There's still time, take me up on my
                 offer.

                              BUDDY
                 I'm not leaving you alone with these
                 assholes.

     INT. HOUSE - FOYER - SAME

     Where Maurice has the woman backed against a table.  She's in
     her forties, with thick red hair hanging free.  She looks ready
     to take a swing at whoever approaches...

                              WOMAN
                 I work here.  I'm the maid.

     Kenneth reaches out, opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy
     bra and low-cut panties before she slaps him away.

                              WOMAN/MAID
                 Fuck off.

                              KENNETH
                 Hey, shit, we're gonna have a party.

                              MAURICE
                 Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?

                              MAID
                 I told you, he isn't here.

                              MAURICE
                 Out for the evening?

                              MAID
                 He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 When's he due back?

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what difference does it
                 make?  You want to wait for him?

                              MAID
                 Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
                 Christmas to Easter.

                              MAURICE
                 You here all by yourself?

                              MAID
                      (beat)
                 That's right, just me.

     Foley catches the hesitation, glances at Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his
                 valuables in.

                              MAID
                 I don't have any idea.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go upstairs, have a look at the
                 man's bedroom.  All right now, you and
                 Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here.
                 Look at the wall behind any pictures
                 hanging on it.  Look at the walls in
                 the closets.  The man has a safe, it's
                 gonna be up there somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                 How about his place in Florida?  If
                 you'd called, we could've checked his
                 walls down there before we left.  That
                 is, if you'd checked to see where he
                 was.  You follow me?

     Maurice gives him a look, pulls the maid up the stairs.  Kenneth
     and White Boy Bob follow...

                              MAURICE
                 You set off any kind of alarm and you're
                 a dead Hazel.  Understand?

     Kenneth puts his arm around the maid.

                              KENNETH
                 What's you name, mama?

     He hooks a finger in the waist of her panties, pulls on the
     elastic, is about to look in there when Maurice backhands him
     across the face.

                              MAURICE
                 First money, then pussy.

     Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head.

                              FOLEY
                 You ever wear one of these?

                              BUDDY
                 I don't ski.

                              FOLEY
                 Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a
                 look around.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Karen on the phone... snow falling all around her.

                              RAYMOND CRUZ (PHONE)
                 I'll send a unit over there, see if
                 there's anything going on.

                              KAREN
                 Tell me where Ripley's house is.  I'll
                 meet them there.

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 Karen, you gonna promise me you're not
                 gonna go in, do anything stupid till I
                 get there...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

     Full of fat, cushy chairs and a sofa, everything white or black,
     a wet bar, a big TV, CD player.  Buddy moves into the doorway,
     peers inside.

     Kenneth is trying to find a radio station while Maurice and
     White Boy Bob ransack the place.  White Boy Bob checks under
     the mattress...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hey--

     Maurice and Kenneth look over expectantly.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 I found a rubber.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no
                 diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.

     Maurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Where's Foley?

                              BUDDY
                 Checkin' the other rooms, like you
                 said.

                              MAURICE
                      (to White Boy)
                 Go keep an eye on him.

     White Boy Bob slips out of the room.  Maurice turns to Kenneth,
     who's still playing with the stereo.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD.

                              KENNETH
                      (looking them over)
                 I don't recognize none of these bands.

                              MAURICE
                 Just pick one, put it on.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob watches from the end of the hall as Foley peers
     into each of the bedrooms.  Foley sees a back staircase and
     starts down.  A moment later White Boy Bob follows.

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes down the stairs.  No sign of Foley.  White
     Boy starts down one hallway, then turns back.  Now he's lost.
     He opens a door, starts to walk into a closet, then backs out.
     He goes down the hall, turns into...

     THE KITCHEN - SAME

     Where White Boy Bob enters, calls out tentatively.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Uh, Foley?

     He takes in the huge room, the massive sub-zero refrigerator.
     He moves to the freezer, opens it, takes in the FROZEN STEAKS.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Cool.

     INT. HALLWAY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME 

     As Foley quietly moves to the doorway, peers into the kitchen,
     watches White Boy Bob starts going through the freezer, taking
     out steaks and stacking them up on the counter.  Foley shakes
     his head and moves on.

     INT. LIBRARY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME

     Dark.  As Foley steps into the doorway, we BOOM DOWN to reveal
     a LIGHTED AQUARIUM in f.g.  He comes into the room, sits down
     in an armchair beside the fish tank.

     He leans close to the glass, stares at the fish a moment.  He
     sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room,
     sees how the phone cord disappears underneath.

                              FOLEY
                 They cut the lines, Richard.

     Silence.  The door opens and we see a terrified Richard Ripley
     sitting on top of a toilet, the phone in his lap.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley?  That you?

                              FOLEY
                 How are you, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what the hell are you
                 doing here?  What's going on?  Who's
                 upstairs?

                              FOLEY
                 Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

                              RIPLEY
                 Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.

     Ripley moves to the doorway.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Have they got Midge up there?

                              FOLEY
                 What kinda man lets a woman answer the
                 door, this time a night?

                              RIPLEY
                 We thought it might be her husband.
                 Sometimes he comes and checks up on
                 her.  She told him I was down in
                 Florida.

                              FOLEY
                 A minute or two, you're gonna wish you
                 were.

     Ripley looks at him.  Foley pats the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you come on over here, sit
                 down, Richard, have a look at your
                 fish.

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - ROAD - SAME

     As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     The music ON LOUD (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi).  Buddy stands
     in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he
     takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look
     them over.  He tries on a coat, turns to the maid.

                              MAURICE
                 How do I look, mama?

                              MAID
                 Like a fag.

     Maurice smiles at her, goes back into the closet.  Kenneth stares
     at the maid, nodding slowly.

                              KENNETH
                 I think she like to tussle with me.
                 Get boned a way she gonna remember.

     She looks to the doorway, where Buddy now starts to take a step
     into the room, when Maurice comes out of the closet...

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Motherfucker!

     He sticks his head out of the closet.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I found the safe.

     Buddy backs out of the room.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen drives slowly past the house.  White Boy Bob emerges
     with an armload of steaks and sets them on the front steps.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy!  Get your ass up here!

     White Boy Bob hurries back into the house.

     INT. RIPLEY'S LIBRARY - SAME

     Ripley sits on the couch across from Foley.  He keeps looking
     up at the ceiling.

                              RIPLEY
                 What do you want from me, Jack?  Name
                 it.  You want money?

                              FOLEY
                 You gonna write me a check?

                              RIPLEY
                 We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a
                 withdrawal.

     Foley just looks at him.  Buddy sticks his head in the room.

                              BUDDY
                 They found the safe.

                              FOLEY
                 You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, hi.  Nice house.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thank you.

     INT. BEDROOM - CLOSET DOORWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes in as Kenneth and Maurice are getting ready
     to blast the safe with the shotgun and pistol.

                              MAURICE
                 We gonna open up this fucker...

     Maurice and his boys open fire on the safe.  The maid covers up
     as bullets begin ricocheting all over the room.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Jesus...!

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     Karen sees the muzzle flashes in the upstairs window and quickly
     gets out of the car.

     INT. STUDY - SAME

     As Buddy and Ripley look up.

                              RIPLEY
                      (gets up)
                 Good God... they're shooting Midge!

                              FOLEY
                      (pushes him down)
                 Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open
                 the safe, not your maid.

     INT. BEDROOM

     As Maurice, Kenneth and White Boy Bob get ready to fire again.

                              MAURICE
                 A'ight, this time we gotta get the
                 motherfuckin' trajectory right...
                      (pause)
                 Okay, on three:  One... Two...

                              MAID
                 The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

     They all turn to look at her, guns still pointing at the safe.

                              MAID (CONT'D)
                 Richard's birthday.

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen cautiously makes her way towards the front door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     As Maurice finally gets the safe open.  They all anxiously peer
     inside.  Maurice narrows his eyes, reaches in, pulls out one of
     three toupees.  He stares at it.

                              MAURICE
                 ...the fuck is this...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Are they dead?

     He looks at White Boy Bob...

                              MAURICE
                 Go find Foley.  NOW!

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Foley leans forward in the chair now...

                              RIPLEY
                 I can't believe you're still angry
                 with me, Jack, after all this time.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm not angry, Richard.
                      (staring at the tank)
                 In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing
                 is, I can't tell if it's the fish
                 that're cooling me out or all those
                 uncut diamonds on the bottom of the
                 tank there.

     Ripley sags, closes his eyes.

                              BUDDY
                 Damn--

     And now Buddy takes a closer look and now we, too, see that
     strewn about the bottom of the aquarium are dozens of uncut
     diamonds of various sizes.

                              FOLEY
                 Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about
                 five million worth in there, wouldn't
                 you say, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Five point two.

                              BUDDY
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              FOLEY
                 They sure do.

     He gets up, looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Go get a bag.

     Foley turns to Richard as Buddy comes back into the room with a
     plastic bag, starts reaching into the tank.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I were you, I'd get up and run.

                              RIPLEY
                 I'm not leaving Midge.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're
                 gonna kill you.

                              RIPLEY
                 If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I love her, Jack.

     Foley looks at Buddy.  Now what?

                              BUDDY
                 C'mon.

     Foley just looks at Ripley, who doesn't move.

                              FOLEY
                 Good luck, Richard.

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Someone down here?

     Buddy and Foley slip out the other door, down the hall, just as
     Maurice walks in, some of Ripley's clothes over his arm.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.

                              RIPLEY
                 Are those my suits?

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been hiding, Dick?

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     A now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley
     and Buddy emerge from the house.

     AT THE VAN

     As Buddy leans under the dash.  Foley looks up at the house
     where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear
     the faint pumping of the music.  We hear the VAN START.

                              BUDDY
                 Okay.

     Buddy straightens up, looks at Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Come on.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

                              BUDDY
                 What?

                              FOLEY
                 They're gonna rape the maid, aren't
                 they.

                              BUDDY
                 From the looks of those boys, the
                 Ripper too.

                              FOLEY
                 And then they'll kill 'em.

                              BUDDY
                 At least.

     Foley looks at the diamonds in the bag.

                              FOLEY
                 We made it, didn't we?

                              BUDDY
                 All you gotta do is get in.

     Again Foley looks at the diamonds, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm going back inside.

                              BUDDY
                 I'll go with you.

     Foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it...

                              FOLEY
                 No, you dump the van, meet me at the
                 airport.
                 I'll take one of Ripley's cars.

                              BUDDY
                 Jack --

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about
                 to go down, you'll be on the phone
                 with your sister for a month.  Let me
                 do this part alone.

     Buddy just looks at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I'm saying this isn't your problem.
                 Far as I'm concerned, we're square.

     Foley turns to go.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey...

     Buddy hands him his gun.  Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back
     of his pants, and then turns back to the house.

                              FOLEY
                 Now get outta here.

     KAREN
     
     As she watches Foley go back inside.  A moment later, the van
     pulls out of the driveway.  Karen makes a decision, starts for
     the side of the house...

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE - THE FOYER - SAME

     Foley enters and we hear the maid scream.  Foley starts up
     the stairs.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY

     Maurice and White Boy Bob both have their guns to Ripley's head.

                              RIPLEY
                      (hears the scream)
                 Midge.

                              MAURICE
                 Forget about her.  Tell me where the
                 money's at.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley's got it.

                              MAURICE
                 Where the fuck is Foley?

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME

     Foley comes up the stairs, heads for Ripley's bedroom.  The
     door is closed now...

                              FOLEY
                 Midge?

     He steps to one side, is about to reach for the knob when
     suddenly the DOOR IS BLASTED OFF ITS HINGES.

     INT. KITCHEN (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME TIME

     Karen comes through the door, hears the gunshot, stops cold.

     INT. HALLWAY (UPSTAIRS) - SAME

     As Foley steps into the doorway and we see Kenneth and the maid
     bare, both sitting up in bed, Kenneth racking the shotgun, the
     maid turning away from him, gathering the covers that hang off
     her side of the bed...

     ...and coming around to throw them like a net at Kenneth as the
     shotgun goes off and the covers catch fire as Foley pumps one
     two three shots into Kenneth somewhere under there.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Ripley tries to get away...

                              RIPLEY
                 Midge!

     Maurice grabs him by the collar, spins him around and whips him
     across the face with his gun.  He and White Boy Bob then both
     hit Ripley on the head until he goes down and stays down.

                              MAURICE
                      (to WBB)
                 You take the front stairs, I'll take
                 the back.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As the maid jumps up and drags the burning covers from the bed
     and sees Kenneth now, the bullet holes in his chest, staring
     blankly back at him.  She then looks at Foley.

                              MAID
                      (cold)
                 Where's Dick?

                              FOLEY
                 Downstairs.
                      (then)
                 But wait here.  There's two more.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley starts out of the room and immediately hears...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hold it, asshole!

     Foley sees White Boy Bob at the bottom of the stairs.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Drop the gun.

     Nowhere to go, Foley has to comply.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Now stay right there.  Don't move.

     White Boy Bob starts to jog up the stairs two at a time, all
     the while keeping his eyes fixed on Foley.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Maurice!  I got Foley!

     INT. RIPLEY'S BACK STAIRCASE - SAME

     As Maurice starts up the backstairs...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Maurice!  Up here!

     ...and a moment later, Karen comes out of the kitchen into the
     downstairs hallway -- just missing each other.

     INT. STAIRCASE - SAME

     As White Boy Bob gets maybe half way up when he catches a toe
     on one of the risers and pitches forward.  Stupidly, he tries
     to break his fall with the elbow of his gun hand and ends up
     jamming his chin down onto the muzzle of his gun which,
     unfortunately for him, goes off, firing a bullet through his
     head and killing him instantly.

     To say the least, Foley is stunned by this freak accident.  He
     stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 You learn from doing.

     Foley bends down to pick up his gun and we see MAURICE COMING
     UP THE BACK STAIRCASE, his gun raised, and now firing away...

     Foley is forced to jump back behind a pillar as Maurice keeps
     firing at him, shots ricocheting off the pillar, the railing,
     the wall...

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Karen hugs the wall at the sound of gunshots, sees Ripley
     lying on the floor of the study...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As we hear CLICK as the breech opens on Maurice's now empty .45
     And now Foley steps out from behind the pillar and calmly bends
     down, picks up his gun, Maurice still walking forward...

                              MAURICE
                 Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?

                              FOLEY
                 Not until recently.

                              MAURICE
                      (still coming)
                 Nervous?

                              FOLEY
                 A little.

                              MAURICE
                      (getting close)
                 This kind of setup, you don't have any
                 idea what the fuck you're doing -- do
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 You're right.  So why take a chance--

     Foley pulls the trigger.  CLICK.  Maurice hesitates, surprised
     that Foley would pull the trigger, then the two of them at the
     same time rush each other, begin a messy mano a mano, now using
     their spent guns as bludgeons.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Karen carefully comes into the room, Ripley lets out a low
     GROAN.  She's bending down to check him when HER PHONE RINGS.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley and Maurice grapple on the floor near the head of the
     stairs.

     INT. STUDY - SAME

     As Karen answers her phone, checks Ripley...

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 We're a few minutes away.  Just sit
                 tight, stay outta the house till we
                 get there, understand?

                              KAREN
                 Oh-kay...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.  Maurice rolls
     down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as...
     
     Foley gets up, runs back to the bedroom.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins
     searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over
     the body, etc) with no success...

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk
     of White Boy Bob.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley, exasperated, stands back up...

                              MIDGE (O.S.)
                 This what you want?

     Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe,
     but more importantly, clutching the shotgun.  Foley crosses and
     takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when --

                              MIDGE (CONT'D)
                 It's empty.

     Foley just looks at her.

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with
     a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs...

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Maurice--

     Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing
     in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him...

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS,
     then a BODY FALL.

     He stands still.  Not sure who was just shot.  After a long moment,
     we then hear:

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the
     wall.

                              KAREN (OS) (CONT'D)
                 I know you're up there.

     INT. FOYER - SAME

     As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down
     over his face.  He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his
     pistol in another.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Jack -- don't.

                              FOLEY
                 Pretend I'm somebody else.

                              KAREN
                 You think I'd shoot you?

     Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun.  AND NOW WE HEAR
     THE SIRENS...

                              FOLEY
                 If you don't, one of those guys will.

                              KAREN
                 What're you now, a desperado?  Put the
                 guns down.

                              FOLEY
                 I told you, I'm not going back.

     He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen,
     but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or
     look around.

                              KAREN
                 Don't do this.  Please.

     They stand there staring at each other.

                              FOLEY
                 No more time outs.

     He raises the guns.  She sadly shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns,
     grabbing hold of his right thigh.  And now Cruz and several
     other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop...

                              CRUZ
                 Karen, I told you not to--

                              KAREN
                 Wait, I know him --okay?

     She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently
     lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 You just did, for Christ sake.

                              KAREN
                 You know what I mean.

     She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer
     to him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wish things were different.  I'm
                 sorry, Jack.

     Foley looks like he's in pain.  He watches as she walks back
     down the stairs.  As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and
     pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer.

                              MIDGE
                 Richard!

     She comes running down the stairs into his arms.  They embrace.
     He looks at Foley over her shoulder...

                              RIPLEY
                      (sympathetic)
                 Listen, Jack...
                      (but then)
                 What'd you do with my diamonds?

     Foley just looks at him.

     EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT

     As Buddy pulls the van into an alley.  He jumps out, jogs back
     to the street and hails a cab...

     INT. CAB - SAME

     Buddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass.

                              BUDDY
                 The airport.

     The cab pulls away.  Buddy glances up front, then pulls the
     Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up.  There's a bit of
     water in along with the diamonds.  A tiny fish swims in the
     water.  Something about this makes Buddy smile as we...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. KAREN'S HOTEL - MORNING

     The sun is out.  The sky is clear.

                              KAREN (VO)
                 They don't know yet if they want to
                 bring him up on the homicides.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

     Karen on the phone.  Her suitcase on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 I doubt if they will.  The Bureau's
                 put a detainer on him, so when they're
                 through with him here he'll go back to
                 Florida.

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Marshall on the phone...

                              MARSHALL
                 You gonna go get him?

                              KAREN
                 It's possible.  Why?

                              MARSHALL
                 I was just thinking... you could have
                 a nice time with him on the plane --
                 like picking up where your interlude,
                 or whatever you call it, left off.
                 And then throw him in the can.

                              KAREN
                 He knew what he was doing.  Nobody
                 forced him to rob banks.

                              MARSHALL
                 My little girl, the tough babe.

     Karen hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window.

     INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

     Where Foley stands staring out of his window.

                              VOICE
                 Foley.

     As Foley turns around and faces a FEDERAL MARSHAL in the doorway,
     we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled.

     INT/EXT. PRISON STATION GARAGE - DAY

     The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black
     government van waits.  The Marshal helps Foley inside.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Have a nice trip.
                      (looks OS)
                 I'll get the other one.

     INT/EXT. VAN - SAME

     As Foley sits down, stares at the floor.  He looks depressed.
     We hear the front door open, then close.

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that
     separates the front from the back.

                              KAREN
                 I got you a present, something for the
                 road.

     She pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I have to take it away, though, soon
                 as the ride's over.

     Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once
     more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with
     a shaved head -- into the back of the van.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.

     An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the
     door then gets in up front with Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 Hejira?  What kinda name is that?

                              HEJIRA
                 Islamic.

                              FOLEY
                 What's it mean, "No Hair"?

                              HEJIRA
                 The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed
                 from Mecca in 622.

                              FOLEY
                 The flight?

                              HEJIRA
                 The brothers in Leavenworth gave me
                 the name.

                              FOLEY
                 You were at Leavenworth, huh?

                              HEJIRA
                 For a time.

                              FOLEY
                 Meaning?

                              HEJIRA
                 Meaning time came, I left.

                              FOLEY
                 You busted out?

                              HEJIRA
                 I prefer to call it an exodus from an
                 undesirable place.

                              FOLEY
                      (interested now)
                 And how long was it before they caught
                 up with you?

                              HEJIRA
                 That time?

                              FOLEY
                 There were others.

                              HEJIRA
                 Yeah.  That was the ninth.

                              FOLEY
                      (really interested)
                 The ninth?

                              HEJIRA
                 Ten, you count the prison hospital in
                 Ohio I walked away from.

                              FOLEY
                 You must be some kinda walker, Henry.

                              HEJIRA
                 Hejira.

                              FOLEY
                 And so now you're off to Glades.

                              HEJIRA
                 Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to
                 leave last night with the lady marshal,
                 but for some reason she wanted to wait.

                              FOLEY
                      (looks at Karen)
                 She did, huh.

                              HEJIRA
                 Cheaper I guess, take us both down in
                 one van.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought
                 we'd have a lot to talk about.

                              HEJIRA
                 Like what?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.
                      (then)
                 It's a long way down to Florida.

     Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and
     considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little
     higher than when he first sat down, as we then...

     BLACK

     We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then...

     FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY

     The financial district.  Lots of people in suits.  A shaky,
     spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...

     JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a
     tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.  He
     starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and
     dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then...

     WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     As Foley goes inside, we then...

     CUT TO: A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS...

                        LOOKING FOR MONEY?

                  YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

     We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're now...

     INSIDE THE BANK

     as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
     while he studies the bank layout.

     Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter
     the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
     area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes
     hands with the man and they both sit down.

     Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller
     window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
     with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA.

                              TELLER/LORETTA
                 How can I help you, sir?

                              FOLEY
                 Loretta, you see that guy talking to
                 your manager, has his case open?

     Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually, yet expertly,
     begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.

                              LORETTA
                 That's Mr. Guindon, one of our assistant
                 managers.  Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
                 but he's not in today.

                              FOLEY
                 But you see the guy with the attache
                 case?

                              LORETTA
                      (looks again)
                 Yes.

                              FOLEY
                 That's my partner.  He has a gun in
                 there.  And if you don't do exactly
                 what I tell you, or you give me any
                 kind of a problem, I'll look over at
                 my partner and he'll shoot your Mr.
                 Guindon between the eyes.

     Loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at Foley.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Now take one of those big envelopes
                 and put as many hundreds, fifties and
                 twenties as you can pack into it.
                 Nothing with bank straps or rubber
                 bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I
                 don't want any bait money.  Start with
                 the second drawer and then the one
                 over there, under the computer.  Come
                 on, Loretta, the key's right there
                 next to you.  No bills off the bottom
                 of the drawer.
                      (as she works)
                 First time being robbed?
                      (she nods)
                 You're doing great.  Just smile,
                 Loretta, so you won't look like you're
                 being held up.
                      (she smiles awkwardly)
                 That's the way, you're doing fine.

     We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the
     front door.  When he turns back, he sees that Loretta's having
     some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here, give me the twenties.  I'll put
                 'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had
                 to give my partner a sign; that's good.
                 Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds
                 till after I'm out the door, make sure
                 you haven't set off the alarm.  If you
                 have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon
                 between the eyes.  Okay?  I think
                 that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta,
                 and have a nice day.

                              LORETTA
                 You, too.

     Foley heads for the door.  He pauses by Mr. Guindon's desk,
     looks back at Loretta.  Foley smiles at her, then turns to the
     Man sitting with Mr. Guindon, indicates Loretta...

                              FOLEY
                 She's cute, isn't she?

     The man looks across the bank at Loretta.

                              MAN
                 Uh, yeah, I guess so.

     Foley winks at Loretta and walks out.

                              MAN (CONT'D)
                      (to Mr. Guindon)
                 Who was that?

     EXT. BANK - SAME

     As Foley comes out, he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in.

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Foley tries to start the car.  No go.  He tries again.

                              FOLEY
                 Come on...

     But the car won't start.  Foley bangs on the wheel...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Fuck!

     Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open
     window into Foley's ear...

                              COP
                 I think you flooded it.

     Foley looks to the passenger window, where ANOTER COP, smiling,
     now has his gun pointing at him.

                              SECOND COP
                 Get out've the car, sir.

                              FOLEY
                 Wanna hear a funny story?

                              SECOND COP
                 Shut up and get out've the car.

     And as Foley obliges, we then...

     FADE TO WHITE.

     We hear a MAN GRUNT.  Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps
     through frame, now we see a basketball come up in his hand as
     we realize he's on his way to the rim when...

     ...ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air, knocks him down.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     A BASKETBALL GAME in progress.  All of the men, Foley included,
     are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts.  The game is
     rough.  Hair is pulled.  Eyes are poked.  Faces punched.

     A title reads: "GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION.  BELLE GLADE,
     FLORIDA."

     Foley is the oldest player here.  He's getting tired, starts to
     lose his breath.  He finally walks off the court, breathing so
     hard he can't even talk.  He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
     to come in and take his place.

     Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath.  He looks
     across the yard to where...

     A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES

     sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards.  All of
     them are over sixty.  One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches
     hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...

     INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:

     As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
     Mal and Lucky Strike packs.  Another tends to a tomato bush in
     a tiny patch of garden near the wall.  Another one sits nearby
     painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.

     Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
     his eye.  He watches as...

     TWO LATINO MEN

     both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop
     and begin stretching out.  One of them nods to Foley.  Foley
     nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks
     over to a guard, PUPKO ("PUP"), heavy-set, dumb as dirt.

                              PUP
                 You want something, Foley?

     Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game.

                              FOLEY
                 Some people are going out of here.
                 What if I told you where and when?

                              PUP
                 How many?

                              FOLEY
                 I expect you to look out for me, Pup,
                 let me run off work details.

                              PUP
                 Okay.  How many going out?

                              FOLEY
                 I hear six.

                              PUP
                 When?

                              FOLEY
                 Looks like tonight.

                              PUP
                 You know who they are?

                              FOLEY
                 I do, but I won't tell you just yet.
                 Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty,
                 right before lock-down.

     INT. MESS HALL - LUNCH

     As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle, he scans the sea
     of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
     at a table full of other little Latins.  CHINO -- fifties, in
     shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.

     Chino's "wife", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray
     of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
     with a bunch of bikers.

     Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
     off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too.

     EXT. MESS - DAY

     Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette.  He puts an arm
     around Lulu, starts to walk off...

                              FOLEY (OS)
                 Today's the day, huh?

     Chino looks over, watches Foley approach, lets his arm slip
     down so he can hook his thumb into Lulu's belt... the next
     thing to having him on a leash.

                              FOLEY
                 You excited?

                              CHINO
                 I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but I see you moved it up.

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 Why you think is today?

                              FOLEY
                 You were out running this morning,
                 sticking to your routine, anybody
                 happened to notice.  But you only did
                 a couple of miles instead of your usual
                 five.  Saving yourself for the main
                 event.  Then I see you inside eating
                 ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates
                 for endurance.

     Chino and Lulu exchange looks.

                              CHINO
                 You want, I tole you you can come.
                 You all right, Foley.  I like you.

                              FOLEY
                 You told me I can come 'cause I caught
                 you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you
                 and Lulu coming out of the bushes,
                 thought maybe you two were making out.

     Foley smiles at Lulu, who glares back at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 So what, you finish ahead of schedule?

     Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.

                              CHINO
                 You see what they doing, those posts
                 out there?  Putting up another fence,
                 five metres on the other side of the
                 one that's there.  We wait until Super
                 Bowl Sunday, they could have the second
                 fence built and we have to dig another
                 nine, ten days.  So we going soon as
                 it's dark.  You want -- I mean it --
                 you can still come.

                              FOLEY
                 I appreciate the offer.  And it's
                 tempting.

     Foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence
     not twenty yards away.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 But, man, it's a long run to
                 civilization.  A hundred miles to Miami?
                 I'm too old to start acting crazy, try
                 a stunt like that.  You make it out,
                 send me a postcard.

     CUT TO: A NOTEPAD

     where we see someone has written "IT'S MAGIC!" then crossed out
     the "IT'S" and replaced it with the word "LIKE".  We hear THE
     PHONE RING AND...

     REVEAL: INT. ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Miami Beach Moderne.  ADELE -- mid-thirties, pretty, Foley's ex --
     sits at her kitchen table writing on a pad.  She grabs the phone.

                              ADELE
                 Hello?
                      (then, sighs)
                 Yeah, I accept.

     INT. PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

     Foley on the phone...

                              FOLEY'S VOICE
                 Hey, Adele, how you doing?

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & ADELE:

                              ADELE
                 Hey, Bank Robber, want some advice?
                 Next time, leave the engine running.

                              FOLEY
                 That's funny, Adele.  How many more
                 times you gonna gimme that one?

                              ADELE
                 Till it's not funny any more.  What do
                 you want, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 You know that Super Bowl party?  They
                 changed the date.  It's on tonight,
                 eight-thirty.

                              ADELE
                 Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't
                 monitored?

                              FOLEY
                 I said not as a rule.

                              ADELE
                 So why don't you come right out and
                 tell me what you're talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there
                 in the free world.

                              ADELE
                 What's free about it?  I'm looking for
                 work.

                              FOLEY
                 What happened to Mandrake the Magician?

                              ADELE
                 Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired
                 me and hired another girl, a redhead.
                 I'm working on a new business card,
                 pass out to the cafes.  How's this
                 sound--

                              FOLEY
                      (cuts her off)
                 Listen, Adele, the reason I called,
                 that party is today instead of Sunday.
                 About eight-thirty, like only a few
                 hours from now.  So you'll have to get
                 hold of Buddy, whatever he might be
                 doing...

                              ADELE
                 And the one driving the other car?

                              FOLEY
                 What're you talking about?

                              ADELE
                 Well, seeing as you have so much luck
                 with cars, Buddy thought it might be
                 better to bring two.  He got this guy
                 he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn
                 something.

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn Michaels.

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn
                 thinks you guys are real cool.

                              FOLEY
                 He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see
                 Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step
                 on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off
                 first.

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     As MARSHALL SISCO -- fifty -- slides a small wrapped box across
     a table...

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday.

     ...to where KAREN SISCO -- twenty-eight, black suit, long hair,
     a knockout -- sits.  She picks up the box and shakes it.

                              KAREN
                 You fit another Chanel suit in here?

                              MARSHALL
                 Something better.  Open it.

     Karen starts to carefully unwrap the present.  Marshall watches,
     takes a sip of his drink, looks around the bar, sees how
     everyone's looking at the two of them...

                              KAREN
                      (opens the box)
                 Oh my God...

     She pulls a gleaming automatic pistol from the box...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It's beautiful.

                              MARSHALL
                 It's a --

                              KAREN
                 --Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.

     She leans across the table and kisses him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Thanks, Dad.

                              MARSHALL
                 Happy birthday, kid.
                      (then)
                 You want another Coke?

                              KAREN
                      (checks her watch)
                 Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades,
                 then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.

                              MARSHALL
                 Which one is that?  The ATF guy?

                              KAREN
                 He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now,
                 he switched over.

                              MARSHALL
                 He's still married though, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Technically.  They're separated.

                              MARSHALL
                 Oh, he's moved out?

                              KAREN
                 He's about to.

                              MARSHALL
                 Then they're not separated, are they?

                              KAREN
                 Can we change the subject?

                              MARSHALL
                 What're you doing at Glades?

                              KAREN
                 Serving process, a Summons and
                 Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory
                 life doesn't like macaroni and cheese.
                 He files suit, says he has no choice
                 in what they serve and it violates his
                 civil rights.

                              MARSHALL
                 You know you can always step in, work
                 with me full-time as one of my
                 investigators.

                              KAREN
                 No thanks.

                              MARSHALL
                 You used to like it.

                              KAREN
                 Dad...

                              MARSHALL
                 You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing
                 wrong with them necessarily if they're
                 divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy
                 cop who drinks too much and cheats on
                 his wife?  That's the way those hotshots
                 are, all of 'em.

                              KAREN
                 I really gotta go.

                              MARSHALL
                 We don't get to talk much any more.

                              KAREN
                 How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch
                 the Super Bowl with you?

                              MARSHALL
                 I'd like that.

     She gets up, kisses him again.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks for the gun, Dad.

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY

     Foley comes in, lies down on the bunk.  He looks about the
     cell.  All he's got to show for himself.  It's now quiet on
     the cellblock.  Foley closes his eyes and we...

     CUT TO: EXT. PRISON AUDITORIUM

     A few hundred cons scream encouragement/insults as MAURICE
     "SNOOPY" MILLER, a lanky, scary, mean-looking black man in boxing
     trunks, hits a white guy with a ferocious hook.

     Title reads: LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.  LOMPOC, CALIFORNIA.
     And then... TWO YEARS AGO.

     AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM

     Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black,
     Foley's age, shaved head.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner, as
     does Maurice.  GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look, dark shades --
     counts cash in Maurice's corner, whispers something into the
     fighter's ear.

                              BUDDY
                 Ref don't call it pretty soon, Snoopy's
                 gonna send this guy out in a body bag.

     Foley watches a MAN -- fifties, out of place, not as hard-looking
     as those around him.  The guy looks nervous, can feel the other
     cons' eyes on him as he tries to find a seat.

     The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet.
     Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling.  Foley turns
     and watches the fight now...

                              FOLEY
                 Anyone ever tell you why they call him
                 Snoopy?

     Buddy shakes his head.  Maurice dances around the other guy
     now.  Teases him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 He was Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller back
                 when he was pro.  Now you pet him, he
                 goes down.

     The white guy throws a tired, loping roundhouse that barely
     glances off Maurice's jaw.  Sure enough, Maurice makes a big
     show out of snapping his head back, staggering, before he finally
     goes down.

                              BUDDY
                 I don't believe it.

     Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him
     and, anxious now, he tries to get out of there.

     EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

     Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as
     nearby, the "winning" BOXER -- still wearing last night's
     pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons.  He throws
     a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning
     technique...

                              BUDDY
                 Guy's braggin' he won a thrown fight.
                 Fuckin' pathetic.

     Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now
     stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy, one
     hand thrust into his pocket.  Foley watches as Maurice stops
     the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the
     fights -- as he comes out into the yard.

                              FOLEY
                 It's Richard Ripley.

                              BUDDY
                      (looking now)
                 The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I
                 didn't recognize him without his rug.

     Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate, the guy
     nodding, acquiescent, respectful.

                              FOLEY
                 Dick the Ripper they called him, on
                 account of all the people he ripped
                 off.

     Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he doin' here?

                              GLENN (OS)
                 Three years.

     They look to where Glenn Michaels, the blond guy in dark shades
     we saw in Maurice's corner, works out on the bench press a few
     feet away.  He's shirtless, tan, in shape.

                              GLENN
                 He got three years and fined fifty
                 million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking
                 check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed
                 his name.
                      (struggles with the
                       bar)
                 Whoa-- little help here!

                              FOLEY
                 Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or
                 Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those
                 shades on.

                              GLENN
                 You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!

                              FOLEY
                 I guess the bright glare out here made
                 it hard to see the numbers on the
                 weights.

                              GLENN
                 I'll take the shades off.  Just get
                 this fuckin' thing off me.

     Foley helps him get the bar up.  Glenn sits up.

                              BUDDY
                 How do you know he wrote a check?

                              GLENN
                 He told me.  He works the laundry with
                 me.  The guy loves to talk.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, to the U.S. Attorney.  I hear he
                 rolled over on all the snitches he was
                 doing business with and got 'em all
                 brought up.

     He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley, one eye always on the
     swaggering boxer across the yard, one hand in his pocket.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, anybody that can write a check
                 for fifty mil, he says anything I'm
                 all fucking ears.  Like the other day,
                 he tells me how he's got all this money
                 in foreign banks, plus around five mil
                 in uncut diamonds at his house.  He
                 said, quote, "Where I can put my hands
                 on it anytime."

                              BUDDY
                 Cool.  Where's the guy live?

     Foley watches a few more of Maurice's friends surround Ripley.
     Again, Ripley takes out his black book, starts nodding, making
     notations...

                              GLENN
                 Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut
                 diamonds are as easy to move as cash.

                              FOLEY
                 Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs?
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              GLENN
                 So.  What's your point?

                              FOLEY
                 My point is, that's probably what you're
                 gonna end up with.

                              GLENN
                 You think he's lying?

                              FOLEY
                 Use your head.  The guys got five
                 million lying around his house, you
                 really think he's gonna tell some
                 motormouth he just met in prison about
                 it?

     A BELL SOUNDS.  Everyone starts walking for the gate.

     Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate,
     Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket.

     SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate, sees Maurice who
     moves to him now, smiling like he's so glad to see him... his
     left hand clapping the guy on the back, saying something like
     congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket
     and we see the long metal shiv--

                              BUDDY
                      (watching Snoopy)
                 Here it comes.

     Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxer's shoulder and hugs
     him tight for a moment, then quickly moves away.  The Boxer
     stands there like a statue, doesn't move until he's at last
     jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I guess the Snoop doesn't like to lose,
                 even if it's on purpose.

     We hear a WHISTLE BLOW as a GUARD spots the body.  And now
     everyone moves like hell for the gate... except for...

     Richard Ripley who stands there frozen, staring down at the
     body.

     Foley glances back at the approaching guards, casually takes
     Ripley by the arm as he passes, leads him away from there, talks
     to him as they walk into the block...

                              FOLEY
                 You don't wanna be standing there, the
                 hacks start asking questions you don't
                 wanna answer.

                              RIPLEY
                 Oh, uh, right, thanks...

     Foley then moves away.  He sees Maurice looking back at him,
     giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. FOLEY'S CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW)

     He lies there another moment when...

     A PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk.
     Foley's CELLMATE jumps down, walks the three feet or so to the
     toilet, casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the
     bathroom.  Foley shakes his head and turns away...

     EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

     As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling
     a slim-jim from the back of his pants, about to jimmy the door,
     when he sees...

     A WOMAN -- middle-aged, wearing pearls and high heels -- come
     out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries.

     Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants, waits until the woman
     is opening her trunk before coming forward...

                              BUDDY
                 Here, lemme help you with those, ma'am.

     She doesn't seem too sure about it, but lets him load the
     groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock.

                              WOMAN
                 I didn't ask for your help, so don't
                 expect a tip.

     Buddy smiles, waves her off.

                              BUDDY
                 That's okay, ma'am.  I'll just take
                 your car.

     She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     In the midst of a remodel.  As door opens and Pup comes in.
     Foley puts a finger to his lips...

                              FOLEY
                 They're right underneath you, Pup.
                 They dug a tunnel.

     Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the
     chapel, eyes on the floor, listening...

                              PUP
                 I don't hear 'em.  Where's the tunnel
                 come out?

     Pup turns his back, walks up the aisle and across the front of
     the pews to a window.

                              FOLEY
                 Second fence post from the tower out
                 there.  Go on, take a look.

     As Pup stares out the window...

                              PUP
                 I don't see nothing there.

     Foley reaches down into a pew where's stashed a FOUR-FOOT
     CRUCIFIX.  He picks it up, starts up the aisle...

                              FOLEY
                 You will directly.  Keep watching.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - DUSK

     As the high beams from her car show the prison parking area,
     then the fence strung with razor wire.  Karen parks near the
     fence, lights a cigarette and dials her car phone.

                              KAREN
                 Hi.  Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet.
                      (beat)
                 He's not?  Could you tell him that...
                 never mind.  I'll call back.

     Headlights hit Karen's rear-view mirror, a car pulling in behind
     her.  The lights go off, then come on again.  She adjusts the
     mirror to deflect the glare.

     INT. THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK

     As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field.
     He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen
     checks her face out in the rear-view.

     INT. CHAPEL - DUSK

     As Foley moves up behind Pup, he lets his jacket fall to the floor,
     holds the crucifix down against his leg.

                              PUP
                 There some car headlights out there...
                      (then)
                 Jesus Christ...

     Now he pulls his radio from his belt, says into it...

                              PUP (CONT'D)
                 Man outside the fence!  By tower six!
                      (responds to radio)
                 This is Officer Pupko...
                      (then)
                 I'm looking at him, for Christ's sake!

     Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it
     smack against the side of Pup's head.  Drops him clean with one
     swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a
     sound coming from him.

     INT. KAREN SISCO'S CAR - NIGHT

     As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car
     door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there,
     crouching down.

     Karen turns on her headlights.  No, not crouched.  The guy is
     coming out of the ground.  On this side of the fence.

     Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the
     ground.  Right in front of her.

     Karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by
     the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights, poised
     there for a moment before taking off into the dark.  Karen gets
     out of the car...

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow
     the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before
     the men disappear into the dark.

     Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he
     gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her
     trunk...

                              BUDDY
                 What's she doing?

     He watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a
     holstered pistol.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     But then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there
     again and comes out this time racking a shotgun.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Uh-oh.

     And now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and
     raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND.
     Buddy gets out of the car...

     EXT. PARKING AREA - SAME

     As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty,
     standing by the hole they just crawled out of.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands in the air!

     Buddy watches the two cons, both Latins, make up their minds,
     start edging away -- shit, they've come this far.

     They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark,
     then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate,
     to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it
     for the cons.  They take off running...

     Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't
     fire...

     The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it,
     open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are
     cut down as they run.

     The hacks glance at Karen, but don't bother with her, more
     interested in the hole the convicts had come out of.  Now they're
     standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons
     ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other
     as...

     A head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying
     something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited,
     pointing towards the orange grove.

     They run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to
     see if they're alive, then keep going.

     The man in the hole, Foley, climbs out.  He takes his time,
     puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an
     honest-to-God hack, that serious cap down on his eyes.

     Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the
     shotgun on Buddy.  Buddy raises the palm of his hand.

                              BUDDY
                 It's okay, honey, we're good guys.

                              KAREN
                 What're you doing here?

     Not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when
     they're already pretty sure what you're doing.  She glances
     around to include Foley, now coming at her like some creature
     out of the swamp, giving Buddy time to take her around the neck.

     She fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the
     shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip.

     They drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still
     up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence,
     past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange
     grove.  A moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet that's all the hacks they send
                 out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind
                 the store.

                              BUDDY
                 Why don't we talk about it later?

     He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the
     headlights from Buddy's car; Karen not at all afraid.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you're just a girl.  What do you
                 do for a living you pack a shotgun?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest, both of you guys.

     Foley keeps staring at her like he's giving the situation serious
     thought, but what he says is...

                              FOLEY
                 I bet I smell, don't I?
                      (then)
                 Listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll
                 get out of here.

     Karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk.  She's
     reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when...

     Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against
     the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're
     cuddled up in bed.

     He holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the
     gun in his face.  Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then
     everything goes...

     BLACK

     Total darkness, not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing.
     Then we hear the engine come to life, the car moving along.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You comfy?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 If I could have a little more room.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 There isn't any.  All this shit you
                 got in here.  What is all this stuff
                 anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's
                 this can?

                              KAREN (VO)
                 For your breath.  You could use it.
                 Squirt some in your mouth.

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've
                 you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor
                 unfortunate offenders.

     A BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it
     on.  He plays the beam along Karen's leg, calms down some as he
     looks at all of her now and finally says...

                              FOLEY (VO)
                 Where's your gun, your pistol?

                              KAREN
                 In my bag, in the car.

     They go over some bumps.  We hear men's voices from somewhere
     far off, outside.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know you don't have a chance of
                 making it.  Guards are out here already,
                 they'll stop the car.

     He runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also,
     just, well, looking.

                              FOLEY
                 They're off in the cane by now chasing
                 Cubans.  I timed it to slip between
                 the cracks, you might say.

                              FOLEY
                 Boy, it stunk in there.

                              KAREN
                 I believe it.  You've ruined a nine-
                 hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, went real nice with that twelve
                 gauge, too.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, why in the world would someone
                 like you ever become a federal marshall?

                              KAREN
                 The idea of going after guys like you
                 appealed to me.

                              FOLEY
                 Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even
                 though I've been celibate lately, I'm
                 not gonna force myself on you.  I've
                 never done that in my life.

                              KAREN
                 You wouldn't have time anyway.  We
                 come to a roadblock, they'll run the
                 car, find out in five seconds who it
                 belongs to.

                              FOLEY
                 If they get set up in time, which I
                 doubt.  And even if they do they'll be
                 looking for a buncha little Latin
                 fellas, not a big black guy driving a
                 Ford.

                              KAREN
                 Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass
                 like this.

     More bumps.  Then picking up speed as the road smooths out.

                              FOLEY
                 Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy.
                 Back when we jailed together, he'd
                 call his sister every week without
                 fail.  She's a born-again Christian,
                 does bookkeeping for a televangelist.
                 Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins,
                 tells her about whatever bank he
                 happened to rob.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy.  That's his given name?

                              FOLEY
                      (woops, beat)
                 One I gave him, yeah.

                              KAREN
                 So, what's your name?  It'll be in the
                 paper tomorrow anyway.

                              FOLEY
                 Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of
                 me.

                              KAREN
                 Why, are you famous?

                              FOLEY
                 Time I was convicted in California?
                 FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than
                 anyone in the computer.

                              KAREN
                 How many was that?

                              FOLEY
                 Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I
                 started when I was eighteen, driving
                 for my Uncle Cully and his partner,
                 Gus.  They go into a bank this one
                 time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter
                 to get the tellers and breaks his leg.
                 All three of us ended up in Angola.

                              KAREN
                 That's funny.

                              FOLEY
                 I thought so, too.

                              KAREN
                 It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on
                 the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 I believe you would have.  Another fall,
                 I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I
                 don't mean the place next door where
                 some of Nixon's people went.

                              KAREN
                 I know the difference.  You were in
                 Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary.
                 I've delivered people there.  So
                 basically you've spent half your life
                 in prison.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I
                 do a full thirty years, no time off.
                 Can you imagine looking at that?

                              KAREN
                 I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.

     He looks at her, then looks away as we...

                 You don't seem all that scared.

                              KAREN
                 Of course I am.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't act like it.

                              KAREN
                 What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I
                 don't think it would help much.
                      (then)
                 I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy,
                 and wait for you to screw up.

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.

                              KAREN
                 You were married?  All those falls,
                 I'm surprised you had time.

                              FOLEY
                 It was just a year, give or take a few
                 days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't
                 get along or anything.  We had fun, we
                 just didn't have that... that thing,
                 you know?  That spark, you know what I
                 mean?  You gotta have that.

                              KAREN
                      (thinking)
                 Uh-huh.

                              FOLEY
                 We still talk, though.

                 Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot
                 like a dog, it'll be in the street,
                 not off a goddamn fence.

                              KAREN
                 You must see yourself as some kind of
                 Clyde Barrow.

     And for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on

                 Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm.
                 You ever see pictures of him, the way
                 he wore his hat?  You could tell he
                 had that don't-give-a-shit air about
                 him.

                              KAREN
                 I don't recall his hat, but I've seen
                 pictures of him lying dead, shot by
                 Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't
                 have his shoes on?

                              FOLEY
                 Is that right?

                              KAREN
                 They put a hundred and eighty-seven
                 bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker
                 and the car they were driving.  Bonnie
                 was eating a sandwich.

                              FOLEY
                 You're full of interesting facts, aren't
                 you?

                              KAREN
                 It was May, 1934, near Gibsland,

                 think of her name.

                              KAREN

                 Yeah, I liked her in that movie about

                 Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where
                 Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get
                 shot?  I remember thinking at the time
                 it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you
                 have to.

                 were in that car -- eating a sandwich --

                 You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder --
                 say we met under different circumstances
                 and got to talking, say you were in a
                 bar and I came up to you -- I wonder
                 what would happen.

                              KAREN
                 Nothing.

                              FOLEY
                 I mean if you didn't know who I was.

                              KAREN
                 You'd probably tell me.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just saying I think if we met under
                 different circumstances...

                 You have to be kidding.

                 Yeah...

     They lie there a moment, think about that as we hear THE CAR
     SLOWING DOWN, coasting, then bumping along the shoulder of the
     road to a stop.

                              KAREN
                 I never thought it made sense, though,
                 the way they got together so quick.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.

                              KAREN
                 I mean, romantically.

                      (then)

                              BUDDY
                 That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's
                 waiting with the other car.

                              FOLEY
                 Okay, honey, come on out of there.

     Karen pushes off, rolls from her right side to her left, brings
     up her Sig Sauer in both hands to put it on them, both standing
     in the opening, in the dark, but right there.

                              KAREN
                 Get your hands up and turn around.
                 Now.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     Foley brings the lid down, he and Buddy moving in opposite
     directions as she begins firing from the inside...

     As Buddy and Foley hook up again in front of the car.  We can
     see they're beneath an overpass.  Foley stares at the trunk.

                              BUDDY
                 We may as well leave her, we're leaving
                 the car and we gotta leave her some place
                 anyway, what's the difference where?

                              FOLEY
                 She's coming with us.

     Foley walks to the passenger seat, reaches in the window.

                              BUDDY
                 Jesus Christ, what were you doing in
                 there?

                              FOLEY
                 Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd
                 like to know who she is.

     Foley takes her wallet, looks at her driver's licence photo.

                              BUDDY
                 I already looked.  Her name is Karen
                 Sisco.  Like the Cisco Kid only spelled
                 different, S-i-s-c-o.

     A sheriff's green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep
     to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment
     of the overpass.  When the road quiets down, Foley moves to the
     trunk and bangs on it once with his fist.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen?  Be a good girl now, you hear?
                 Now, I'm gonna open the--

     Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're putting holes in your car!

     He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him.
     He settles down, then...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 We're not leaving you.  I'm gonna open
                 the trunk enough for you to throw the
                 gun out.  Okay?  You shoot -- Buddy's
                 got your shotgun, says he'll shoot
                 back if you do and I can't stop him.
                 So it's up to you.

     Foley puts his hand out and Buddy, still looking at him funny,
     gives him the keys.

                              VOICE
                 Hey!

     Coming from somewhere above them.

                              VOICE (CONT'D)
                 It's me, Glenn.

     Foley steps out into the open, Buddy close behind him.  They
     look up to see a figure, head and shoulders against the evening
     sky, leaning on the concrete overpass rail.  We can see his
     long blond hair falling beside his face, now half-concealed
     behind dark sunglasses.

                              GLENN
                 Hey, Jack, good to see you, man.  The
                 fuck're you guys shooting at?

     Foley looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 Do we need him?

                              BUDDY
                 The green-and-whites saw us.  One of
                 'em starts thinking, what's that car
                 doing there?  Ties it to the break and
                 turns around...

     Foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were
                 somebody else.

                              GLENN
                 Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since
                 Lompoc.  What's going on?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, nuthin'.

     Foley shakes his head, then walks back to the Ford and bangs
     on the trunk.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You coming out?

     Foley sticks the key in the lock as Buddy steps up to the trunk
     and racks the pump on the shotgun.  Foley leans close to the
     metal.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You hear that?

     He turns the key and raises the lid.  Karen, bunched in there,
     extends her arm, her hand holding the Sig Sauer by the barrel.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     "Jack."  Buddy gives him another funny look.

     EXT. TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT

     As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen
     Audi that reads "GONE TO GET GAS."

                              FOLEY
                 Have your clothes cleaned and send me
                 the bill.

     Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade,
     move through the scrub.  Glenn leans against the car, flashers
     blinking.

                              KAREN
                 I'll send it to you at Glades.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a
                 sewer?

                              FOLEY
                 Take your sunglasses off.

                              GLENN
                 I see better with them on.

                              FOLEY
                 You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw
                 'em off the overpass while they're
                 still on your head.

     Glenn shrugs, takes them off and sticks them in his jeans.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Wait in the car.

                              GLENN
                 You're in civilization now, man, ease
                 up.

                              FOLEY
                 I'd like you to go wait in the car.
                 How's that?  Take her with you and put
                 her in back.

                              GLENN
                 In the trunk?

                              FOLEY
                 The backseat.

     Foley stares at him, waiting.  Glenn motions to Karen...

                              GLENN
                 Come on.  I have to do what I'm told.

     She walks past Foley without looking at him.

                              FOLEY
                 Wait a minute.  Let me have your
                 raincoat.
                      (looks at Buddy)
                 Somebody forgot to bring me clean
                 clothes.

                              BUDDY
                 I brought 'em, they're back at Glades
                 in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take
                 her car.

                              KAREN
                 You can blame me if you want.  I don't
                 mind.

     He doesn't say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat, folds
     it up, then throws it at Foley's feet.

                              GLENN
                 Here you are, sir.

     Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out, puts them back
     on and takes Karen by the arm.

                              BUDDY
                 What's wrong with you?

     Karen looks over at Foley, then ducks her head and gets in the
     backseat.

                              FOLEY
                 Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll
                 never know.

                              BUDDY
                 How 'bout the score was his idea to
                 begin with?

                              FOLEY
                 His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's
                 got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you
                 and me figured the whole thing out.

     Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform,
     all of them caked with muck.

                              BUDDY
                 You're pulling at it.  Here...

     He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up, takes the guard
     shirt in his two hands and rips it open, popping buttons and
     tearing the shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know why, but every time he
                 opens his mouth I want to punch him
                 out.

                              BUDDY
                 He ain't the problem, Jack.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You wanna pull your head outta your
                 ass and tell me why we're bringing her
                 with us?

     INT. CAR - SAME

     As Karen watches Glenn get into the car, sees him as the dome
     light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door.
     He half turns, laying his arm along the top of the seats, runs
     his hand through his hair...

                              GLENN
                 ...if he thinks he can talk to me like
                 this.  Shit, I don't even know what I
                 need them for.

     Karen leans forward to have a look, sees Foley and Buddy against
     the dark foliage.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 I got a big score lined up up north.
                 They wouldn't even know about it, it
                 wasn't for me.  I could do it right
                 now myself, except it's so fucking
                 cold up there in January--

                              KAREN
                 Glenn?

     His head turns so that we can see his designer shades.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You don't remember me, do you?

                              GLENN
                      (beat)
                 It couldn't have been out at Glades,
                 if that's what you're thinking.  I was
                 never out there.

                              KAREN
                 No, that's not what I'm thinking.

     He raises his hand, strokes his hair away from his face.

                              GLENN
                 But you're sure we've met, huh?

                              KAREN
                 Last fall, I drove you from the Palm
                 Beach county jail to the federal
                 courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn
                 Michaels.
                      (then)
                 I never forget anyone I've cuffed and
                 shackled.

     He doesn't move or say a word, staring at her now like he's
     been turned to stone.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Let's think for a minute, Glenn, see if
                 we can work this out...

     He turns away, all the way around to look straight ahead...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Do we have a gun in the car?

                              GLENN
                 I remember you now.  Shit.

                              KAREN
                 Foley's not going to make it.  And if
                 he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.

     She touches his shoulder and he jumps.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Look, I can understand if you and Foley
                 are close.

                              GLENN
                 We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--

                              KAREN
                 Wait.  Have you helped him, Glenn?  At
                 this point, technically, I doubt you
                 could be charged with aiding a fugitive.
                 So you still have a choice.  You can
                 help him and risk going down again,
                 get cuffed and shackled, hope to God
                 you pull a reasonable judge, not some
                 hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it
                 another way...

     She pauses.  He turns and looks at her.

                              GLENN
                 Like how?

     EXT. OVERPASS - SAME

     Foley watches a car pass on the highway.

                              BUDDY
                 You want to take her to my place and
                 get cleaned up?  You come out of the
                 bathroom with your after-shave on and
                 she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?

                              FOLEY
                 I want to talk to her again, that's
                 all.  See what would happen under, you
                 know, normal circumstances.

                              BUDDY
                 You're too late, Jack.

     Foley doesn't say anything.  Just takes a deep breath as we
     HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over...

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 He wants to get out of here and I don't
                 blame him.

     They start towards the car.  Then stop and watch as it takes
     off, tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement.  Their backs
     to us, they stand there watching the tailights until they're
     out of sight down the turnpike, neither of them saying a word.

     We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER...

     CUT TO: A CORRIDOR IN LOMPOC FPC

     As Maurice Miller and his "man" -- a big black bulk named HIMEY
     -- strut purposefully up the hall.  They step into...

     THE PRISON LIBRARY

     Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big
     coffee-table book called "THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH."

                              MAURICE
                 Dick.  My man.

     Ripley looks up as Maurice and Himey come strolling into the
     library, sit down on either side of a now very anxious Ripley.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I got your fishies for you.

     He sets a small Ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the
     table.

                              RIPLEY
                      (reaches for them)
                 Thank you...

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls them back)
                 Not so fast, Dick.
                      (off Ripley's look)
                 Starting now, there's gonna be an across
                 the board cost a living increase.

                              RIPLEY
                 What?

                              MAURICE
                 Year ago, I come in here on credit
                 card fraud, but after I shanked that
                 loudmouth pussy on the yard the other
                 day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone
                 way the fuck up.

                              RIPLEY
                 I think it's Dunn & Bradstreet.  But
                 then, I could be wrong...

                              MAURICE
                 Whoever.  The point is, prices are
                 goin' up, too.  Better get your little
                 black book out, Richard.  We got some
                 business to talk about.

     Ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Let's start with the fish.  They was
                 two grand, but now they's three.

     Ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you
                 asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.

                              RIPLEY
                      (writing)
                 Well, I need that...

                              MAURICE
                 ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an
                 even three c's.

                              VOICE
                 Hey.

     They all look to where...

     JACK FOLEY

     Sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of
     some kind.  Himey gives him a mean stare.  Foley points to a
     sign that says "QUIET PLEASE."

                              FOLEY
                 Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't
                 you guys read?

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 There a problem, Foley?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah.

     Foley shuts the big book -- CHILTON'S AUTO REPAIR.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the
                 dumbest fucking shakedown in the history
                 of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred
                 bucks for a pillow?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              RIPLEY
                 Sounds high, doesn't it?

                              FOLEY
                 Must be a real soft pillow.

                              MAURICE
                 Faux goose down.

                              RIPLEY
                 Still...

                              FOLEY
                 How much for your company at chow?

                              MAURICE
                 Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.

                              FOLEY
                 I bet.  How much?

                              MAURICE
                 Another C.

     Foley shakes his head, turns to Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this
                 guy to fuck off.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?  Well, I uhhh...

                              FOLEY
                 First of all, if he kills you, he's
                 not gonna get any more money out of
                 you.

     Ripley looks at Maurice: Good point.

                              MAURICE
                 Man doesn't have to get killed.  He
                 could accidentally fall on something
                 sharp, like a shiv.  Or my dick.

     Ripley turns back to Foley now: Also a good point.

                              FOLEY
                 You stick anything in this guy, Snoop,
                 they transfer his ass outta here
                 faster'n you can throw a fight, and
                 you still end up with nothing.

     Ripley nods, takes this in.

                              MAURICE
                 This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why
                 don't you go on out to the yard, have
                 yourself a smoke?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't smoke.

                              HIMEY
                      (slowly rising)
                 You heard the man.  Go on outta here.

     Foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.

                              MAURICE
                 Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine.
                 He's ranked number thirty-two in the
                 federal prison system.

                              FOLEY
                      (looking at Himey)
                 Thirty-two outta what, twenty?

     Himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock
     Foley in the head when...

     ...in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand,
     like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual
     into Himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending
     his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor
     back-first with a loud thud.

     Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A
     WHISTLE.  They all freeze, look to...

     A PRISONER AT ANOTHER TABLE

     Who nods towards the door.  We PAN OVER just as A GUARD APPEARS,
     takes in the scene as a dazed Himey slowly pulls himself up,
     covers his now bleeding nose.

                              GUARD
                 What's going on here?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, you know, reading's funnamental
                 an' shit, we just excited.

                              GUARD
                 Clear outta here.

     The guard exits.  Maurice and Foley are still staring at each
     other.

                              RIPLEY
                 Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the
                 fish thing?

                              MAURICE
                      (looks at Foley)
                 Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

     He pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into
     Ripley's open hand.  Maurice then squeezes Ripley's hand into a
     fist, crushing the fish.  He taps his fist to Ripley's.

                              RIPLEY
                 That's how you do it.

     Maurice gives Foley a last look, starts out of the room with
     Himey.  Ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at
     Foley.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thanks for your help.

                              FOLEY
                 Any time.

     We hear a PHONE RING and then...

     CUT TO: MAURICE MILLER'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - (NOW)

     As Maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, fool.  Stick and jab.

     A frisbee whizzes past the television.  We hear A DOG YELP OS.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Hey!  Watch that shit!

     Maurice's girlfriend MOSELLE - about thirty, sleepy-eyed, in a
     green bathrobe - picks the frisbee up off the floor as THE PHONE
     RINGS AWAY on the bedside table right next to Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                      (calls OS)
                 Tuffy.  C'mere, boy...

                              MAURICE
                 You gonna answer the phone?

                              MOSELLE
                 What for?  It's not for me.

     Maurice watches as Moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a
     little wire-haired terrier, but it just bounces off the dog's
     head.

                              MOSELLE (CONT'D)
                 Bad dog.

                              MAURICE
                      (scoops up the dog)
                 Moselle, the fuck are you doing to my
                 little Tuffy?

     He lovingly nuzzles the dog like it's his child.

                              MOSELLE
                 I'm trainin' Tuffy, so he can be on a
                 Kal Kan commercial, make us some extra
                 money.

     He looks at her.

                              MAURICE
                 That's the dumbest thing I heard in my
                 life.  Everybody knows Kal Kan doesn't
                 pay for shit.  You gonna get a gig,
                 it's gotta be for one of the big three:
                 Science Diet, Iams or that Cycle shit
                 for the fat dogs.  Now answer the fuckin
                 phone.

     She comes over, picks up the phone.

                              MOSELLE
                 Hello?
                      (hands it to Maurice)
                 For you.

                              MAURICE
                      (takes it)
                 This is me.

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - GAS STATION - NIGHT

     An antsy Glenn with his shades on talks on the phone.

                              GLENN
                 Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.

     INTERCUTTING GLENN & MAURICE:

                              MAURICE
                 Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a
                 them psychic friends.  I was just
                 thinkin' about you.

     Glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black Lincoln
     Town Car and jogs to the john.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to
                 Detroit and need a place to crash.

                              MAURICE
                 You crazy, come up here?  It's fuckin
                 one degree outside.

                              GLENN
                 I wanna talk to you about a job.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.

                              GLENN
                 I can't really go into it right now.
                 I'll just tell you it's someone big.

                              MAURICE
                 Someone?  Gimme a hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's a guy you know.

                              MAURICE
                 Gimme another hint.

                              GLENN
                 It's Richard Ripley.

     Maurice doesn't say a word.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 You there?

                              MAURICE
                 Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here.
                 Question is, why aren't you here?

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - SOMEWHERE IN FLORIDA - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy hurry up the front steps.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just saying she wasn't scared.

                              BUDDY
                 Cause she had her hand on her gun the
                 whole time, waiting to make her move.

     Buddy opens the door, looks at Foley.

                              FOLEY
                 You're just jealous it was me in the
                 trunk with her and not you.

                              BUDDY
                 You're right.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A "hideout."  Not much in the way of furnishings.  Foley follows
     Buddy inside, watches as he bolts the door.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing I'm gonna do is get all
                 this mud off me.

     Foley starts for the bathroom.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I've been dreaming about a hot bath
                 for the last six months.  Soak the prison
                 off me.

                              BUDDY
                 There's some lilac oil, you want some,
                 a vanilla candle under the sink.

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, man.

                              BUDDY
                 There's something about a nice hot
                 bath, transforms a person.  It's not
                 just about opening up your pores, know
                 what I mean?  There's just something
                 about the heat and the wet that's
                 calming you know?  Settles me in a way
                 that I really can't articulate.

                              FOLEY
                 I know exactly what you mean.  It's
                 just a feeling.
                      (beat)
                 You know, I could go for some wine
                 tonight.

                              BUDDY
                 There's a store around the corner,
                 I'll be right back.

                              FOLEY
                 Sounds great.

     Foley goes into the bathroom.  A moment later WE HEAR THE BATH
     RUNNING.

     INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

     As Buddy leaves the apartment, starts down the hall, KAREN STEPS
     INTO FRAME, watches as he disappears down the stairs.  Gun drawn,
     she then moves towards the apartment.

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     As Foley undresses, picks up a candle off the sink and smells
     it.  He notices his nude image in the mirror and checks himself
     out.

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     As Karen slips the door.  She looks around, HEARS THE WATER
     RUNNING.

     She racks the slide on her gun, snicks off the safety and starts
     for the bathroom.  Suddenly, the water is turned off.  She stops
     where she is.  She then moves a careful step at a time towards
     the open doorway.

     Gradually the tub comes into view, beginning with Foley's feet
     resting crossed on the other end, then the middle of the tub,
     then she's in the doorway, looking down at...

     Foley, lying there in the tub, his eyes closed.  Karen cuts her
     eyes down the length of him, taking a moment here to check him
     out, long enough for Foley to open his eyes and grab her hand,
     the one holding the gun.

                              FOLEY
                 Hey.

     They look at each other a moment.  He then pulls her down to
     him and kisses her.  She kisses him back.  He then pulls her
     into the tub with him as we now hear...

                              MARSHALL SISCO (VO)
                 Karen...?

     CUT TO: KAREN

     As she opens her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 What?

     REVEAL: A HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Flowers everywhere.  Karen -- bruises on her face -- lies in
     bed.  Her father, Marshall, sits on the chair beside her.

                              MARSHALL
                 You were talking in your sleep.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 What'd I say?

                              MARSHALL
                 "Hey, yourself."

                              KAREN
                 Huh.

     We hear A KNOCK at the door.  They look to where Special Agent
     DANIEL BURDON -- black, forties, expensive suit -- stands in
     the doorway, file in one hand.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hello, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                      (to Marshall)
                 Daniel Burdon, FBI.

                              MARSHALL
                 Marshall Sisco.  Karen's dad.

                              BURDON
                 You mind please waiting outside.  We
                 have some business to do here.

     Marshall looks at him a moment.  Then, to Karen...

                              MARSHALL
                 I need to go to the john anyway.

     Burdon waits for Marshall to walk out, then sits down.

                              KAREN
                 I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.

                              BURDON
                 That's nice of you to offer, Karen,
                 but I got all the help I can use right
                 now.  Instead, let's talk about how
                 you got the bump on your head.

                              KAREN
                      (indicates file)
                 Isn't that my report you're holding
                 onto?

                              BURDON
                 Yes, but I want to hear you tell it.
                 Starting with when you tried to grab
                 the wheel -- where was this?

                              KAREN
                 Coming to the Okeechobee exit...

     And now we see it...

     INSIDE THE CAR

     Going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars...

                              KAREN
                 Take the next exit.

                              GLENN
                 What am I supposed to do now?

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, take the exit.

                              GLENN
                 No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna
                 turn myself in.

     She reaches over and grabs the wheel.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 The fuck are you doing?!

     He hits the brakes.  The car goes off the road, down the grade,
     the abutment coming right at us as we go back to...

     THE HOSPITAL ROOM

     As Burdon sets the file down, sits back now.

                              KAREN
                 The next thing I knew, the paramedics
                 were taking me out the car.

     Burdon looks at Karen a moment, then...

                              BURDON
                 There's a couple of points I keep
                 wondering about have to do with the
                 two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is
                 it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I
                 swear the man must've robbed two hundred
                 banks in his time.

                              KAREN
                 Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't
                 remember how many he robbed.

                              BURDON
                 You talked to him?

                              KAREN
                 In the trunk, yeah?

                              BURDON
                 What'd you talk about?

                              KAREN
                 Oh... different things, prison, movies.

                              BURDON
                 This fella holds you hostage, you talk
                 about movies?

                              KAREN
                 It was an unusual experience.

                              BURDON
                 Foley made me think of that fella Carl
                 Tillman, the one you were seeing, it
                 turns out the same time he was doing
                 banks.  You recall that?

                              KAREN
                 When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't
                 know he robbed banks.

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe
                 he did, and I told you.  So you had to
                 at least suspect him.

                              KAREN
                 And what happened to Carl?

                              BURDON
                 The time came, you shot him.  But you
                 didn't shoot Foley or the guy with
                 him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
                 and you let them throw you in the trunk.
                 Okay, now you got your Sig in your
                 hand.  You say in the report you
                 couldn't turn around, he had you pinned
                 down.  But when the trunk opened, how
                 come you didn't cap the two guys then?

                              KAREN
                 Is that what you would've done?

                              BURDON
                 You say in the report Glenn didn't
                 have a gun, but you let him get away,
                 too.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel, what do you work on most of
                 the time, fraud?  Go after crooked
                 bookkeepers.

                              BURDON
                 Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen
                 years, on all kinds of investigations.

                              KAREN
                 Have you ever shot a man?  How many
                 times have you been primary through
                 the door?

                              BURDON
                 I have to qualify, is that it?

                              KAREN
                 You have to know what you're talking
                 about.

     We hear CHUCKLING OS.  Burdon glances at the doorway where we
     see Marshall now standing, enjoying this.

                              BURDON
                 We'll talk another time, Karen.  All
                 right?  I'd like to know why Foley put
                 you in that second car when he didn't
                 need you any more.

                              KAREN
                 You'll have to ask him.

                              BURDON
                 Sounds to me like he liked having you
                 around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr.
                 Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Agent Burdon.

     Marshall waits for him to walk out...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 The white man's Burdon.  That's what
                 everybody calls him in Miami.  The
                 Metro-Dade guys.  He's got a knack for
                 pissing people off.

     She's not listening.  He sits down, takes her hand...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 What are you thinking about?

                              KAREN
                 The Sig Sauer you got me for my
                 birthday.

                              MARSHALL
                 Tell you what, you're a good girl, you
                 might get another one for Christmas.

     She looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 I'll get it back when I get Foley.

     EXT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

     A dozen GERIATRIC RESIDENTS sit on chairs out front as Buddy
     climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm,
     newspaper under the other.  An old woman comes out the door as
     Buddy opens it and squints at him.

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Oh--  Are you delivering the oxygen?

                              BUDDY
                 Uh, no, ma'am.  Sorry.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Buddy's REAL apartment, not the one Karen pictured in her dream.
     This one's nicer, with a view of the beach.  Jack stands on the
     balcony going through KAREN'S PURSE.

     He pulls out her wallet, checks out her driver's licence photo.
     He does the same with her gym I.D. card.  He finds her address
     book and opens it up.  A photo of her father slips out.  Jack
     examines it a moment, then flips through the book.

     He stares at something in her bag a moment, then reaches in
     and comes up with her us Marshal I.D.  He slips it open and
     studies the badge and the picture opposite.

     He holds on to it, looks out at the ocean, but really sees...

     THE OPEN TRUNK OF THE CAR - LAST NIGHT

     As Karen gets out, saying...

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     BACK IN THE APARTMENT

     Foley turns away from the view as Buddy walks in, sets the
     grocery bag down on the coffee table.

                              BUDDY
                 You made the front page.

     He holds up the newspaper so that Foley can see his picture on
     the front page: an unflattering mug shot that doesn't look all
     that much like him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They pass this picture around you can
                 go anywhere you want, nobody'll know
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't feeling my best that day.
                 I'd just drawn thirty to life.

                              BUDDY
                 Maybe this'll make you feel better.

     Buddy reaches into the bag, tosses Foley a NEW ZIPPO.

                              FOLEY
                 Thanks.

     Foley catches the lighter, immediately begins playing with it.
     He looks at the paper on the coffee table as Buddy sits down,
     pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag.

                              BUDDY
                 Paper says there's ten grand each on
                 you, Chino and Lulu.

                              FOLEY
                 Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?

                              BUDDY
                 Just that she got away.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but what happened after she drove
                 off with Glenn?

                              BUDDY
                 You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most
                 likely, he's on his way to Detroit,
                 where we should be.

     Foley walks back out on to the balcony, looks at the contents of
     Karen's bag spread out on the table.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You realize what you're doing?  Worrying
                 about a person that works in law
                 enforcement.  You want to sit down and
                 have cocktails with a girl that tried
                 to shoot you.  You hear what I'm saying?

     Foley holds up the picture of Marshall Sisco.

                              FOLEY
                 Think this old guy is her boyfriend?
                 It's the only picture she carries.

                              BUDDY
                 Am I going to Detroit by myself?

     Foley picks up her drivers licence photo.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Longer we hang around down here, Jack,
                 better chance there is either Glenn's
                 gonna fuck up the whole score, or we
                 gonna get busted, or both.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll leave first thing in the morning.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Right on a marina.  Boats bobbing on the water.

                              MARSHALL (VO)
                 Is this Foley?

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S CONDO - DAY

     Marshall sits in his chair holding up a newspaper as Karen hands
     him a drink.  She stares at the photograph.

                              KAREN
                 He doesn't even look like that.

                              MARSHALL
                 No?

                              KAREN
                 No, he looks a lot...

     She realizes Marshall's watching her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Different.

     The doorbell RINGS.  She ignores his look, gets up.  Walks to
     the door and opens it to reveal RAY NICOLET, boots, leather
     jacket, etc.  Cowboy Cop.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Hi, Ray.

                              RAY
                 You look great.  Your dad taking good
                 care of you?

                              KAREN
                 He took the week off so we'd have time
                 together.  So far he's worked on his
                 boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.

     Marshall gets up, shakes his head.

                              RAY
                 I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.

                              MARSHALL
                 Likewise.

                              KAREN
                 Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force,
                 working on the prison break.

                              MARSHALL
                      (eyeing his T-shirt)
                 I see that.

     Ray turns to Karen, holding his jacket open to show the task
     force inscription on his T-shirt in red, the guy's .357 tucked
     into his waistband.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 In case no one knows what he does.
                 Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says,
                 "Undercover"?

                              RAY
                 No.  Course not.

                              KAREN
                      (changing the subject)
                 How's it going?

                              RAY
                 Great.  We got one of 'em.

     Karen looks at him.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

                              MARSHALL
                      (before he can answer)
                 Off a tip?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in
                 this hobo camp out by the airport,
                 called the number--

                              MARSHALL
                 I knew it, soon as I saw they were
                 offering a reward.

     She grabs Nicolet by the arm.

                              KAREN
                 Was it Foley?

     Marshall looks at her.

                              RAY
                 Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the
                 Cubans.  Linares.

                              KAREN
                 Oh...

                              RAY
                 We went out there, full SWAT, two
                 choppers, the whole bit, but Linares
                 started shooting anyway.  We put him
                 down, but somehow Chirino got away.

                              MARSHALL
                 Did you pay the guy the reward?

                              RAY
                 Yeah, as soon as we got back.

                              KAREN
                 Foley hadn't been there?

     Her father gives her a look.

                              RAY
                 This place was strictly Cuban.  If
                 Foley had a ride he must have his own
                 agenda. He seems to be the only one
                 knows what he's doing.

     THE PHONE RINGS.  Marshall moves to it.

                              MARSHALL
                 Hello?
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.
                      (hands her the phone)
                 For you.

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

     CUT TO: FOLEY ON THE PHONE - DAY

     On the balcony.  Flipping through a copy of Vogue while Buddy
     watches television inside.

                              FOLEY
                 Hi.

     INTERCUTTING KAREN & FOLEY - DAY

     Karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as Ray
     drones on.

                              FOLEY
                 You know who this is?

                              KAREN
                 Yes.

     She walks out to her father's balcony now.

                              FOLEY
                 I just wanted to see if you're okay,
                 make sure Glenn didn't hurt you or,
                 you know, anything.

                              MARSHALL
                 Something I've been wondering, Ray...

     Marshall picks up the newspaper...

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 It says in the headline, "I slept with
                 a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."
                 She lives in Little Havana, her
                 husband's out of town working when one
                 of the escapees shows up at her door...

     She closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you get this number?

                              FOLEY
                 Who was it answered the phone?

                              KAREN
                 None of your business.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm just worried maybe I'm not old
                 enough for you.

                              KAREN
                 That's my dad.

                              FOLEY
                 Really.  He has a cop's face.

                              KAREN
                 How do you know?  Wait-- you have my
                 wallet.

                              FOLEY
                 And your gun.

                              KAREN
                 Think I could have them back?

                              FOLEY
                 How do we do that?

                              KAREN
                 Let's see.  You could come on by my
                 dad's place, drop 'em off.

                              FOLEY
                 Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the
                 S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.

     Foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's
     been looking for: an ad for Defiance perfume.

                              KAREN
                 There's a guy here on the task force
                 right now.  Maybe I should put him on
                 the phone, let you two work it out.

                              FOLEY
                 You won't do that.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              FOLEY
                 Because you're having too much fun.

     She doesn't know what to say to that.  Foley smells the ad.

     INSIDE THE HOUSE

                              MARSHALL
                 ...She fixes him pork chops and rice,
                 the next thing you know they're making
                 love on the sofa.  She says he was
                 very gentle.

                              RAY
                 I spoke to her.  The guy told her he
                 missed his little girl and she felt
                 sorry for him.

                              MARSHALL
                 That's how you score now?

     ON THE PATIO:

     Karen looks inside at her father talking with Ray Nicolet.

                              KAREN
                 My dad's retired.  He was a Private
                 Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to
                 work for him.

                              FOLEY
                 I can just picture that, a cute girl
                 like you following slip-and-fall and
                 whiplash cheaters.

                              KAREN
                 Something I've been wondering, what
                 ever happened to your Uncle Cully?

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  You think he might tell you where
                 I am?

                              KAREN
                 Unless you wanna tell me.

                              FOLEY
                 He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years
                 before he came out and died not too
                 long after in Charity Hospital, I think
                 trying to make up for all the good
                 times he'd missed.
                      (then)
                 That's not gonna be me.

                              KAREN
                 One last score, that the idea?  Move
                 to some island.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm partial to mountains myself.  But
                 if you like islands, we'll make it an
                 island.

                              KAREN
                 Whatta you mean we'll make it an island?

                              FOLEY
                 I just thought maybe you and me could--

     Buddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles Foley.

                              BUDDY
                 Who you talking to?

                              KAREN
                 Is that Buddy?

     Foley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone.  He looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY
                 What?!

                              BUDDY
                 You better come see this.

     INT. MARSHALL'S CONDO - DAY

     As Karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up,
     opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room.

                              RAY
                 The woman also said he stole her
                 husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol,
                 and some of his clothes.

                              MARSHALL
                 So the woman's married.  She goes to
                 bed with this prison escapee because
                 he misses his little girl and then
                 tells the world about it.  But you
                 don't reveal her name, you protect
                 her.  It sounds like you're saying
                 it's okay as long as her husband doesn't
                 find out about it.  Like the guy who
                 cheats on his wife, saying what she
                 doesn't know won't hurt her.

                              KAREN
                 Dad.

     He looks over at her now.  Gives her an innocent look.

                              MARSHALL
                 What?

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at
     the hobo camp.  We catch a glimpse of RAY NICOLET, GUN IN HIS
     WAISTBAND, STICKING HIS CHEST OUT FOR THE CAMERA.

     Foley shakes his head as they show a shot of Lulu's body covered
     with a sheet.

                              FOLEY
                 Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

                              BUDDY
                 He's running for his life, he doesn't
                 give a shit about you.

                              FOLEY
                 He's gotta know by now that I gave him
                 up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna
                 try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele,
                 see what she knows.

                              BUDDY
                 He knows where she lives?

     Foley doesn't answer.  Buddy mutes the set.  Turns to Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 We were talking one time, drinking
                 rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how
                 she worked for a magician.  Chino got
                 interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How
                 does he saw the woman in half?  He
                 wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at
                 her if she ever came to visit.

                              BUDDY
                 So call her up.  Tell her don't talk
                 to any Cubans.

                              FOLEY
                 Her phone's probably tapped.

                              BUDDY
                 And you know they're gonna have some
                 people watching the hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

     EXT. MARSHALL SISCO'S BOAT - DAY

     Karen stands there with her car keys and purse as Marshall paints
     the trim on the boat.

                              MARSHALL
                 Remember, pay attention to how she
                 talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it
                 right, she'll tell you things she
                 wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you
                 think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell
                 her about being in the trunk with him,
                 in the dark for half an hour, and see
                 how she takes it.  If she's in on it,
                 what does she get for all the
                 aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I
                 bet nothing.  So she still likes him
                 enough to stick her neck out.  You
                 think that's possible?  What kind of
                 guy is he?

                              KAREN
                 He's pretty laid back, confident.

                              MARSHALL
                 He remind you of that guy, Tillman?

                              KAREN
                 Not at all.

                              MARSHALL
                 But you know he's dirty and you still
                 wanna see him again.

                              KAREN
                 I want to bust his ass, put him in
                 shackles.

                              MARSHALL
                 Maybe.  But you're also curious about
                 the man.  Twice last night you asked
                 your married boyfriend Nicolet about
                 him.  You were concerned, but you didn't
                 want to show it.

                              KAREN
                 My married boyfriend - setting him up
                 with that news story so you could talk
                 about infidelity.  I couldn't believe
                 it.

                              MARSHALL
                 You like the wild ones, don't you?
                 Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You
                 know, I've always said there's a thin
                 line between the cowboy cops and the
                 armed robbers, all those guys that
                 love to pack.

                              KAREN
                 Foley kidnapped me.

                              MARSHALL
                 Yeah, but you talked all the way from
                 GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more
                 like a first date than a kidnapping.
                 
     She gives him a look.  He goes back to his painting.

                              MARSHALL (CONT'D)
                 Go talk to the ex-wife.

     INT. ADELE DELISI'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass-topped
     dining table and turns on the window air-conditioner when THE
     PHONE RINGS.  She grabs it...

                              ADELE
                 Hi, this is Adele speaking.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - DAY

     Adele's neighbourhood.  Near the beach.  Chino on the phone.  He
     wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit...

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is this Adele?

                              ADELE (PHONE)
                 Yes, it is.

                              CHINO
                 Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.

     He hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in
     one of his pockets.  As he then starts off down the street, we
     can see the name "COLOR MY WORLD HOUSEPAINTING" on the back of
     the jumpsuit.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     Buddy drives.  Foley -- in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit --
     is beside him.  Buddy looks at him, shakes his head.

                              BUDDY
                 Nice disguise.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm a tourist.

                              BUDDY
                 You at least bring the gun?

                              FOLEY
                      (lifts straw bag)
                 In here with my suntan lotion and beach
                 towel.
                      (points)
                 That's her place.

     As they drive past, Buddy indicates a MAN on the steps out front,
     obviously FBI...

                              BUDDY
                 There.  You see the guy sitting on the
                 porch?  The old ladies and one guy?
                 You know they'll have a couple more in
                 a car somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                      (watching something
                       else)
                 Uh-huh...

     Buddy follows Foley's gaze to...

     ACROSS THE STREET

     As a car door opens and Karen Sisco gets out, rifles her purse
     for change.  She drops a quarter, Foley now watching as she
     bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh...

                              BUDDY
                 Oh, my.

     Foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under
     the car and grab it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you saw her.  That's all you
                 get.

     They watch as she walks to the Normandie and shows the YOUNG
     AGENT her ID...

                              FOLEY
                 I guess Adele's in good hands.

                              BUDDY
                 Sure looks that way.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 Let's go to Detroit.

                              BUDDY
                 Now you're talkin'.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADELE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Adele has the chain on the door, talks to Karen through the
     narrow opening.

                              ADELE
                 You were both in the trunk?  Together?

                              KAREN
                 From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I
                 left with Glenn.

     Karen watches Adele's face in the opening, freshly made up,
     heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss.

                              KAREN
                 The FBI didn't tell you I was with
                 them?

                              ADELE
                 They didn't tell me anything, they
                 asked questions.

                              KAREN
                 But you know what I'm talking about,
                 don't you?  About Glenn, don't you,
                 and the second car?

                              ADELE
                 I know a Glenn.

     She thinks a moment.  The door closes and opens again, all the
     way.  Adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties,
     but no bra.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'm getting ready to go out.  You can
                 come in if you want, sit down for a
                 minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
                 
                              KAREN
                 No, thanks.

     She comes in, checks out the place.  She turns a chair from the
     glasstop table and sits down as Adele comes out of the
     kitchenette with a Diet Coke and packet of cigarettes.

                              ADELE
                 Those are cute shoes.  The kind of
                 jobs I get, I have to wear these killer
                 spikes, they ruin your feet.

     She walks away, comes back with an ashtray.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 When you were in the trunk with Jack...

     Karen waits, watches her light her cigarette.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?

                              KAREN
                 You mean, did he try to jump me?  No,
                 but he was kind of talkative.

                              ADELE
                 He gets that way when he's nervous
                 sometimes.

     Adele sits down at the other end of the table.

                              KAREN
                 You didn't visit him in prison.

                              ADELE
                 He didn't want me to.

                              KAREN
                 Why not?

                              ADELE
                 I don't know.  He was different after
                 he was sentenced, looking at thirty
                 years.  Said it depressed him every
                 time the younger cons called him an
                 old timer.

                              KAREN
                 But you spoke to him on the phone.

                              ADELE
                 He'd call every once in a while.

                              KAREN
                 He called the day he escaped.

                              ADELE
                 He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say
                 about me?  In the trunk?

                              KAREN
                      (beat, lies)
                 He said he wished the two of you could
                 start over, live a normal life.

                              ADELE
                 Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a
                 normal life is robbing banks.  It's
                 all he's ever done.

                              KAREN
                 Did you know that when you married
                 him?

                              ADELE
                 He said he was a card player.  I could
                 live with that.  I never knew he robbed
                 banks till he got busted with that car
                 that caught fire -- if you can imagine
                 something like that happening, comes
                 out of the bank and the car's on fire.
                 I did go see him in jail to tell him I
                 was filing for divorce.  He said,
                 "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.
                      (then)
                 He was fun, but never what you'd call
                 a real husband.

     Adele looks out the window.  Karen waits, looks to an end table
     where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere
     ten years back.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 I'll say one thing for Jack, he was
                 never ugly or mean, or drank too much.
                 He was very considerate, lights on or
                 off, if you know what I mean.

                              KAREN
                 Really.
                      (looking at the picture)
                 Hm.

     She realizes Adele is looking at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get
                 caught.  I'd like to get him before he
                 does something else, makes it worse on
                 himself.

                              ADELE
                 Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him
                 out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience.
                 Always has been.
                      (chuckles)
                 He tell you how they met?

     Karen shakes her head.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Jack came out of a bank he just robbed
                 in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen
                 car to start.  Battery was dead.  He
                 looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a
                 burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers
                 him a thousand dollars for a jump.
                 Turns out, Buddy was casing the same
                 bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy
                 says, I'll take the thousand, but we're
                 leaving in my car, not that piece of
                 shit you come in.
                      (then)
                 They musta robbed fifty banks together.

                              KAREN
                 Till they got busted.

                              ADELE
                 That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that
                 was on account of Buddy, for some
                 reason, decided to call his sister and
                 confess to a job before they'd done it
                 instead of after.  She called the FBI
                 and they both went down, ended up at
                 Lompoc.
                      (then)
                 I think Buddy felt kinda bad about
                 that.

                              KAREN
                 Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or
                 Glenn?

     Adele looks at Karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick
     raps on the door.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Adele?  You in there?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 I want to speak with you, please.

                              ADELE
                 Who is it?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 I talk to the guy you work for, Emil.
                 He tole me your number and where you
                 live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant
                 and would like to speak to you.

                              ADELE
                 Oh.  Uh-huh.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You did work for Emil, right?

                              ADELE
                 Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost
                 four years.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 You were his what, his box?

                              ADELE
                 His assistant.

     Karen looks at the door.  Something's wrong... through the glass
     bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement
     on the other side, someone doing something...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 You say you perform in the Miami area?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in
                 Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the
                 Mayishan was my name.

     And now Karen and Adele look at each other.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Can you open the door?

     Karen shakes her head "no."

                              ADELE
                 I'm not dressed.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen to me.
                      (lowers his voice)
                 I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

     Boom.  Karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of
     the table, sees Adele staring at her.

                              KAREN
                 Ask him his name.

                              ADELE
                 Who are you?

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                      (beat)
                 Jose Chirino.

     Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag.

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Or maybe you hear Jack Foley call me
                 Chino.  I'm the same person.

     Karen moves along the table to Adele...

                              KAREN
                      (soft)
                 Tell him to wait in the hall, you have
                 to get dressed.  Say it loud.

     As Adele speaks, Karen racks the slide on her 9mm.

                              ADELE
                 Wait in the hall!  I have to get
                 dressed!

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't
                 bother you no more.

     Karen motions for Adele to keep talking as she takes a position
     beside the door, where we now see Chino's silhouette in one of
     the three glass panels in the centre of the door.

                              ADELE
                 I don't know where he is.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape
                 from prison.  He tole me, I can't find
                 him to see you.  So why don't you open
                 this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can
                 speak.

                              ADELE
                      (staring at Karen)
                 Go away, or I'll call the police.

                              CHINO'S VOICE
                 Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

     Adele says nothing.  Then...

                              CHINO'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 Okay, you don't want to help me, I'm
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I'm going now.  I see you maybe some
                 time, okay?  Bye bye.

                              KAREN
                      (low)
                 Go in the bedroom and --

     Suddenly, Chino's fist -- wrapped in his shirt -- explodes
     through one of the glass panels.  Adele and Karen both jump as
     Chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob...

     ...but Karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight
     as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with Chino's arm
     still sticking through the glass...

     ...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he
     bangs against a wall and falls to the floor.  Dazed, Chino
     reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet.

     Karen brings up her Beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the
     front sight on his chest.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Leave it where it is.

                              CHINO
                      (frowning)
                 Wait.  You not Adele?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a federal marshal and you're under
                 arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I
                 mean, now.

                              CHINO
                 Oh.  Then this must be Adele...

     He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele.

                              KAREN
                 Put it down or I'll shoot.

                              CHINO
                 You wouldn't shoot me, would you?

                              KAREN
                 What do you want to bet?

                              CHINO
                      (beat)
                 I could walk out of here.

                              KAREN
                 If you move, if you look at her again,
                 you're dead.

     Chino doesn't move.  Keeps his gun on Adele.  Karen starts
     walking towards him...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You can live or die, it's up to you.

                              CHINO
                 Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot
                 me?  Nice girl like you?
                      (smiles)
                 I don't think so.

                              KAREN
                 You don't, huh?

     And with that, she kicks him in the knee.  Chino buckles over
     and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun...

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 On your knees.

     He does as he's told.  Karen raises his jacket, feels around
     his waist from behind.

                              ADELE (CONT'D)
                 Lie face down on the floor.

                              CHINO
                      (hurting)
                 What?!

     She kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there.  She puts
     her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials.  She
     sees Adele staring at her.

                              CHINO (CONT'D)
                      (to Adele)
                 Excuse me...

     Karen looks at Adele a moment, then says into the phone...

                              KAREN
                 Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.

                              CHINO
                 Excuse me, Adele?

                              ADELE
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 You do the sawing of the box in half
                 trick with you inside?

                              ADELE
                      (beat)
                 Yes.

                              CHINO
                 Tell me, how do you do that?

     Adele looks at Karen, who shoves Chino's head to the floor with
     her foot.

                              KAREN
                 Shut up.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying
                 to get a hold of you.

                              KAREN
                 Daniel.  Listen --

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Where are you?  I been trying to reach
                 you.

                              KAREN
                 I'm at Adele Delisi's.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 What-- we already talked to her.  That's
                 a dead end.

                              KAREN
                      (looking at Chino)
                 Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving.
                 Why were you trying to reach me?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around
                 the same time Foley was there.  We got
                 an address for him at the Adams Hotel
                 in Hallandale.  I want you to go there,
                 see if you can get the manager to i.d.
                 him as the other guy.  If he does, you
                 call me right away...

                              KAREN
                 All right, but...

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 But don't you do anything.  You just
                 have a seat, wait for me to get there.

                              KAREN
                 Sure, Daniel.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Now.  What is it you wanted to tell
                 me?

                              KAREN
                 Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to
                 bring in Chirino, would you put me on
                 the task force?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                      (impatient)
                 What?  Is that what you're calling me
                 about?

                              KAREN
                 Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will
                 you let me go after Foley?

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in
                 Chirino, you can be on the task
                 force.

                              KAREN
                 That's all I wanted to know.

                              BURDON (PHONE)
                 Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife
                 and get over to the Adams Hotel.

     Karen hangs up, looks at Adele.  Adele nods.

                              ADELE
                 You're good.

                              KAREN
                 Thank you.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As Foley and Buddy quickly pack up their stuff.

                              FOLEY
                 First thing we do, we get to Detroit,
                 we find Glenn, then we find a window
                 to throw him out of.

                              BUDDY
                 I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was
                 up there to take down the Ripper, where
                 would I go?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, first off, if you were Glenn,
                 you wouldn't be thinking.

                              BUDDY
                 Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal
                 from Lompoc?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be
                 brain dead by now.

                              BUDDY
                 He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told
                 me the Snoop's been managing some guys
                 up there now, works out at the Kronk.

     INT. SHALAMAR APARTMENTS - LOBBY - NIGHT

     The ancient residents stop what they're doing as Burdon enters
     with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out, running
     shoes, half of them carrying what look like athletic bags.
     Karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 You get the key?

                              KAREN
                 They're in 7D.

     She hands it to him as they wait for the elevator.

                              BURDON
                 I want two men outside, front and back.
                 Conway and Jessup go on up to seven,
                 cover both ends of the hall.

     Burdon, Karen and the remaining four SWAT team agents.  Burden
     looks at them one at a time.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 You're primary, you're secondary, you're
                 point man.

                              KAREN
                 You're gonna use a ram?

                              BURDON
                 Yeah, why?

                              KAREN
                 The manager's door is metal.

     They all look at her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You know what I mean?  They might all be.
                 And a ram on a metal door makes an awful
                 lot of noise for what good it does.

     Burdon looks at her, not all that happy she spoke up.  The fourth
     man raises the shotgun, a three-inch strip of metal taped to
     the muzzle.

                              FOURTH MAN
                 I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun
                 oughta do the trick.

                              BURDON
                 Fine.  Whatever.

     He sees the elevator still hasn't come down.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Fuck it.  Let's take the stairs.
                 Karen...

     Burdon pauses, looks at Karen, hands her a radio.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Take the radio, stay down here in the
                 lobby, watch the elevator.

                              KAREN
                 What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.

                              BURDON
                 You can go wait out in the car, you
                 want to.

     She doesn't say anything.

                              BURDON (CONT'D)
                 Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg
                 come in behind us, whatta you do?

                              KAREN
                      (pissed)
                 Call and tell you.

                              BURDON
                 And you let them come up.  You don't
                 try to make the bust yourself.  You
                 understand?

     Before she can answer, an old woman steps in, asks Burdon...

                              OLD WOMAN
                 Are you delivering the oxygen?

     Burdon looks at her, then nods for his men to start up the
     stairs.

     ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY

     Everyone's in position as Burdon eases the key into the lock,
     turns it.  The door won't budge, a dead bolt holds it shut.

     The guy with the shotgun puts the strip of metal against the
     seam, where the lock enters the frame, the muzzle of the shotgun
     exactly three inches now from the dead bolt, and looks over his
     shoulder at Burdon.

     With the sound of the blast, we then...

     CUT TO:  INSIDE THE ELEVATOR - DAY

     As Foley and Buddy ride down with an old lady.  The doors open.
     The woman doesn't move.

                              BUDDY
                 Is this your floor, mother?

                              OLD LADY
                 Oh.  Yes, it is.

     INT. THE LOBBY - SAME TIME - DAY

     As an old gent in a golf cap smiles at Karen sitting there on
     the couch in front of the elevator...

                              OLD GENT
                 Like to play some gin?

                              KAREN
                 No, thank you.

     He creeps off towards the elevator.

     INT. BUDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     As Burdon and his men fan out through the place...

     INT. LOBBY - DAY

     As we hear Burdon's voice.

                              BURDON (RADIO)
                 Karen.  They're not up here.  Keep
                 your eyes open.

     Karen looks off towards the street entrance, then back at the
     elevator where the man is still waiting, leaning on his cane.

     The elevator door opens to reveal Buddy and Foley.

                              OLD GENT
                 Going up?

     Buddy and Foley don't answer.  The old man starts to get on,
     feeling with his cane, taking forever.

     Karen and Foley are staring at each other.  He doesn't move.
     Not until the elevator door begins to close.

     Buddy sees Karen, helps the old man aboard as...

     Karen picks up her radio, is about to speak into it when...

     Foley raises his hand.  And waves as the door closes.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     As the elevator resumes going down.

                              OLD GENT
                 Shit, I wanted to go up.

                              BUDDY
                 Let's just hope there's no one in the
                 garage.

                              FOLEY
                 She looked right at me.  She didn't
                 yell or get excited.  She didn't move.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As they get in and Buddy starts the car...

                              BUDDY
                 They know where I live, I guess they
                 know what I drive, so maybe we should
                 pick up another car on the way.

                              FOLEY
                 She just sat there, looking right at
                 me.

     Buddy gives him a look, shakes his head and then burns rubber
     out of the garage as we...

     CUT TO: A CLOSE-UP OF KAREN - DAY

     Staring straight ahead.

                              BURDON (ON THE RADIO)
                 Karen.  Report.  You see anything?
                 Karen?  You there?  Karen...?

     INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

     As Marshall walks Karen to the gate.

                              MARSHALL
                 He waved to you?

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty
                 sure he did.

                              MARSHALL
                 You wave back?

                              KAREN
                 I didn't have time.

                              MARSHALL
                 I imagine you would've though.

     She shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got
                 two calls from Buddy up in Detroit
                 this morning, called Burdon.  She's
                 also the one gave Burdon Buddy's
                 address.

                              MARSHALL
                 So?

                              KAREN
                 So what I want to know is why Buddy
                 still calls his sister every week even
                 after she turned him in.

                              MARSHALL
                 He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
                      (then)
                 What I want to know is why, they got
                 such a big score up north, did Foley
                 hang around Miami for so long?
                      (looks at her)
                 Any thoughts on that one?

                              KAREN
                 None I'd like to share.

     She gives him a kiss...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'll call soon as I get in.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - DETROIT - DAY

     Snow.  Everywhere.  A black Lincoln Town Car creeps through the
     neighbourhood full of big, beautiful snow-covered homes.

                              MAURICE (VO)
                 I don't just manage fighters, or deal
                 product any more...

     INT. CAR - SAME

     Glenn -- sunglasses -- sits in the back with Maurice, aka "Snoopy" --
     wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses.

                              MAURICE
                 I've diversified since the last time
                 you saw me.  I've vertically integrated
                 and now I'm into home invasions and
                 the occasional grand larceny.

     Glenn just nods, stares out the window.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 White Boy Bob's my all-around man, my
                 bodyguard when I feel I need one, and
                 my driver.

     Maurice indicates WHITE BOY BOB, a fucking huge, depraved-
     looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Watch the road, boy.
                      (then)
                 I like this Town Car.  We can cruise
                 the man's neighbourhood without getting
                 the police or private security people
                 on our ass.

                              GLENN
                 Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving
                 around a black guy wearing shades and
                 a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they
                 won't think anything of it.

                              MAURICE
                 It's lilac, man, the color, and the
                 style's made known by Deion and other
                 defensive backs in the pros.  I could
                 be one of them living out here with
                 doctors of my race and basketball
                 players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's
                 house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick
                 wall.  There's his drive, right there.

     The car creeps past a huge Tudor-style country house.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming
                 up here, do this themself?

                              GLENN
                 If they're not busted now, they're
                 gonna be.
                      (then)
                 It's wide open.

     EXT./INT. CAR - MAURICE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DETROIT - LATER

     People on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black
     Town Car moves past the broken-down homes, cars on blocks and
     snow-covered trash.

                              GLENN
                 So you still haven't said, how you
                 wanna do it?

                              MAURICE
                 I'll show you, soon as I get one more
                 guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother,
                 Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.

                              GLENN
                 What?

     The car pulls to the kerb and KENNETH -- a wiry black man in a
     bright yellow T-shirt and red baseball cap backward, always
     seems to be high on some chemical or another - gets in.

                              MAURICE
                 You get everything?

     Kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat.  Glenn stares at
     it.  Something about the bag makes him uneasy.  Maybe it's the
     HACKSAW that sticks partially out of the opening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Cool.  Kenneth, this is the man I told
                 you about, Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 The one gonna help us rip off the rich
                 guy?

                              MAURICE
                 That's right.

                              GLENN
                 Help you...

     White Boy Bob pulls out again.  Glenn looks at the two psychos
     in front, then turns to Maurice.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 Wait a minute.  I'm letting you in on
                 this, not all your friends.

                              MAURICE
                 You just ask me how we gonna do it.
                 That's what I'm here for, tell you
                 how.  We the experts.

     Glenn can't believe this is happening.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Thing I'm worried about is you.

                              GLENN
                 Me?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah.  If you can step up and actually
                 do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just
                 talking the talk.

                              GLENN
                 Can I do what?

                              MAURICE
                 Walk in a house with me, do this cross-
                 dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I
                 used to sell to been dealin' on his
                 own.

                              GLENN
                 What-- when?

                              MAURICE
                 Right now, son.

                              GLENN
                 I don't have to prove shit to you.
                 The Ripley job is my job.  You're either
                 in or you're not.  You wanna pop some
                 crack dealer pissed you off, that's
                 your problem, not mine.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you
                 don't have to give me no tone of voice,
                 okay?  You don't like what I'm saying,
                 you can get out anywhere along here
                 you want.

                              GLENN
                 I think you're forgetting, this is my
                 car.  I drove it up here.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this
                 car, man, it's mine.  You go get
                 yourself another one.  I say I'm in on
                 Ripley?  I'm in, with or without your
                 ass.  I say I want you to come along
                 on another job, see if you for real or
                 not, guess what you gonna do?

     Glenn looks at Maurice, now ice-cold behind the shades.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We're here.

     Glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit-
     looking two-story house.  Maurice opens the gym bag, passes the
     hack saw and a HAND AXE up to White Boy Bob, a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN
     to Kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go see Eddie.

     Glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear...

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 Must take balls, do what you do.

     EXT. LOMPOC FPC - YARD - DAY

     As Foley walks with Ripley across the yard.

                              RIPLEY
                 Tell me something.  What's it like,
                 walk in a bank with a gun, stick it
                 up?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I never used a gun.

                              RIPLEY
                 Really?

                              FOLEY
                 You'd be surprised what all you can
                 get, you ask for it the right way.

                              RIPLEY
                      (smiles)
                 You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep
                 all my money in banks.

                              FOLEY
                 No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?
                      (Ripley smiles)
                 I'm talking about all those uncut
                 diamonds you told Glenn about.

                              RIPLEY
                      (still smiling)
                 I know what you're talking about.

                              FOLEY
                 You're the one with balls, Dick, say
                 something like that to someone like
                 Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where
                 you were for a minute.

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn?
                 I mean, do you believe Glenn?

                              FOLEY
                 Of course not.

                              RIPLEY
                 Plus, even it was true, he'd still
                 have to figure out where I keep 'em.

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You
                 told him you keep 'em at your house.

                              RIPLEY
                      (shrugs, big smile)
                 It's a big house.

     Ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables, looks around the
     yard.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Tell me something, Jack, how much longer
                 you in here?

                              FOLEY
                 Twenty-two months, three days, two
                 hours.  Why?

                              RIPLEY
                 I was just thinking that I could use a
                 guy like you, someone knows how to ask
                 for things the right way.  I'm talkin'
                 about when you're outta here.  I mean,
                 you can't rob banks for ever.

     Foley looks at Ripley.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a little late for me.

                              RIPLEY
                 Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make
                 my first million until I was forty-
                 two.  Forty-two.  You really want to
                 change, it's never too late.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I'm not exactly the
                 nine-to-five type.

                              RIPLEY
                 Who is?  But then you gotta look at a
                 job as more than just work.  You gotta
                 look at it as peace of mind.  As
                 security, you know what I mean?  I got
                 offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston,
                 take your pick.

                              FOLEY
                 My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down
                 there.

                              RIPLEY
                 No need to decide now.  Be like the
                 fish.  Let whatever happens happen.

                              FOLEY
                 The fish?

                              RIPLEY
                 Yeah, fish live in the present.  They
                 don't dwell on yesterday and they don't
                 worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big
                 fish attacks a little fish, there's no
                 neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward.
                 No whining on some fish-shrink's couch.
                 They just do it.  They accept.

                              FOLEY
                 I can't say that I've paid that much
                 attention to 'em before.

                              RIPLEY
                 The fish saved my life.  Two years
                 ago, I found out I had high blood
                 pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me
                 to go get an aquarium, look at the
                 fish every time I felt myself stressing
                 out.

                              FOLEY
                 And the guy sent you a bill for this?

                              RIPLEY
                 It works.  You should try it sometime.

                              FOLEY
                 The next time I walk into a bank.

     Ripley shakes his head, then gets up...

                              RIPLEY
                 Think about my offer, Jack.

     Foley watches him go.

                              BUDDY (V.O.)
                 Hey, Jack...

     CUT TO: CLOSE UP OF FOLEY

     As he turns to us.

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WE'RE INSIDE A CAR

     Across the street from the KRONK RECREATION CENTER -- a red-
     brick building in a bleak, depressing neighbourhood.

                              BUDDY
                 You see this one...

     Buddy reads from a newspaper while Foley watches the gym.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 "Fight over tuna casserole may have
                 spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's
                 live-in boyfriend, seventy years old,
                 complained about her tuna noodle
                 casserole and she shot him in the face
                 with a twelve-gauge.  Police found
                 noodles in the woman's hair and think
                 the guy dumped the casserole dish on
                 her before she shot him.  They'd been
                 together ten years.

                              FOLEY
                 Love is funny.

     Buddy looks at him.  Notices something over Foley's shoulder.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey--

     And now Foley turns and looks over as the black Town Car
     pulls into the Kronk parking lot.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME

     Kenneth and White Boy Bob nod along to some rap tape in the
     front seat.  Glenn sits in the back, looking pale, hugging
     himself, shaking.  Maurice looks out the window...

                              MAURICE
                 Was a time you see a gold Mercedes
                 over in the parking lot has a license
                 plate on it say HITMAN?  You know Tommy
                 Hearns is inside.  Seeing the car would
                 get our juices flowing.

     Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You already got your juices flowing,
                 huh?  Pissed your pants back there at
                 Eddie's house, didn't you?

     Glenn just looks at Maurice.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 That was some shit, huh?

                              GLENN
                      (indicates Kenneth)
                 Why'd he have to do that to that girl?

                              MAURICE
                 Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that
                 to that poor girl.

                              KENNETH
                      (smiles)
                 Do what?

     Glenn says nothing, just looks at Kenneth.

                              MAURICE
                 Just wait till we get inside Ripley's
                 house.

     And he and Whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car.

                              GLENN
                 It's all right with you, I'll just
                 hang in the car.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 No.  You gonna stay close to me from
                 now on.  So you don't disappear on me.

                              GLENN
                 Why would I do that?

     Maurice looks at him, starts laughing.  White Boy Bob and Kenneth
     join in.  Maurice leans over... Glenn flinches as Maurice opens
     Glenn's jacket so that we can see the BLOOD splattered on his T-
     shirt.

                              MAURICE
                 Was worse than you imagined, wasn't
                 it?
                      (then, smiles)
                 Baby, you with the bad boys now.

     INT. FOLEY AND BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     As they watch Glenn and Snoopy and White Boy Bob get out of the
     car.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you think?

                              FOLEY
                 I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
                 now we got us another partner.

                              BUDDY
                 Or two.

     INT. BOXING GYM - DAY

     Glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall, facing the ring.
     Kenneth grabs a magazine, walks into the john.  A shirtless
     White Boy Bob lifts weights while Maurice moves around the ring
     calling to the boxers inside.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab!

                              VOICE
                 Hey, Studs, how you doing?

     He looks up, sees Buddy and Foley coming this way.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus Christ, what're you guys doing
                 here?

     They sit down on either side of him, close.

                              FOLEY
                 Weren't you expecting us?

                              GLENN
                 That broad you picked up -- did you
                 know she was a US Marshal, for Christ
                 sake?

     Now he turns to Buddy as Buddy stands up, takes off his overcoat
     and sits down again.

                              GLENN (CONT'D)
                 She knew me from some bullshit dope
                 bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice.
                 You know what she said, we're in the
                 car on the turnpike?  "I never forget
                 anybody I've cuffed and shackled."

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  She said that to you?

     Glenn turns to see Foley with a mild expression on his face,
     almost smiling.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 What happened to your shades?  Someone
                 finally step on 'em?

                              GLENN
                      (touches his head)
                 I don't know...

     Foley notices the blood on Glenn's shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 Whose blood you got all over you?

                              GLENN
                 These guys, man, they're crazy.
                      (looks off)
                 Shit.

     Foley follows his gaze, sees Maurice coming this way, White Boy
     Bob beside him, carrying his shirts.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo
                 rag?

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now, tell fortunes?

     Maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron, looks from Foley
     to Buddy and back again, pretty serious about it.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 We have a problem here?

                              MAURICE
                      (walking over)
                 Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

                              FOLEY
                 Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.

                              MAURICE
                 It seems to me I been reading about
                 you in the newspaper.  Busted out of
                 some joint in Florida, huh?

                              FOLEY
                 Low class of people there, Snoop.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You call him that again I'll put your
                 head through the wall.

                              BUDDY
                 What?  You mean Snoop?

                              MAURICE
                 Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy,
                 is what White Boy's trying to say.
                 He's a little crude, you understand.
                 No, I left that Snoopy shit behind me.

                              BUDDY
                 But you call this bozo White Boy?

                              GLENN
                 White Boy Bob.
                      (baiting)
                 White Boy used to be a fighter.

                              BUDDY
                 What's he do now outside of shoot his
                 mouth off?

     White Boy Bob stares down Buddy who couldn't give a shit.

                              FOLEY
                 Like being back in the yard, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Just like it.  Nobody backing down.
                 You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what
                 you and Buddy doing up here in the
                 cold?

                              FOLEY
                 Glenn didn't tell you?

                              GLENN
                 I thought you guys were busted.

                              FOLEY
                 Why?  Just because you left us standing
                 on the side of the road?

     Foley looks at Glenn.  Glenn shrugs, laughs nervously.  Foley
     smiles, laughs with him, maybe a little too hard.  Now Maurice
     starts laughing.  Buddy, too.  White Boy's lost, looking from
     one guy to the next as Foley gets up, faces Maurice, his smile
     going away as he says...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn
                 promised you or what you think you're
                 gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy
                 get half of whatever we take from
                 Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn
                 cut up the rest is up to you.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go outside and talk.

                              FOLEY
                 What's the matter with right here?
                 It's nice and warm.

                              MAURICE
                 Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees
                 in here, sometimes a hundred -- the
                 way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd
                 sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy
                 Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any
                 business in here.  To me this is holy
                 ground, man.  You understand?  I got
                 to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to
                 talk, come to the fights tomorrow night,
                 we'll sit down and look at it good.
                 The State Theater.

     Foley nods then looks at Glenn as Buddy gets up.

                              FOLEY
                 We'll see you tomorrow then.

     Maurice then watches as they walk out.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, how much is the reward on
                 the man again?

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Ten gees.

                              MAURICE
                 Uh-huh.
                      (then)
                 You recall, did it say dead or alive?

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     The same decrepit two-storey place Maurice et al hit earlier.
     Now it's a CRIME SCENE.  A SMALL CROWD of neighbourhood gawkers
     stand just behind the yellow tape.  A HUGE SPOTLIGHT lights up
     the front yard.

     Karen pulls up in her rental car, gets out and badges the visibly-
     freezing COP at the tape, working crowd control.

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Ray Cruz.

                              COP
                 He's inside.
                      (pissed)
                 With everybody else.

     Karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk.  She pauses
     to watch as two CORONER'S ASSISTANTS cover with a sheet a DEAD
     BLACK WOMAN who lies just below a broken upstairs window.

     INT. HOUSE - SAME

     Hell.  Karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in
     the doorway.  Straight ahead on the stairs is another body, A
     MAN ON HIS BACK, head down the stairs, shotgun blast to the
     chest.  He wears a dress, now bunched up around his waist.

     Congealed blood runs down the stairs.  COPS and CRIME SCENE
     TECHS are everywhere.  Karen looks at the guy on the stairs.

                              VOICE
                 Called themselves the Youngboys.

     Karen looks over as RAYMOND CRUZ, a stocky, genial-looking
     detective comes out of the kitchen.

                              CRUZ
                 Ironic, isn't it?

                              KAREN
                 How are you, Raymond?

                              CRUZ
                 Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.

     He kisses her on the cheek.  She indicates the body by the door.

                              KAREN
                 Quite a mess.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked
                 Eddie.

                              KAREN
                 Who?

                              CRUZ
                 Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon,
                 used to buy scag off a corner till he
                 kicked it and found his happiness with
                 crack and then started dealing himself.
                 Word on the street was he was saving
                 up for an operation.

                              KAREN
                 What is it with crack and transsexuals?

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had
                 these girls cooked the rocks he called
                 the Rockettes.

                              KAREN
                 Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.

                              CRUZ
                 Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped
                 her, shot her, then threw her out the
                 window.
                      (shakes his head)
                 Fuckin' animals.

     This shuts them both up.  Cruz indicates the door.

                              CRUZ (CONT'D)
                 Let's get some air.

     She starts to follow him out, pauses as she sees something on
     the ground...

     A BROKEN PAIR OF SUNGLASSES

     Wrap-around... a lot like the ones she remembers Glenn wearing.
     Karen stares at them a moment, then walks out.

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     As Cruz and Karen walk to his car, STROBES FLASH as press
     photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene.

                              CRUZ
                 Other than we had so much fun the last
                 time we worked together.  You gonna
                 tell me why you're comin' to me instead
                 of the FBI?

                              KAREN
                 I report to the FBI, first thing they're
                 gonna do is ask me to go get some
                 coffee.

                              CRUZ
                 You know, I'm not in homicide any more.

                              KAREN
                 No, I didn't know that.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and
                 property now, also sex crimes and child
                 abuse.

                              KAREN
                 Detroit, you must be pretty busy.

                              CRUZ
                 Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions
                 are big, too.

                              KAREN
                 Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had
                 this guy Glenn Michaels on possession
                 with intent but couldn't make it stick.
                 In his statement, Glenn said he went
                 up to Detroit to visit a friend and
                 look into job opportunities -- if you
                 can believe that.

                              CRUZ
                 Who was the friend?

                              KAREN
                 Guy named Maurice Miller, also known
                 as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.

                              CRUZ
                 Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a
                 fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray
                 Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other
                 Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.

                              KAREN
                 I'll need a last known address.

                              CRUZ
                 That's fine, but I don't want you to
                 talk to Miller alone.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer,
                 I'm armed.

     He turns and looks at her.

                              CRUZ
                 Yes, you are.  I'll call you tomorrow
                 with the address.

     As he gets into his car, we then:

     CUT TO: A NEWSPAPER

     The crime scene from the night before.  A shot of Karen and Ray
     Cruz as they exit the house.  A headline reads "TRIPLE MURDER"
     blah-blah-blah...

                              BUDDY (PHONE)
                 You have the paper?

     REVEAL: FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley, wearing a suit now, no shoes, no tie, looks at the
     newspaper photograph of Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 It's a terrific shot of her.

     INT. BUDDY'S ROOM - SAME

     Buddy looking at the same shot...

                              BUDDY
                 Outside of that.

     INTERCUTTING FOLEY & BUDDY

                              FOLEY
                 Doesn't say what she's doing up here,
                 but I don't think it has anything to
                 do with us.

                              BUDDY
                 She came up here on her vacation, 'cause
                 she likes shitty weather.

     Foley reaches in one of the bags from the Jewish Recycling Center
     and pulls out a tie.

                              FOLEY
                 I think she's after Glenn.  The girl
                 still with you?

                              BUDDY
                 They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less
                 you pay for it.

                              FOLEY
                 You tell your sister about it?

                              BUDDY
                 Just hung up.

                              FOLEY
                 How long you talk to her?

                              BUDDY
                 Two hours.

                              FOLEY
                 How long were you with the girl?

                              BUDDY
                 Forty-five minutes.

                              FOLEY
                 You didn't tell your sister about
                 Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna
                 go through that again.

                              BUDDY
                 Forget about my sister.  If Karen
                 Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked.
                 Tomorrow night at the fights we all
                 get picked up.

                              FOLEY
                 Let's drive by where we're meeting and
                 have a look.  Maybe take a look at
                 Ripley's place while we're at it.

     Foley hangs up.  He faces the mirror, starts to tie his tie.

                              RIPLEY (V.O.)
                 I guess next time I see you, you'll be
                 wearing a suit and tie...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - DAY

     Foley leans in the doorway watching as Ripley, dressed in a
     jogging suit, and under the watchful eye of A GUARD, gathers up
     his belongings.  He's going home.

                              FOLEY
                 I still haven't made up my mind yet.

                              RIPLEY
                 What's to think about?

                              FOLEY
                 You goin' right back to work?

                              RIPLEY
                 First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year,
                 study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz...
                 then come back, maybe take some tennis
                 lessons.

     He tears a picture off the wall...

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Here...
                      (hands it to Foley)
                 Something to remember me by.

     Foley stares at the photograph of sea life.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 It's not the real thing, but it's still
                 nice to look at.

     Foley looks at Ripley, who extends his hand.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 See you on the outside, Jack.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Foley finishes tying his tie, stares into the mirror, takes in
     the overall effect.

                              FOLEY
                      (smiles)
                 Hi!  I just broke outta jail!

     His smile fades, he then sits down heavily on the bed, looks at
     the picture of Karen another moment, then sets the paper aside,
     grabs the Yellow Pages, flips to HOTELS, and dials the phone...

                              VOICE (PHONE)
                 Atheneum Hotel.

                              FOLEY
                 Karen Sisco, please.

                              VOICE
                      (pause, then)
                 I'm sorry, but there's no one by that
                 name registered.

                              FOLEY
                 Thank you.

     He dials the next number...

                              VOICE
                 Best Western...

     EXT. MAURICE "SNOOPY" MILLER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Red brick, showing its age.  Karen rings the doorbell and then
     waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark, navy
     coat.  The door opens to reveal Moselle in her green silk robe
     holding her arms close against the cold.

                              KAREN
                 Moselle Miller?

                              MOSELLE
                 What do you want?

                              KAREN
                 I'm looking for Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 You find him, tell him the dog got run
                 over and I'm out of grocery money.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Moselle.  Who you talking to?

                              MOSELLE
                 Lady looking for Maurice.

                              MALE VOICE
                 What's she want?

                              MOSELLE
                 Hasn't said.

                              KAREN
                 That's not Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's
                 talking on the phone.

                              MALE VOICE
                 Ask what she want with him?

                              MOSELLE
                 You ask her.  Maurice's business is
                 none of my business.

     Sounding tired or bored.  She turns from the door and walks
     into the living room.  Karen steps inside, pushes the door
     closed and steps into the foyer.

                              MALE VOICE
                 How do I know?

     Karen peers into a study, a small room with empty bookcases and
     sees Kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on
     the phone...

                              KENNETH
                 The State, huh.  Who's fighting?

     Karen walks into the living room, where Moselle sits on the sofa
     lighting a cigarette.

                              MOSELLE
                 You like to sit down?

                              KAREN
                 Thanks.

     Karen takes a chair and looks around the room: dismal, gray
     daylight in the windows, dark wood and white stucco, the
     fireplace full of trash, plastic cups, wrappers, a pizza box.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm looking for a friend of mine I think
                 Maurice knows.

                              MOSELLE
                 You not with probation, one of those?

                              KAREN
                 No.

                              MOSELLE
                 You a lawyer?

                              KAREN
                      (smiles)
                 No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him.
                 Glenn Michaels?

     Moselle draws on her cigarette, blows out a stream of smoke.

                              MOSELLE
                 Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed here last November.

                              MOSELLE
                 Here?  In this house?

                              KAREN
                 He said he stayed with Maurice.

                              MOSELLE
                 Well, he ain't even here that much.  I
                 like to know where he goes, but at the
                 same time I don't want to know, you
                 understand?

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Your dog was killed?

                              MOSELLE
                 Got run over by a car.

                              KAREN
                 What did you call it?

     Moselle looks at the couch, where a MANGLED FRISBEE sits.

                              MOSELLE
                 Was a she, name Tuffy.

                              KAREN
                      (nods, then)
                 Where do you think I might find Maurice?

                              MOSELLE
                 I don't know -- the gym, the fights.
                 I know he don't miss the fights.  Having
                 some tomorrow night at the State
                 Theater.  He use to take me.

                              KAREN
                 The State Theater?

                              VOICE
                 What you want with Maurice?

     Karen turns, sees Kenneth standing in the arched entrance from
     the foyer.

                              MOSELLE
                 She looking for a man name of Glenn.

                              KENNETH
                 Did I ask you?  Go on out of here.  Do
                 something with yourself.

     He waits until Moselle gets up, not saying a word, walks away
     from them through the dining room.  Karen watches him come toward
     her now in kind of an easy strut.  She indicates the scar over
     his eye...

                              KAREN
                 You're a fighter?

                              KENNETH
                 How you know that?

                              KAREN
                 I can tell.

                              KENNETH
                 I was...

     He moves his head in what might be a feint.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 Till I got my retina detached two time.

     He's standing so close to her, Karen has to look up at him.

                              KAREN
                 What'd you fight, middleweight?

                              KENNETH
                 Light to super-middleweight, as my
                 body developed.  You go about what,
                 bantam?

                              KAREN
                 Flyweight.

                              KENNETH
                 You know your divisions.  You like the
                 fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah,
                 I bet you do.
                      (moves closer)
                 Like to get down and tussle a little
                 bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she
                 got run over, we use to get down on
                 the floor and tussle.  I say to her,
                 "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat
                 for you."  And I give Tuffy what every
                 dog love best.  You know what that is?
                 A bone.
                      (real close)
                 I can give you a bone, too, girl.

                              KAREN
                 You're not my type.

                              KENNETH
                 Don't matter.  I let the monster out,
                 you gonna do what it wants.

                              KAREN
                 Just a minute.

     Her hand goes into her bag next to the chair.

                              KENNETH
                 Bring your own rubbers with you?

     Her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip
     on a golf club.  Kenneth grins at her...

                              KENNETHN (CONT'D)
                 What else you have in there, mace?
                 Have a whistle, different kinds of
                 female-protection shit?

     Karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face-to-face.

                              KAREN
                 I have to go, Kenneth.

     She gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton that's
     like a golf club grip.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Maybe we'll see each other again, okay?

     She steps aside and brushes past him.  He grabs her left wrist...

                              KENNETH
                 We gonna tussle first.

     Karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots
     out of the grip.  She pulls an arm's length away from him and
     chops the rigid shaft at his head, Kenneth hunching, ducking
     away...

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 God damn...

     He lets go of her and Karen gets the room she needs, so that
     when he comes at her, she whips the shaft across the side of
     his head and he howls, stops dead, presses a hand over his ear.

                              KENNETH (CONT'D)
                 What's wrong with you?

                              KAREN
                 You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

     And she walks out.  She sees Moselle standing there in the foyer.
     Karen looks at her a moment, puts the baton in her purse and
     comes out with a business card.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wrote my hotel number on there -- in
                 case you run into Glenn.

     Moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe.  Karen smiles
     at her and walks out the door.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - DAY

     It's snowing pretty hard when Foley and Buddy pull up out front.

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - SAME

     Buddy wipes the condensation off his window, so they can see
     the house.

                              BUDDY
                 Now that's a really big house.

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost
                 looks like a prison.

                              BUDDY
                 No doubt the man's got some big-ass
                 security system.

                              FOLEY
                 Time comes, we knock on the door.  See
                 if he wants to talk about old times.
                 Go in the easy way.

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we
                 got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole
                 with us?

                              FOLEY
                 Who says anybody's gonna be with us?
                 I say we go to the fights tomorrow,
                 find out what the Snoop's big plan is,
                 then go in ahead of those guys --
                 alone.

                              BUDDY
                 Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while
                 we're off livin' the good life.

                              FOLEY
                 Tell me something, Buddy.  You know
                 anyone who's actually done one last
                 big score and gone to live the good
                 life?  Cause it occurred to me that
                 everyone talks about doing it, but I
                 don't know anyone who's actually gone
                 and done it.  Do you?

                              BUDDY
                      (beat)
                 What about that D.B. Cooper guy?

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 I mean, they don't know for sure he's
                 dead.
                      (then)
                 Look, there's always a chance we'll
                 walk out've there with nothing.  I say
                 let fate decide.

                              FOLEY
                 Let fate decide?  What're you, the
                 fuckin' Dali Lama now?

                              BUDDY
                 My sister believes in fate, but not
                 hell.  That's why she stopped praying
                 for the lost souls since you don't
                 hear that much about purgatory anymore.
                 But every day she asks her boss to
                 pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think,
                 you think there's a hell, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional
                 Institution and I'm sure as shit not
                 going back there or any place like it.

                              BUDDY
                 You might not have a choice.

     Foley looks at him.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 They put a gun on you, you'll go back.

                              FOLEY
                 They put a gun on you, you still have
                 a choice, don't you?

     Foley turns back to the house.  And now we hear...

                              MR. HEARN (VO)
                 I think you're gonna fit right in...

     INT. RIPLEY ENTERPRISES PERSONNEL OFFICE - DAY

     The personnel guy, MR. HEARN, sits behind his desk, squeezing a
     grip exerciser and smiling warmly at Foley, who wears a shitty
     suit and tie.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long
                 discussion about your role in the
                 company and it was his feeling that
                 you would be happiest working down
                 here in Miami.  How's that sound to
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 Great.

     Mr. Hearn pauses, looks down at Foley...

                              MR. HEARN
                 You're about a 42 long, right?

                              FOLEY
                 What?

     But Mr. Hearn walks out without answering.  Foley looks at the
     desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half-eaten fruit-on-the-
     bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half-eaten Powerbar.

     Foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with
     it.

                              MR. HEARN
                 Okay.  Let's see how she fits.

     Foley turns as Mr. Hearn bounces back into the room with what
     looks like a UNIFORM draped over one arm.

                              FOLEY
                 What is this?

                              MR. HEARN
                 Your uniform.

                              FOLEY
                 My what?

     Mr. Hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads SECURITY on one
     arm.  Foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Are you kidding me?

     RICHARD RIPLEY'S OFFICE

     View.  Wet bar.  Huge fucking aquarium.

                              RECEPTIONIST (OS)
                 Sir, you can't go in there...

     Ripley looks up from his desk as Foley steps in, the receptionist
     right behind him now.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack?  Whoa-- what's the problem?
                 Take it easy, let's talk...

     Meanwhile, Ripley pushes a PANIC BUTTON beneath his desk...

                              FOLEY
                 A security guard?  Are you fucking
                 kidding me?

     Ripley considers Foley a moment, then...

                              RIPLEY
                 You know, I wasn't sure you'd show up.
                 But I was pretty sure that, if you
                 did, you'd throw the job in my face.
                      (then)
                 Understand something, Jack.  Up to
                 this point, everything you've done
                 with your life means absolutely nothing
                 in the real world.  Less than nothing.

     Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 You're a bank robber.  This is not a
                 marketable skill.  There are no old
                 bank robbers out in the world living
                 on pensions.  You know this.  That's
                 why you're here right now.
                 
     Still Foley says nothing.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at
                 a lousy wage.  You think you're better
                 than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me
                 that you're really willing to change
                 and we'll talk about something better.
                 A lot better.  But first, Jack, you
                 gotta earn it.

                              FOLEY
                 How, Dick?  The way you earned it?  By
                 marrying some rich broad owns the
                 company, selling it off a piece at a
                 time, then divorcing her?  What is
                 this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by
                 the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in
                 prison, guy like you, place like that,
                 you were ice cream for freaks.  You
                 were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and
                 a dozen other guys coulda bled you
                 till you had nothing.  Till you were
                 nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll
                 pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a
                 fuckin stool all day saying "sign in
                 here please" or "hey, pal, you can't
                 park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do
                 it.

                              RIPLEY
                 Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I
                 misjudged you.

     Two massive SECURITY GUARDS appear in the doorway...

                              FOLEY
                 Hey, what job he promise you guys?

                              GUARD
                 There's two ways we can do this.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah?  What are they?

                              RIPLEY
                 Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down
                 now.  Haven't we, Jack?

                              FOLEY
                 Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally
                 "relaxed..."

     And with that he picks up a paperweight (A LEAD FISH) and wings
     it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S BUILDING - FLORIDA - DAY

     As Foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two
     guards.  He picks himself up.  He kicks at the guards, who wave
     him off, go back inside.

     Foley then starts down the steps, pauses as he sees...

     THE BANK ACROSS THE STREET

     The one from the opening.  Foley looks at it a moment, then
     calmly starts to take off his tie, drops it in the gutter as he
     starts across the street...

                                                             CUT TO:

     INT. BUDDY'S CAR - DAY

     As Buddy pulls away from the house, Foley pulls out the clipping of
     Karen he tore out of the morning paper.  He's written the name 
     "WESTIN" on it.

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, I gotta get some better shoes,
                 few other things before tomorrow.  Why
                 don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen,
                 we'll hook up later?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, and I better call my sister.

     CUT TO: THE SNOWSTORM

     It's really coming down.  We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL we're
     looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of
     the Westin.

     A table of three young EXECUTIVE-LOOKING GUYS in suits are
     laughing at something until Karen is ushered by a WAITRESS to
     an adjacent table.

                              KAREN
                 Jack Daniel's, please, water on the
                 side.

     She turns, sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast
     sky, snow swirling, blowing in gusts, seven hundred feet above
     the city, down there somewhere.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY'S VOICE
                 Celeste, do us again, please, and put
                 the lady's drink on our bill.

     She turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her, smiling,
     pleasant-looking guys in dark suits.

                              KAREN
                 Thanks anyway.

                              WAITRESS
                      (drifting over)
                 They want to buy you a drink.

                              KAREN
                 I get that.  Tell them I'd rather pay
                 for my own.

     She then watches the three guys looking at the waitress
     delivering the message.  Then they look at Karen.  She gives
     them a shrug, turns to watch the snow.  Her drink arrives.  She
     takes a sip, looks up as one of the guys comes over...

                              EXECUTIVE GUY
                 Excuse me.  My associates and I made a
                 bet on what you do for a living.

     She glances at the table, the other two watching.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY (CONT'D)
                 And I won.  Hi, I'm Philip.

                              KAREN
                 If it's okay with you, Philip, I'd
                 like to just have a quiet drink and
                 leave.  Okay?

                              PHILIP
                 Don't you want to know what I guessed?
                 How I know what you do for a living?

                              KAREN
                 Tell you the truth, I'm not even mildly
                 curious.  Really, I don't want to be
                 rude, Philip, I'd just like to be left
                 alone.

     She turns back to the snowstorm.  She sees his reflection turn
     and leave.  A moment later, the next one appears at the table.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2
                 I think I know why you're depressed --
                 if I may offer an observation.

     She just looks at him.  So sure of himself.

                              EXECUTIVE GUY #2 (CONT'D)
                 I have a hunch you're the new sales
                 rep and your customer isn't exactly
                 knocked out by the idea of a young
                 lady, even one as stunning as you,
                 handling the account.  Am I close?
                 Hi, I'm Andy.

     She says nothing to him.

                              ANDY
                 We're ad guys.  We flew in from New
                 York this morning to pitch Hiram Walker
                 Distillery, present this test-market
                 campaign for their new margarita mix.
                 What we do, we show this guy who looks
                 like a Mexican bandido, you know, with
                 the big Chihuahua hat, the bullet belts--

                              KAREN
                 Andy?  Really.  Who gives a shit?

     He gives her a sympathetic expression.

                              ANDY
                 Want to tell me what happened?

                              KAREN
                 Beat it, will you?

     She stares at the guy until he turns away.  She sips her drink,
     stares once more out at the blizzard.  After a few moments,
     another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.

                              VOICE
                 Can I buy you a drink?

     Boom.  Not one of the executive guys.  She stares at the
     reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at JACK
     FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 Yeah, I'd love one.
                      (then)
                 Would you like to sit down?

     He pulls the chair out, looking at her.  The three guys at the
     other table now staring as he sits down.  Foley offers his
     hand...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm Gary.

     She hesitates, then shakes his hand...

                              KAREN
                 I'm Celeste.

     She smiles with him.  When she lowers her hand to the table,
     his hand comes down to cover hers.  She watches his expression
     as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers,
     and lays her hand on his.  The tips of her fingers brush his
     knuckles, lightly back and forth.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 It takes hours to get a drink around
                 here.  There's only one waitress.

                              FOLEY
                 I can go to the bar.

                              KAREN
                 Don't leave me.

                              FOLEY
                 Those guys bother you?

                              KAREN
                 No, they're all right.  I meant, you
                 just got here.

     She picks up her drink and places it in front of him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Help yourself.

     She watches him take a sip, smack his lips.

                              FOLEY
                 You like bourbon?

                              KAREN
                 Love it.

                              FOLEY
                      (passes the glass
                       back)
                 Well, we got that out of the way.
                      (then)
                 Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for
                 a living?

                              KAREN
                 I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call
                 on a customer and they gave me a hard
                 time because I'm a girl.

                              FOLEY
                 Is that how you think of yourself?

                              KAREN
                 What, as a sales rep?

                              FOLEY
                 A girl.

                              KAREN
                 I don't have a problem with it.

                              FOLEY
                 I like your hair.  And that suit.

                              KAREN
                 I had one just like it -- well, it was
                 the same idea, but I had to get rid of
                 it.

                              FOLEY
                 You did?

                              KAREN
                 It smelled.

                              FOLEY
                 Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?

                              KAREN
                 No.
                      (then)
                 What do you do for a living, Gary?

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 How far do we go with this?

     This stops her, throws her off balance.

                              KAREN
                 Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think it works if we're somebody
                 else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and
                 Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about
                 anything?

                              KAREN
                 It's your game.  I've never played
                 this before.

                              FOLEY
                 It's not a game.  Something you play.

                              KAREN
                 Well, does it make sense to you?

                              FOLEY
                 It doesn't have to, it's something
                 that happens.  It's like seeing a person
                 you never saw before -- you could be
                 passing on the street -- you look at
                 each other and for a few seconds,
                 there's a kind of recognition.  Like
                 you both know something.  But then the
                 next moment the person's gone, and
                 it's too late to do anything about it,
                 but you remember it because it was
                 right there and you let it go, and you
                 think, "What if I had stopped and said
                 something?"  It might happen only a
                 few times in your life.

                              KAREN
                 Or once.

     They look at each other a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 Why don't we get out of here.

     They both get up.  The ad guys at the table watch as she follows
     Foley to the elevator.  Karen winks at them.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     As they ride down to Karen's room.  She looks at him, looks
     away.  The doors open and they exit.

     INT. HER HOTEL SUITE

     As he follows her in.  She walks to the bar, fixes them each a
     drink.  He checks out the room, takes in her view.

                              KAREN
                 How'd you find me?

     He comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her
     picture and shows it to her.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Oh, God...

                              FOLEY
                 I called your room from downstairs.

                              KAREN
                 If I had answered, what were you gonna
                 say?

                              FOLEY
                 Well, I'd say who I was and do you
                 remember me and ask if you'd like to
                 meet for a drink.

                              KAREN
                 If I remembered you.  I came looking
                 for you.  I would've said sure, let's
                 do it.  But for all you knew I could
                 show up with a SWAT team.  Why would
                 you trust me?

                              FOLEY
                 It would be worth the risk.

     She looks at him, touches his face with her hand...

                              KAREN
                 You like taking risks.

                              FOLEY
                 So do you.

     He kisses her now, puts his arms around her.

                              KAREN
                 What's the hurry, Jack?  You have to
                 be somewhere?

     She hands him his drink.  They both drink, then...

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 Sooner or later...

     She stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 You really wear that suit.

                              FOLEY
                 That's not what you were about to say.

     She shrugs, lets it go.  He puts down his drink, kisses her.
     She lets him, then moves to the couch.

                              KAREN
                 Remember how talkative you were?  In
                 the trunk?  Adele said you do that
                 when you're nervous.

                              FOLEY
                 She did, huh.

                              KAREN
                 You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, but in a nice way.

     He sits down and they kiss again.  This time she peels his jacket
     off.  He does the same with hers.  He's starting to unbutton
     her blouse when--

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                      (unbuttoning)
                 I might've smelled like a sewer, but
                 you could tell I was a gentleman.
                 They say John Dillinger was a pretty
                 nice guy.

                              KAREN
                 He killed a police officer.

     He stops.  Looks at her.

                              FOLEY
                 I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop
                 fell as Dillinger was aiming at his
                 leg and got him through the heart.

                              KAREN
                 You believe that?

                              FOLEY
                 Why not?

     She looks at him, decides to get off this subject.  Anyway he's
     finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands
     inside her shirt.  She closes her eyes.

                              KAREN
                 You know that Sig .380 you took was my
                 favourite.  My father gave it to me.

     As he kisses her on the neck.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 What were you gonna do with me?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.  I hadn't worked that
                 part out yet.  All I knew was that I
                 liked you, and I didn't want to leave
                 you there, never see you again.

                              KAREN
                 You waved to me in the elevator.

     She's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't sure you caught that.

                              KAREN
                 I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking
                 of you by then, a lot, wondering what
                 it would be like if we did meet.  Like
                 if we could take a time-out...

                              FOLEY
                 Really?  I was thinking the same thing.
                 If we could call time and get together
                 for a while.

     They look at each other a moment.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You know I saw you on the street.

                              KAREN
                 Where?

                              FOLEY
                 Outside Adele's.

     He starts to kiss her again, but--

                              KAREN
                 You were going to see her?

                              FOLEY
                 To warn her about Chino.

                              KAREN
                 So she did help you?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't think we should get into that.

                              KAREN
                 No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't
                 ask if he's with you or what you're
                 doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've
                 run into Glenn Michaels yet.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare
                 me.

     And he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.

                              KAREN
                 Come on.

     He gets up and she leads him across the room...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to
     take off his pants.

                              KAREN
                 Are you gonna leave your tie on?

     He looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she
     gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him,
     standing close to help him with the tie...

                              FOLEY
                 My God, look at you.

     When her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck
     again and then as she turns off the light...

     She kisses him.  He sits down on the bed, drawing her back with
     him, the only light now coming from the sitting room.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You having fun?

     She smiles and then they start to make love as we then...

     FADE OUT.

     CUT TO: KAREN

     Eyes open, serious now.

     REVEAL

     She's lying in Jack's arms.  She looks at him a moment, then
     moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed.

                              FOLEY
                 You coming back?

                              KAREN
                 I'm just going to the bathroom.

     She gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the
     door.  Foley picks up his Zippo off the night table.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     She comes in.  Looks at herself in the mirror.  Suddenly
     feels self-conscious.  She grabs a bathrobe off the door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     Foley lies there, fiddling with the Zippo, staring up at the
     ceiling.  She comes out again and stands looking down at him.

                              KAREN
                 I want you to know something.  I wasn't
                 looking for just a fuck, if that's
                 what you're thinking.

                              FOLEY
                 Why are you mad?

                              KAREN
                 Or I did it for some kind of kinky
                 thrill.  Score with a bank robber the
                 way some women go for rough trade.

                              FOLEY
                 What about my motive?  Now I can say I
                 fucked a US Marshal.  You think I
                 will?

                              KAREN
                 I don't know.

     He raises the covers, but she just stands there.

                              FOLEY
                 I know of a guy he goes in the bank
                 holding a bottle he says is
                 nitroglycerin.  He scores some cash
                 off a teller, he's on his way out when
                 he drops the bottle.  It shatters on
                 the tile floor, he slips in the stuff,
                 cracks his head and they've got him.
                 The nitro was canola oil.  I know more
                 fucked-up bank robbers than ones that
                 know what they're doing.  I doubt one
                 in ten can tell a dye pack when he
                 sees one.  Most bank robbers are fucking
                 morons.  To go to bed with a bank robber
                 for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd
                 have to be as dumb as they are.  I
                 know you're not dumb, so why would I
                 think that?  Why would you think I
                 might think that?

     She comes over and sits down on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 You're not dumb.

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know about that.  You can't do
                 three falls and think you have much of
                 a brain.

     They lie there for a few moments, Karen watching him.  He senses
     this, looks at her...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 You getting serious on me now?

                              KAREN
                 I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know
                 what's gonna happen.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 You know.

     And he kisses her.

     EXT. DETROIT - DAY

     The sun is out.  The snow has stopped falling.  A white blanket
     covers everything.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

     Karen opens her eyes, wakes up.  She closes them again, lies
     on her side, but doesn't move for a moment.  Then...

                              KAREN
                 Oh, for Christ sake, grow up.

     She opens her eyes and rolls on to her back.  She turns her head:
     Foley's gone.  She gets out of bed.

     INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Karen comes into the room tying her robe.  She looks at the
     coffee table where...

     Something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half-empty bottle and
     the ice bucket.  She picks it up and slowly unfolds the "gift"
     from Foley:  Her Sig-Sauer .38.

     INT. FOLEY'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Buddy stands at the window looking out as Foley -- in his
     underwear -- sits at the table reading the newspaper, a room-
     service breakfast, a bottle of Jim Beam close by.

                              BUDDY
                 It took you, what, seven hours to buy
                 a pair of shoes?

                              FOLEY
                 I saw Karen Sisco.

     Buddy turns to him.

                              BUDDY
                 And she saw you?

                              FOLEY
                 Yes, she did.

                              BUDDY
                 So how's that work, a wanted felon
                 socializing with a U.S. Marshal?

                              FOLEY
                 You know how I felt about her.

                              BUDDY
                 Did you give her a jump?  If you did I
                 might begin to understand where your
                 head's at.

                              FOLEY
                 It wasn't about getting laid.  I just
                 wanted to know what might've happened
                 if things were different.

                              BUDDY
                 You find out?

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, I did.

     Buddy watches Foley pour a shot of Jim Beam in his coffee.

                              BUDDY
                 So what's that mean?  That you're
                 disappointed by what you found or you're
                 sorry you robbed all those banks?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Karen sits there staring at a Wild Turkey bottle, a couple of
     glasses.  She reaches for the phone, dials.  A moment later, we
     hear MARSHALL SISCO'S ANSWERING MACHINE and she hangs up.

     INT. STATE THEATER - NIGHT

     A ring set up on stage.  Men hang out on the side.  Where movie
     seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables; a row of
     them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through
     the theatre to the bar.  Rap music booms out of speakers as
     fighters are announced.

     Everyone in here is black except for Glenn and White Boy Bob
     who sit at a table in the front row while Maurice in a dude
     black felt cap set on his head just right and shades walks along
     the apron of the stage.

                              MAURICE
                 Stick and jab, stick and jab!

     White Boy Bob throws down a beer and gives Glenn's shoulder a jab.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 You drink like a girl.

     White Boy looks around to see if there are any other morons
     sitting nearby who think it's funny.  Kenneth comes through for
     his pal and laughs.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     As Karen walks through the bar, pauses as she sees Glenn sitting
     with White Boy and Kenneth.  She steps back into the shadows as
     Glenn glances anxiously about.

     ON GLENN

     As he pushes his chair back.

                              GLENN
                 I got to go take a piss.

     He hesitates, sees the car keys on the table in front of White
     Boy Bob.  But before he can grab them...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 What're you telling us for?  You want
                 somebody to hold your little pecker?

     Glenn gets up, sees his coat on the back of the chair, but knows
     he can't take it with him.  He walks away from the table.

     EXT. STATE THEATER - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

     Glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot.
     Karen exits right after, watches him get into the Town Car.

     INT. TOWN CAR - SAME TIME

     Glenn behind the wheel, half lying on his right side as he tries
     to rip open the locked glove compartment.  His head jerks around
     as Karen opens the door.  He sits up straight as she gets in
     with him.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, are you trying to steal this
                 car?

                              GLENN
                 Jesus, I don't believe it.

                              KAREN
                 Another one of those days, huh, nothing
                 seems to go right?

     He raises his empty hands.

                              GLEN
                 I don't have the keys.

                              KAREN
                 I see that.

                              GLENN
                 I mean I'm not stealing the fucking
                 car.

                              KAREN
                 You're not?

                              GLENN
                 I already stole it.  Last week or
                 whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't
                 be stealing it again, can I?

                              KAREN
                 The two guys you were with -- that
                 one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it?
                 I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that
                 didn't look like him.

                              GLENN
                 Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?

     Karen looks at him, shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 Glenn, I know your life history, who
                 your friends are, where you've been
                 and now, it looks like, where you're
                 going.  Put your hands on the wheel.

                              GLENN
                 You're gonna bust me for picking up a
                 car?

                              KAREN
                 For the car, for aiding and abetting a
                 prison escape, and conspiring to do
                 whatever you came here for.

                              GLENN
                 Listen, these guys, they're gonna be
                 out here any minute looking for me.
                 They're fucking animals.

                              KAREN
                 What's going on, Glenn?

                              GLENN
                 Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck
                 outta here.

                              KAREN
                 But I thought the whole thing was your
                 idea?

                              GLENN
                 Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but
                 these guys, man, they're into shit I
                 can't handle.

                              KAREN
                 Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?

                              GLENN
                 Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at
                 his office tomorrow, take him out to
                 his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I
                 don't give a shit what they do.

                              KAREN
                 And is Foley a part of this?

                              GLENN
                 He's supposed to be, but he hasn't
                 shown up yet, which is a good thing
                 for him.

                              KAREN
                 Why's that?

                              GLENN
                 Maurice is gonna kill him, try and
                 collect the reward.

                              KAREN
                      (beat)
                 But you say he hasn't shown up, you
                 think he backed out?

                              GLENN
                 I don't know-- he doesn't exactly
                 confide in me.

                              KAREN
                 Gee, I wonder why not.

                              GLENN
                 I'm freezing my ass off.

                              KAREN
                 You want to get out of here, run, it'll
                 warm you up.

                              GLENN
                 Really?

                              KAREN
                 But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to
                 me...

                              GLENN
                 I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I
                 believe it.  I keep thinking if you
                 hadn't driven me to federal court last
                 summer, you wouldn't even know who I
                 am.

                              KAREN
                 If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow
                 you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it
                 that way.  Go on.

     And he takes off.  She sits there another moment, then flicks
     her cigarette out the door, gets out the car.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

     Karen looks across the street at the theatre, sees people
     leaving.  A few seconds later, she steps behind a car and watches
     as Buddy and Foley pull into the lot.

     INT. THEATER - SAME

     Maurice sits with White Boy and Kenneth as Foley and Buddy come
     down the aisle to their table.

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been?  You miss the big boys,
                 come in time for the walkout fights.
                 Well, shit, you may as well pull up a
                 chair.

     Foley and Buddy remain standing.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, this is Mr. Jack Foley and
                 this is Mr. Buddy, famous bank robbers.

     Foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY
                 Who's sitting here?

                              MAURICE
                 Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he
                 went to the men's about a while ago
                 and never came back.

     Foley gives Buddy a look.  White Boy Bob grins at them.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I think he must've fell in.

                              MAURICE
                 I sent these two looking for him, they
                 come back shaking their heads.

                              FOLEY
                 Well, if he left his coat and he's
                 been gone a while.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 The car's still there.  I looked.

                              MAURICE
                      (to the ring)
                 Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push
                 him off.

                              FOLEY
                 We're leaving.

                              MAURICE
                 The fuck you talking about?

                              FOLEY
                 Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn
                 is...

     Maurice takes Foley by the arm, moves him away from the table.

                              MAURICE
                 Look, what you worried about Glenn
                 for?  What's he know?

                              FOLEY
                 I thought everything.

     Foley watches the fighters: one of them patient, moving in while
     the other one takes wild swings and misses...

                              MAURICE
                 Glenn knows everything we suppose to
                 do tomorrow.  Glenn could tell somebody
                 that, yeah, but it don't mean shit.
                 You understand?  'Cause Glenn don't
                 know I changed the plan.
                      (then)
                 It's happening tonight.

     Foley looks at Maurice now.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and
                 pick up what we need and go do it.

                              FOLEY
                      (beat)
                 Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 You got two minutes, that's all.  Make
                 up your mind.

                              FOLEY
                 I wasn't asking permission.

     Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 They want to go tonight, before Glenn
                 gets in any trouble, opens his big
                 mouth.

                              BUDDY
                 Whatta you wanna do?

     Foley takes out his lighter, begins playing with it.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 You know they gonna set us up.

                              FOLEY
                 I get that feeling, yeah.

                              BUDDY
                 But you still think you can get the
                 diamonds fore they do?

     Foley looks at him a moment, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here.
                 Right now.  I'll do the job with the
                 Snoop, meet you wherever you want and
                 give you half.

                              BUDDY
                 Half for doing what?

                              FOLEY
                 Getting me out of Glades for starters.

                              BUDDY
                 And who watches your back?

     ON MAURICE

     As he sits down with White Boy Bob and Kenneth, watches as Buddy
     and Foley talk up at the bar.

                              MAURICE
                 Man has all that reward on his head
                 and still talks like a con in the yard.
                 You know what I'm saying?  Like he's a
                 man you don't mess with.  Yeah, well,
                 what I say to Jack Foley is buuullshit.

     EXT. MAURICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     It's snowing as Maurice, White Boy Bob, Kenneth, Buddy, and
     Foley pile into the back of a van, the name of some plumbing
     and heating company on the side.

     We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that we're watching from inside Karen's
     car.  She waits for the van to pull away, then follows.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Kenneth -- the fucking maniac -- at the wheel.  Buddy and Foley
     piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and
     equipment.  Maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls.

                              FOLEY
                 That what they're wearing these days
                 to break and enter?

                              MAURICE
                 Break and enter, shit.  Take it and
                 git, how it's done.  Don't waste any
                 time.  That's how you do it.

                              FOLEY
                 So you've done this before, huh?

                              MAURICE
                 Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted
                 for it.
                      (then)
                 White Boy, tell these boys the reason
                 you went down on that burglary that
                 time.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 I left my wallet in the house I robbed.

     The guy grins at them.  Foley can't believe it.

                              MAURICE
                 Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit
                 and leaves his wallet on the floor.

                              FOLEY
                 That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm
                 very excited about tonight.

                              MAURICE
                 Hey.  You learn from doing.

     Foley and Buddy exchange looks.  Maurice turns around, a Beretta
     in his hand.  Foley looks at him.  Buddy tenses.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 You know how to use one a these?

                              FOLEY
                 I've seen 'em used on TV.

     Maurice hands Foley the Beretta.  Then reaches into a bag, comes
     up with a .38 he hands to Buddy.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     As Karen tries to keep up with the van.  But with the snow and
     the way Kenneth drives, she starts to lose them.  She speeds up
     around a corner and loses control of the car.

     EXT. STREET - SAME

     As Karen's car does a 360 in the ice and snow.

     INT. VAN - NIGHT

     Buddy and Foley are jostled about the back from Kenneth's insane
     driving.

                              BUDDY
                 Slow down.

     Kenneth grins in the mirror, punches it more.  Buddy gets out
     the .38 and touches it to the back of Kenneth's head.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Get ready to grab the wheel when I
                 shoot this asshole.

     Kenneth, his eyes freaked with speed, glares at Buddy in the
     mirror.

                              MAURICE
                 Do like he says, man.  Slow down.

     EXT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     As a pissed-off Karen gets out of her car, watches the van
     disappear.

                              KAREN
                 Shit --

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - SAME

     She takes out her cellphone, punches a number, re-orients her
     car at the same time.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     As the van creeps by one way, then the other, then pulls into
     the driveway.

     INT./EXT.  VAN - RIPLEY'S HOUSE

     All five of them in the back end of the van now, bumping into
     each other until Maurice lets White Boy out the rear end, leaving
     the doors open enough so he can watch.  He then racks the slide
     on a .45.

                              MAURICE
                 "An army .45 will stop all jive."
                 Huey P. said that.

                              BUDDY
                 You think he was talking about walking
                 into people's houses when he said it?

     Maurice looks at Buddy.  Buddy holds his gaze.  Then the coach
     lights on either side of the front entrance come on.

                              MAURICE
                      (pulls his mask down)
                 Get ready to go skiing.

     Now the front door opens...

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Here we go.

     We catch a glimpse of a WOMAN in the doorway, arms folded over
     her bathrobe as White Boy gives her a push and steps inside the
     house with her.

     Maurice is out of the truck and Kenneth, with a shotgun, is
     scrambling to be next.  Buddy catches him by his jacket collar
     and holds him squirming until Foley is out.

     The minute Kenneth's feet hit the driveway he turns the 12-gauge
     on Buddy, still in the truck.  Foley takes the barrel in one
     hand and shoves it straight up in Kenneth's face.

                              FOLEY
                 Go on in the house before you get hurt.

     Kenneth puts his face up close to Foley's and stares at him
     good before going inside.  Foley turns to Buddy...

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 There's still time, take me up on my
                 offer.

                              BUDDY
                 I'm not leaving you alone with these
                 assholes.

     INT. HOUSE - FOYER - SAME

     Where Maurice has the woman backed against a table.  She's in
     her forties, with thick red hair hanging free.  She looks ready
     to take a swing at whoever approaches...

                              WOMAN
                 I work here.  I'm the maid.

     Kenneth reaches out, opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy
     bra and low-cut panties before she slaps him away.

                              WOMAN/MAID
                 Fuck off.

                              KENNETH
                 Hey, shit, we're gonna have a party.

                              MAURICE
                 Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?

                              MAID
                 I told you, he isn't here.

                              MAURICE
                 Out for the evening?

                              MAID
                 He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.

                              MAURICE
                      (beat)
                 When's he due back?

                              FOLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what difference does it
                 make?  You want to wait for him?

                              MAID
                 Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
                 Christmas to Easter.

                              MAURICE
                 You here all by yourself?

                              MAID
                      (beat)
                 That's right, just me.

     Foley catches the hesitation, glances at Buddy.

                              MAURICE
                 Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his
                 valuables in.

                              MAID
                 I don't have any idea.

                              MAURICE
                 Let's go upstairs, have a look at the
                 man's bedroom.  All right now, you and
                 Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here.
                 Look at the wall behind any pictures
                 hanging on it.  Look at the walls in
                 the closets.  The man has a safe, it's
                 gonna be up there somewhere.

                              FOLEY
                 How about his place in Florida?  If
                 you'd called, we could've checked his
                 walls down there before we left.  That
                 is, if you'd checked to see where he
                 was.  You follow me?

     Maurice gives him a look, pulls the maid up the stairs.  Kenneth
     and White Boy Bob follow...

                              MAURICE
                 You set off any kind of alarm and you're
                 a dead Hazel.  Understand?

     Kenneth puts his arm around the maid.

                              KENNETH
                 What's you name, mama?

     He hooks a finger in the waist of her panties, pulls on the
     elastic, is about to look in there when Maurice backhands him
     across the face.

                              MAURICE
                 First money, then pussy.

     Alone with Buddy now, Foley rolls his mask up on his head.

                              FOLEY
                 You ever wear one of these?

                              BUDDY
                 I don't ski.

                              FOLEY
                 Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a
                 look around.

     INT. KAREN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Karen on the phone... snow falling all around her.

                              RAYMOND CRUZ (PHONE)
                 I'll send a unit over there, see if
                 there's anything going on.

                              KAREN
                 Tell me where Ripley's house is.  I'll
                 meet them there.

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 Karen, you gonna promise me you're not
                 gonna go in, do anything stupid till I
                 get there...

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

     Full of fat, cushy chairs and a sofa, everything white or black,
     a wet bar, a big TV, CD player.  Buddy moves into the doorway,
     peers inside.

     Kenneth is trying to find a radio station while Maurice and
     White Boy Bob ransack the place.  White Boy Bob checks under
     the mattress...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hey--

     Maurice and Kenneth look over expectantly.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 I found a rubber.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no
                 diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.

     Maurice looks out the door, sees Buddy in the doorway.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Where's Foley?

                              BUDDY
                 Checkin' the other rooms, like you
                 said.

                              MAURICE
                      (to White Boy)
                 Go keep an eye on him.

     White Boy Bob slips out of the room.  Maurice turns to Kenneth,
     who's still playing with the stereo.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Kenneth, fuck the radio, put on a CD.

                              KENNETH
                      (looking them over)
                 I don't recognize none of these bands.

                              MAURICE
                 Just pick one, put it on.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob watches from the end of the hall as Foley peers
     into each of the bedrooms.  Foley sees a back staircase and
     starts down.  A moment later White Boy Bob follows.

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes down the stairs.  No sign of Foley.  White
     Boy starts down one hallway, then turns back.  Now he's lost.
     He opens a door, starts to walk into a closet, then backs out.
     He goes down the hall, turns into...

     THE KITCHEN - SAME

     Where White Boy Bob enters, calls out tentatively.

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Uh, Foley?

     He takes in the huge room, the massive sub-zero refrigerator.
     He moves to the freezer, opens it, takes in the FROZEN STEAKS.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Cool.

     INT. HALLWAY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME 

     As Foley quietly moves to the doorway, peers into the kitchen,
     watches White Boy Bob starts going through the freezer, taking
     out steaks and stacking them up on the counter.  Foley shakes
     his head and moves on.

     INT. LIBRARY (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME

     Dark.  As Foley steps into the doorway, we BOOM DOWN to reveal
     a LIGHTED AQUARIUM in f.g.  He comes into the room, sits down
     in an armchair beside the fish tank.

     He leans close to the glass, stares at the fish a moment.  He
     sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room,
     sees how the phone cord disappears underneath.

                              FOLEY
                 They cut the lines, Richard.

     Silence.  The door opens and we see a terrified Richard Ripley
     sitting on top of a toilet, the phone in his lap.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley?  That you?

                              FOLEY
                 How are you, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Jesus Christ, what the hell are you
                 doing here?  What's going on?  Who's
                 upstairs?

                              FOLEY
                 Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.

                              RIPLEY
                 Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.

     Ripley moves to the doorway.

                              RIPLEY (CONT'D)
                 Have they got Midge up there?

                              FOLEY
                 What kinda man lets a woman answer the
                 door, this time a night?

                              RIPLEY
                 We thought it might be her husband.
                 Sometimes he comes and checks up on
                 her.  She told him I was down in
                 Florida.

                              FOLEY
                 A minute or two, you're gonna wish you
                 were.

     Ripley looks at him.  Foley pats the back of a chair.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you come on over here, sit
                 down, Richard, have a look at your
                 fish.

     EXT. BLOOMFIELD HILLS - ROAD - SAME

     As Karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     The music ON LOUD (Herb Alpert -- Tijuana Taxi).  Buddy stands
     in the doorway, watches Maurice, out of his coveralls, as he
     takes suits and sport coats from the walk-in closet to look
     them over.  He tries on a coat, turns to the maid.

                              MAURICE
                 How do I look, mama?

                              MAID
                 Like a fag.

     Maurice smiles at her, goes back into the closet.  Kenneth stares
     at the maid, nodding slowly.

                              KENNETH
                 I think she like to tussle with me.
                 Get boned a way she gonna remember.

     She looks to the doorway, where Buddy now starts to take a step
     into the room, when Maurice comes out of the closet...

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Motherfucker!

     He sticks his head out of the closet.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 I found the safe.

     Buddy backs out of the room.

     EXT. RICHARD RIPLEY'S HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen drives slowly past the house.  White Boy Bob emerges
     with an armload of steaks and sets them on the front steps.

                              MAURICE
                 White Boy!  Get your ass up here!

     White Boy Bob hurries back into the house.

     INT. RIPLEY'S LIBRARY - SAME

     Ripley sits on the couch across from Foley.  He keeps looking
     up at the ceiling.

                              RIPLEY
                 What do you want from me, Jack?  Name
                 it.  You want money?

                              FOLEY
                 You gonna write me a check?

                              RIPLEY
                 We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a
                 withdrawal.

     Foley just looks at him.  Buddy sticks his head in the room.

                              BUDDY
                 They found the safe.

                              FOLEY
                 You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?

                              BUDDY
                 Yeah, hi.  Nice house.

                              RIPLEY
                 Thank you.

     INT. BEDROOM - CLOSET DOORWAY - SAME

     White Boy Bob comes in as Kenneth and Maurice are getting ready
     to blast the safe with the shotgun and pistol.

                              MAURICE
                 We gonna open up this fucker...

     Maurice and his boys open fire on the safe.  The maid covers up
     as bullets begin ricocheting all over the room.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Jesus...!

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     Karen sees the muzzle flashes in the upstairs window and quickly
     gets out of the car.

     INT. STUDY - SAME

     As Buddy and Ripley look up.

                              RIPLEY
                      (gets up)
                 Good God... they're shooting Midge!

                              FOLEY
                      (pushes him down)
                 Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open
                 the safe, not your maid.

     INT. BEDROOM

     As Maurice, Kenneth and White Boy Bob get ready to fire again.

                              MAURICE
                 A'ight, this time we gotta get the
                 motherfuckin' trajectory right...
                      (pause)
                 Okay, on three:  One... Two...

                              MAID
                 The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

     They all turn to look at her, guns still pointing at the safe.

                              MAID (CONT'D)
                 Richard's birthday.

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     As Karen cautiously makes her way towards the front door.

     INT. BEDROOM - SAME

     As Maurice finally gets the safe open.  They all anxiously peer
     inside.  Maurice narrows his eyes, reaches in, pulls out one of
     three toupees.  He stares at it.

                              MAURICE
                 ...the fuck is this...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Are they dead?

     He looks at White Boy Bob...

                              MAURICE
                 Go find Foley.  NOW!

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Foley leans forward in the chair now...

                              RIPLEY
                 I can't believe you're still angry
                 with me, Jack, after all this time.

                              FOLEY
                 I'm not angry, Richard.
                      (staring at the tank)
                 In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing
                 is, I can't tell if it's the fish
                 that're cooling me out or all those
                 uncut diamonds on the bottom of the
                 tank there.

     Ripley sags, closes his eyes.

                              BUDDY
                 Damn--

     And now Buddy takes a closer look and now we, too, see that
     strewn about the bottom of the aquarium are dozens of uncut
     diamonds of various sizes.

                              FOLEY
                 Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about
                 five million worth in there, wouldn't
                 you say, Richard?

                              RIPLEY
                 Five point two.

                              BUDDY
                 They look like plain old rocks.

                              FOLEY
                 They sure do.

     He gets up, looks at Buddy.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 Go get a bag.

     Foley turns to Richard as Buddy comes back into the room with a
     plastic bag, starts reaching into the tank.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I were you, I'd get up and run.

                              RIPLEY
                 I'm not leaving Midge.

                              FOLEY
                 Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're
                 gonna kill you.

                              RIPLEY
                 If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not
                 leaving.
                      (then)
                 I love her, Jack.

     Foley looks at Buddy.  Now what?

                              BUDDY
                 C'mon.

     Foley just looks at Ripley, who doesn't move.

                              FOLEY
                 Good luck, Richard.

                              MAURICE (OS)
                 Someone down here?

     Buddy and Foley slip out the other door, down the hall, just as
     Maurice walks in, some of Ripley's clothes over his arm.

                              MAURICE (CONT'D)
                 Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.

                              RIPLEY
                 Are those my suits?

                              MAURICE
                 Where you been hiding, Dick?

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME

     A now-freezing Karen hugs a retaining wall, watches as Foley
     and Buddy emerge from the house.

     AT THE VAN

     As Buddy leans under the dash.  Foley looks up at the house
     where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window, hear
     the faint pumping of the music.  We hear the VAN START.

                              BUDDY
                 Okay.

     Buddy straightens up, looks at Foley.

                              BUDDY (CONT'D)
                 Come on.

                              FOLEY
                 Shit.

                              BUDDY
                 What?

                              FOLEY
                 They're gonna rape the maid, aren't
                 they.

                              BUDDY
                 From the looks of those boys, the
                 Ripper too.

                              FOLEY
                 And then they'll kill 'em.

                              BUDDY
                 At least.

     Foley looks at the diamonds in the bag.

                              FOLEY
                 We made it, didn't we?

                              BUDDY
                 All you gotta do is get in.

     Again Foley looks at the diamonds, then...

                              FOLEY
                 I'm going back inside.

                              BUDDY
                 I'll go with you.

     Foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it...

                              FOLEY
                 No, you dump the van, meet me at the
                 airport.
                 I'll take one of Ripley's cars.

                              BUDDY
                 Jack --

                              FOLEY
                 Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about
                 to go down, you'll be on the phone
                 with your sister for a month.  Let me
                 do this part alone.

     Buddy just looks at him.

                              FOLEY (CONT'D)
                 I'm saying this isn't your problem.
                 Far as I'm concerned, we're square.

     Foley turns to go.

                              BUDDY
                 Hey...

     Buddy hands him his gun.  Foley takes it, stuffs it in the back
     of his pants, and then turns back to the house.

                              FOLEY
                 Now get outta here.

     KAREN
     
     As she watches Foley go back inside.  A moment later, the van
     pulls out of the driveway.  Karen makes a decision, starts for
     the side of the house...

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE - THE FOYER - SAME

     Foley enters and we hear the maid scream.  Foley starts up
     the stairs.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY

     Maurice and White Boy Bob both have their guns to Ripley's head.

                              RIPLEY
                      (hears the scream)
                 Midge.

                              MAURICE
                 Forget about her.  Tell me where the
                 money's at.

                              RIPLEY
                 Foley's got it.

                              MAURICE
                 Where the fuck is Foley?

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - SAME

     Foley comes up the stairs, heads for Ripley's bedroom.  The
     door is closed now...

                              FOLEY
                 Midge?

     He steps to one side, is about to reach for the knob when
     suddenly the DOOR IS BLASTED OFF ITS HINGES.

     INT. KITCHEN (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME TIME

     Karen comes through the door, hears the gunshot, stops cold.

     INT. HALLWAY (UPSTAIRS) - SAME

     As Foley steps into the doorway and we see Kenneth and the maid
     bare, both sitting up in bed, Kenneth racking the shotgun, the
     maid turning away from him, gathering the covers that hang off
     her side of the bed...

     ...and coming around to throw them like a net at Kenneth as the
     shotgun goes off and the covers catch fire as Foley pumps one
     two three shots into Kenneth somewhere under there.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Ripley tries to get away...

                              RIPLEY
                 Midge!

     Maurice grabs him by the collar, spins him around and whips him
     across the face with his gun.  He and White Boy Bob then both
     hit Ripley on the head until he goes down and stays down.

                              MAURICE
                      (to WBB)
                 You take the front stairs, I'll take
                 the back.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As the maid jumps up and drags the burning covers from the bed
     and sees Kenneth now, the bullet holes in his chest, staring
     blankly back at him.  She then looks at Foley.

                              MAID
                      (cold)
                 Where's Dick?

                              FOLEY
                 Downstairs.
                      (then)
                 But wait here.  There's two more.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley starts out of the room and immediately hears...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Hold it, asshole!

     Foley sees White Boy Bob at the bottom of the stairs.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Drop the gun.

     Nowhere to go, Foley has to comply.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Now stay right there.  Don't move.

     White Boy Bob starts to jog up the stairs two at a time, all
     the while keeping his eyes fixed on Foley.

                              WHITE BOY BOB (CONT'D)
                 Maurice!  I got Foley!

     INT. RIPLEY'S BACK STAIRCASE - SAME

     As Maurice starts up the backstairs...

                              WHITE BOY BOB
                 Maurice!  Up here!

     ...and a moment later, Karen comes out of the kitchen into the
     downstairs hallway -- just missing each other.

     INT. STAIRCASE - SAME

     As White Boy Bob gets maybe half way up when he catches a toe
     on one of the risers and pitches forward.  Stupidly, he tries
     to break his fall with the elbow of his gun hand and ends up
     jamming his chin down onto the muzzle of his gun which,
     unfortunately for him, goes off, firing a bullet through his
     head and killing him instantly.

     To say the least, Foley is stunned by this freak accident.  He
     stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs.

                              FOLEY
                      (finally)
                 You learn from doing.

     Foley bends down to pick up his gun and we see MAURICE COMING
     UP THE BACK STAIRCASE, his gun raised, and now firing away...

     Foley is forced to jump back behind a pillar as Maurice keeps
     firing at him, shots ricocheting off the pillar, the railing,
     the wall...

     INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Karen hugs the wall at the sound of gunshots, sees Ripley
     lying on the floor of the study...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As we hear CLICK as the breech opens on Maurice's now empty .45
     And now Foley steps out from behind the pillar and calmly bends
     down, picks up his gun, Maurice still walking forward...

                              MAURICE
                 Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?

                              FOLEY
                 Not until recently.

                              MAURICE
                      (still coming)
                 Nervous?

                              FOLEY
                 A little.

                              MAURICE
                      (getting close)
                 This kind of setup, you don't have any
                 idea what the fuck you're doing -- do
                 you?

                              FOLEY
                 You're right.  So why take a chance--

     Foley pulls the trigger.  CLICK.  Maurice hesitates, surprised
     that Foley would pull the trigger, then the two of them at the
     same time rush each other, begin a messy mano a mano, now using
     their spent guns as bludgeons.

     INT. RIPLEY'S STUDY - SAME

     As Karen carefully comes into the room, Ripley lets out a low
     GROAN.  She's bending down to check him when HER PHONE RINGS.

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley and Maurice grapple on the floor near the head of the
     stairs.

     INT. STUDY - SAME

     As Karen answers her phone, checks Ripley...

                              KAREN
                 Hello?

                              CRUZ (PHONE)
                 We're a few minutes away.  Just sit
                 tight, stay outta the house till we
                 get there, understand?

                              KAREN
                 Oh-kay...

     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

     As Foley finally shoves Maurice down the stairs.  Maurice rolls
     down a few steps, right over White Boy Bob, as...
     
     Foley gets up, runs back to the bedroom.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley enters, goes straight to Kenneth's body, begins
     searching for the shotgun (lifting the covers, turning over
     the body, etc) with no success...

                              FOLEY
                 Shit...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk
     of White Boy Bob.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley, exasperated, stands back up...

                              MIDGE (O.S.)
                 This what you want?

     Foley looks to where Midge stands -- now back in her bathrobe,
     but more importantly, clutching the shotgun.  Foley crosses and
     takes it from her, begins to stride out of the room, when --

                              MIDGE (CONT'D)
                 It's empty.

     Foley just looks at her.

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice finally rolls White Boy Bob over, grabs the gun...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Foley sticks his hand in Kenneth's coveralls, comes out with
     a shell, loads the gun, snaps it shut...

     INT. STAIRWELL - SAME

     As Maurice cocks the pistol, takes a step up the stairs...

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Maurice--

     Maurice spins around, points his gun down at Karen, now standing
     in the foyer, her own gun pointing up at him...

     EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

     As Raymond Cruz and several green-and-whites arrive...

     INT. RIPLEY'S BEDROOM - SAME

     As Jack, about to exit, stops cold as he HEARS TWO GUNSHOTS,
     then a BODY FALL.

     He stands still.  Not sure who was just shot.  After a long moment,
     we then hear:

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He sees Midge looking at him, closes his eyes, sags against the
     wall.

                              KAREN (OS) (CONT'D)
                 I know you're up there.

     INT. FOYER - SAME

     As Foley steps into the hallway, his ski mask now pulled down
     over his face.  He holds Kenneth's shotgun in one hand and his
     pistol in another.

                              KAREN
                 Come on, Jack -- don't.

                              FOLEY
                 Pretend I'm somebody else.

                              KAREN
                 You think I'd shoot you?

     Foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun.  AND NOW WE HEAR
     THE SIRENS...

                              FOLEY
                 If you don't, one of those guys will.

                              KAREN
                 What're you now, a desperado?  Put the
                 guns down.

                              FOLEY
                 I told you, I'm not going back.

     He raises the guns hip-high and we hear sounds behind Karen,
     but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or
     look around.

                              KAREN
                 Don't do this.  Please.

     They stand there staring at each other.

                              FOLEY
                 No more time outs.

     He raises the guns.  She sadly shakes her head.

                              KAREN
                 You win, Jack.

     She fires and he falls to the staircase, dropping the guns,
     grabbing hold of his right thigh.  And now Cruz and several
     other cops enter... Karen motions them to stop...

                              CRUZ
                 Karen, I told you not to--

                              KAREN
                 Wait, I know him --okay?

     She goes up the staircase to where Foley is lying and gently
     lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot
                 you.

                              FOLEY
                 You just did, for Christ sake.

                              KAREN
                 You know what I mean.

     She glances about, makes sure no one can hear, then leans closer
     to him.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I wish things were different.  I'm
                 sorry, Jack.

     Foley looks like he's in pain.  He watches as she walks back
     down the stairs.  As a couple of uniform cops rush past her and
     pick up Foley, a shaky Ripley staggers into the foyer.

                              MIDGE
                 Richard!

     She comes running down the stairs into his arms.  They embrace.
     He looks at Foley over her shoulder...

                              RIPLEY
                      (sympathetic)
                 Listen, Jack...
                      (but then)
                 What'd you do with my diamonds?

     Foley just looks at him.

     EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT

     As Buddy pulls the van into an alley.  He jumps out, jogs back
     to the street and hails a cab...

     INT. CAB - SAME

     Buddy suddenly gets in, bangs on the bulletproof glass.

                              BUDDY
                 The airport.

     The cab pulls away.  Buddy glances up front, then pulls the
     Ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up.  There's a bit of
     water in along with the diamonds.  A tiny fish swims in the
     water.  Something about this makes Buddy smile as we...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. KAREN'S HOTEL - MORNING

     The sun is out.  The sky is clear.

                              KAREN (VO)
                 They don't know yet if they want to
                 bring him up on the homicides.

     INT. KAREN'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

     Karen on the phone.  Her suitcase on the bed.

                              KAREN
                 I doubt if they will.  The Bureau's
                 put a detainer on him, so when they're
                 through with him here he'll go back to
                 Florida.

     INT. MARSHALL SISCO'S SITTING ROOM - SAME

     Marshall on the phone...

                              MARSHALL
                 You gonna go get him?

                              KAREN
                 It's possible.  Why?

                              MARSHALL
                 I was just thinking... you could have
                 a nice time with him on the plane --
                 like picking up where your interlude,
                 or whatever you call it, left off.
                 And then throw him in the can.

                              KAREN
                 He knew what he was doing.  Nobody
                 forced him to rob banks.

                              MARSHALL
                 My little girl, the tough babe.

     Karen hangs up, stares thoughtfully out the window.

     INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

     Where Foley stands staring out of his window.

                              VOICE
                 Foley.

     As Foley turns around and faces a FEDERAL MARSHAL in the doorway,
     we see that Foley's hands and feet are shackled.

     INT/EXT. PRISON STATION GARAGE - DAY

     The Marshal leads Foley from the building to where a black
     government van waits.  The Marshal helps Foley inside.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Have a nice trip.
                      (looks OS)
                 I'll get the other one.

     INT/EXT. VAN - SAME

     As Foley sits down, stares at the floor.  He looks depressed.
     We hear the front door open, then close.

                              KAREN (OS)
                 Jack?

     He looks to where Karen looks at him through a steel grate that
     separates the front from the back.

                              KAREN
                 I got you a present, something for the
                 road.

     She pushes A ZIPPO THROUGH the grate.

                              KAREN (CONT'D)
                 I have to take it away, though, soon
                 as the ride's over.

     Before Foley can say anything, the back door is opened once
     more and the Marshal helps ANOTHER PRISONER -- a black man with
     a shaved head -- into the back of the van.

                              FEDERAL MARSHAL
                 Jack Foley meet Hejira Henry.

     An annoyed Foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the
     door then gets in up front with Karen.

                              FOLEY
                 Hejira?  What kinda name is that?

                              HEJIRA
                 Islamic.

                              FOLEY
                 What's it mean, "No Hair"?

                              HEJIRA
                 The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed
                 from Mecca in 622.

                              FOLEY
                 The flight?

                              HEJIRA
                 The brothers in Leavenworth gave me
                 the name.

                              FOLEY
                 You were at Leavenworth, huh?

                              HEJIRA
                 For a time.

                              FOLEY
                 Meaning?

                              HEJIRA
                 Meaning time came, I left.

                              FOLEY
                 You busted out?

                              HEJIRA
                 I prefer to call it an exodus from an
                 undesirable place.

                              FOLEY
                      (interested now)
                 And how long was it before they caught
                 up with you?

                              HEJIRA
                 That time?

                              FOLEY
                 There were others.

                              HEJIRA
                 Yeah.  That was the ninth.

                              FOLEY
                      (really interested)
                 The ninth?

                              HEJIRA
                 Ten, you count the prison hospital in
                 Ohio I walked away from.

                              FOLEY
                 You must be some kinda walker, Henry.

                              HEJIRA
                 Hejira.

                              FOLEY
                 And so now you're off to Glades.

                              HEJIRA
                 Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to
                 leave last night with the lady marshal,
                 but for some reason she wanted to wait.

                              FOLEY
                      (looks at Karen)
                 She did, huh.

                              HEJIRA
                 Cheaper I guess, take us both down in
                 one van.

                              FOLEY
                 Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought
                 we'd have a lot to talk about.

                              HEJIRA
                 Like what?

                              FOLEY
                 I don't know.
                      (then)
                 It's a long way down to Florida.

     Foley glances at her, then turns back to Heiira Henry and
     considers the guy; a smile on Foley's face, his spirits a little
     higher than when he first sat down, as we then...

	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	
	
	
	                     This film is short.
	
	                     This film is fast.
	
	
	
	FADE IN:
	
	EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY
	
	The whole island, from the south.  For a second.  Literally.
	
	EXT.  NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY
	
	Closer, just the skyline.  For another second.
	
	EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY
	
	Closer still, the Upper West Side.  For another second.  No
	time to waste admiring the scenery.
	
	EXT.  WEST 83RD STREET - DAY
	
	Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women
	hurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate
	broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a
	stride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with
	her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine
	year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a
	basketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher
	than Meg, who she resembles.
	
	Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          -- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five
	          feet deep, forty-two hundred square
	          feet, four floors with a rentable
	          basement apartment, so five
	          altogether, courtyard in back --
	
	                     MEG
	          Could you slow down a little?
	               (looking back over her
	                shoulder)
	          Or we could wait for the car...
	
	                     LYDIA
	          No cars.  Feet are faster.
	
	                     MEG
	          How many more do we have after this?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          None, there's nothing else, you know
	          how tight the market is.
	
	                     MEG
	          This is it?  I told you on the
	          phone, I have to be moved in in two
	          weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce
	          that here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom, it's the sidewalk.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, that miserable little prick is
	          already leaving.
	
	They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
	townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
	more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
	door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them
	coming.
	
	                     EVAN
	          One day you will learn to respect
	          other people's time, Lydia, one day
	          you --
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Evan, I am so sorry, you were a
	          saint to wait for us!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	Evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of
	the townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks
	fast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,
	Sarah still bouncing her basketball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          This is the middle of the house, the
	          entry floor, living room's over
	          there.  The kitchen floor's below us
	          and there's two bedroom floors
	          above.
	
	The front door closes behind them, with a THUD so
	authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg
	tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop
	bouncing the ball in the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's an enormous amount of space for
	          the money and I'll be perfectly
	          honest, the family is in no hurry
	          whatsoever.
	
	Meg whispers Sarah's name, but Sarah still ignores her, goes
	on bouncing the ball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I don't have to tell you there is an
	          acute shortage of living space in
	          Manhattan right now and this is a
	          highly unique property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          No ball, kid.
	
	Sarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the
	living room, peers through the big French doors, which look
	out over the courtyard area.  There's another row of
	brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to
	one another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.
	
	Sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the
	window.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg
	watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.
	Can't.
	
	Evan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style
	elevator.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,
	          the previous owner, was disabled the
	          last ten years of his life.  Highly
	          unusual, the elevator, you will not
	          find this in ninety percent of
	          brownstones.
	
	                     MEG
	          Will they take asking price?  I need
	          a two week escrow and I'm already
	          approved for the loan.
	
	Lydia turns, gives Meg an "are you insane?" look.
	
	                     EVAN
	          What say we see the house before we
	          dicker, hmm?
	               (starting up the stairs)
	          I have to warn you, this is exactly
	          the response we expected to get.
	          It's a very emotional property.
	
	As he disappears upstairs, Lydia turns to Meg, lowers her
	voice.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Who taught you to negotiate?
	
	                     SARAH
	          It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't
	          have to pay the price on the tag.
	
	She gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a
	bang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,
	turns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we
	notice her thin hand is shaking.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...
	          money, and... this is more my
	          husband's area.
	
	She digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some
	water.
	
	                     MEG
	          Was.  His area.  I'm not very good
	          at...
	
	Lydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for Meg to
	finish her sentence.  Not very good at what?
	
	                     MEG
	          Things, and if I can't prove to my
	          soon to-be ex-husband that I can
	          provide a suitable place for our
	          daughter to live in the next
	          fourteen days, it's going to get
	          ugly between us.  Uglier.
	
	Lydia just looks at her, no idea what to say.  These two are
	from different places.
	
	                     EVAN (O.S.)
	               (from upstairs)
	          It would be so lovely if I could
	          shot the property before I leave!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Evan, Lydia, and Meg poke their heads in a series of rooms,
	one after the other, the tour flying by quickly.  First, an
	upstairs bedroom.  Nice, roomy, looks out on the courtyard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one
	          bathroom.
	
	INT.  DEN - DAY
	
	Another floor, another empty room.  The trio passes through.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
	          what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used
	          it as an office.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low voice, to Meg)
	          He's talking about Bernard
	          Pearlstine.
	
	Meg shrugs, who's that?
	
	                     EVAN
	               (moving, through a
	                bathroom)
	          Master bath.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          The hotel guy?  It's been in the
	          papers lately.  His kids are all
	          suing each other over his estate.
	          He was a total recluse, paranoid,
	          rich as hell, he was worth thirty
	          million or something, now it turns
	          out they can't find half of it.
	               (singsong)
	          Somebody took something didn't
	          belong to them!
	
	                     EVAN
	          I hardly see how family gossip is
	          germane to showing the property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low, to Meg)
	          Stop calling it the property, you
	          sound ridiculous.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (through a closet)
	          Master closet.
	
	From the hallway, there is a GROANING METALLIC sound, the
	elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
	puts it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his
	mouth hurts when he moves it.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Could the child please stop that?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
	
	She looks at Meg and winks.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	                     EVAN
	          And we emerge in the master bedroom.
	
	He checks his watch.
	
	Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She
	looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next
	door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the
	window wall.  She takes two steps back from it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Something's weird.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          What?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, doesn't that corner
	          seem funny to you?
	
	She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to
	the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the
	closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look
	closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
	toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which
	the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
	it is.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I was waiting to see if you'd
	          notice!  On caravan, no one from our
	          office had the slightest idea.
	
	He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a
	faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He
	pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty
	degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
	closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look
	closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.
	
	Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,
	twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and
	the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and
	Lydia step forward, fascinated.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY
	
	From the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we
	see the three of them standing in the open doorway,
	silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
	windows behind them.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's called a panic room.
	
	He hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.
	
	                     MEG
	          A what?
	
	                     EVAN
	          A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A
	          castle keep, in medieval times.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, I've seen these...
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's quite in vogue in high end
	          construction right now.  One really
	          can't be too careful about home
	          invasion.
	
	The other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door,
	looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
	-- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope,
	clothes, blankets -- you get the idea.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Hey, this is perfect for you...
	               (Meg scoffs)
	          Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're
	          living alone now.  Your alarm goes
	          off, or you head glass break, or for
	          whatever reason you think someone's
	          broken into your home in the middle
	          of the night.  What are you going to
	          do?  Call the police and wait until
	          they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse
	          downstairs in your sexy little
	          underthings and check it out?  I
	          think not!
	
	                     EVAN
	          Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried
	          phone line, completely separate, not
	          connected to the house's main line
	          and never exposed throughout the
	          house's infrastructure or outside
	          the house -- you can call the
	          police; nobody can cut you off.
	          Your own ventilation system,
	          complete with oxygen scrubber, so
	          you've got plenty of fresh air for
	          as long as you like.  And a bank of
	          video monitors --
	
	He hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors,
	revealing a dozen different views of the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          -- covering almost every corner of
	          the house.
	
	Meg nods, starting to sweat.
	
	                     MEG
	          Makes me nervous.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Why?
	
	                     MEG
	          Ever read any Poe?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          I don't think so, but I love her
	          album.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, Edgar Allen.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (thinks)
	          The furniture guy?
	
	                     MEG
	               (giving up)
	          What's to keep them from prying open
	          the door?
	
	Evan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall
	behind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door
	leaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a
	submarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place
	inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Steel, four inches thick.
	
	Meg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Everything's spring-loaded, even if
	          the power's out it's fully
	          functional.
	
	                     MEG
	          Open it.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with
	          this room, did he?
	
	                     MEG
	          Open the door.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          And with kids like he's got, no
	          wonder he wanted a place to hide.
	
	                     EVAN
	          That's highly inappropriate.
	
	                     MEG
	          I said open the door.
	
	Evan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open,
	recoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little
	girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          My room.  Definitely my room.
	
	She bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining
	her composure.  Not crazy about tight spaces.  Which we
	already knew.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          That door is a safely hazard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Not at all.
	
	He points.  There's a tiny red beam that shines across the
	doorway, one at shoulder height --
	
	                     EVAN
	          Infrared.  Like the beam in an
	          elevator doorway.  Won't let the
	          door close if something's blocking
	          it.
	
	-- and one at shin height.  Even bend down, blocks the one at
	shin height with his hand.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Watch.
	
	He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand
	anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (to Lydia)
	          Push that button for me, will you?
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't!
	
	Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens.  Evan pulls
	his hand put of the beam, takes a step back.  Lydia pushes
	the button again.
	
	WHANG!  The metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang
	reverberating in the room.  Almost immediately, the fake
	piece of wall HUMS shut, of its own accord, followed a moment
	later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of
	the closet door and HUMS silently back into place, closing
	over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like
	a corner again.
	
	As the mirrored door closes, it shows Meg her own reflection.
	She looks at herself, still rattled.  She wipes a trickle of
	sweat from the side of her face.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	The same house, two weeks later.  The entry floor is piled
	high with moving boxes.  Sarah and Meg lie sprawled out in
	the middle of the black and white tile, arms and legs splayed
	wide, exhausted.
	
	They stare up at the ceiling, beat.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Too many stairs.
	
	                     MEG
	          Got us in here, didn't I?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Shoulda got an apartment.
	
	                     MEG
	          Well, I know that now.
	
	                     SARAH
	          478-0150.
	
	Meg raises her hand to her face, she's got her cell phone in
	her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          Battery's dead.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY
	
	Meg picks up the wall phone in the kitchen, gets a dial tone.
	
	                     MEG
	          The phone works.
	               (to Sarah)
	          Hey, I hooked up the phone.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (sarcastic)
	          The crowd goes wild.
	
	                     MEG
	               (ignoring the slight)
	          478...
	
	                     SARAH
	          0150.
	
	Meg finishes dialing.  It rings, someone answers.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Perry's Pizza, please hold.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Night has fallen.  Meg and Sarah sit at a small table in the
	middle of the kitchen, surrounded by packing boxes.  They eat
	pizza.  They chew, silently.  Sarah drinks a diet Dr.
	Pepper.  Meg finishes a glass of wine.
	
	Meg's eyes are moist.  Sarah notices.  She notices her
	noticing, shrugs.  I'm human, what do you want me to do, hide
	it?
	
	Sarah looks away, goes back to chewing.  After a moment:
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck her too.
	
	Meg looks at her, not sure how to confront the open defiance.
	
	                     MEG
	          I agree.  But don't.
	
	Sarah stares at her for a moment, then goes back to eating.
	
	Meg picks up the bottle of wine.
	
	Sarah's eyes flick over and watch as wine GLUGS into her
	mother's glass.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah's bedroom is full of unpacked boxes, but her twin bed
	has been set up and Sarah is in it, hair wet, pajamas on.
	She reads from a book ("Tom Swift and His Repelatron Skyway")
	while Meg, drowsy, lies next to her, listening.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Tom's throat felt so dry and tight
	          that it was a moment before he could
	          make any sound come out.  "Dad!" He
	          croaked.  "I'm - inside - the -
	          machine!" "Great Scott!"  The elder
	          scientist gasped.  He dashed across
	          the laboratory and switched off the
	          repelatron's motor.  "What happened,
	          son?" "The Durafoam hardened, Dad.
	          Get a solvent, quick -- you know the
	          formula!"
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bathroom, Meg soaks in a bath.  She is
	exhausted.  She reaches for her wine glass, finishes the last
	of it.
	
	She stretches for the bottle, which is on the floor next to
	her.  She refills the glass.  Again.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, dressed in an old Knicks T-shirt and boxer shorts,
	stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom, reading
	from an instruction manual.  She's frustrated.  She mutters,
	slurring, a bit drunk.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... shunt,
	          enter, zone number...
	
	She tries it, pushing a few buttons, but the alarm panel
	BEEPS at her disapprovingly.  She's doing something wrong.
	
	She sighs, sits on the floor, gets serious about figuring out
	the instructions.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... ah, shunt,
	          enter, shunt again, zone number...
	          wait...
	
	HER FINGERS
	
	dance over the alarm panel, some time later.  She seems to
	have figured it out, and a small light on the panel lights
	up.
	
	SYSTEM ARMED
	
	The very moment the red light goes on, we cut sharply to --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the darkened panic room, where the dozen small video
	screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of
	the house.  Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably
	not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on
	for the night.
	
	The door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
	hangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has
	made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must
	have been playing here before bed.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom.
	
	She fills a glass of water, puts it on a box she's using for
	a night table.
	
	She plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone, places the
	phone in the cradle.  It BEEPS.  "Charging."
	
	She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of
	water.  It's 12:26.
	
	She gets in bed, her side, the left side.
	
	She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from
	her.
	
	We drift off her, see the clock again.  The time changes, the
	number one dissolves away, changing the time to --
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the
	door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and
	down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,
	still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping
	even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the
	ground floor.
	
	We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the
	canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on
	the street.
	
	We move right up against the window, peer through the glass
	just as --
	
	-- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see
	through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the
	driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark
	clothes.
	
	The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across
	the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.
	
	He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.
	We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.
	
	But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in
	again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.
	
	The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,
	which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.
	Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.
	
	He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,
	onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't
	tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for
	something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.
	
	The fire escape.
	
	The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of
	vision.
	
	We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We
	start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in
	the kitchen, toward the stairwell.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw
	earlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through
	the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the
	way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were
	looking down.
	
	A skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move
	up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside
	the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house,
	and just as we near the skylight --
	
	-- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark
	clothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the
	skylight, looking at us without seeing us again.
	
	He steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends
	to enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on
	the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling.
	
	Here in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door
	is ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet.
	
	IN THE CLOSET,
	
	it's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver
	of light appears, coming from above.  We look up.
	
	There is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet,
	it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling.
	
	Roof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so
	slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting.
	A shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
	edges of the portal.
	
	It slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for
	something.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The
	silver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a
	moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel:
	
	ZONE 19 DISABLED
	
	INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT
	
	In the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof
	access panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the
	night sky above.  But we're inside.
	
	And in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down,
	through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and
	climbs silently down the ladder.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In bed, Meg stirs.  An alcohol sleep is a restless one, and
	she's suffering.
	
	She sits up groggily, chugs a glass of water.  Lies down
	again.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for
	the stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's
	going, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs,
	happens to glance to the side as he does so.
	
	He freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top
	floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly
	disturbs him.
	
	A nightlight.  Plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
	bathroom.  (For the record, it's the Power Puff Girls.)  The
	Man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of
	the bathroom.  He looks from the nightlight to the
	countertop.
	
	There's a moving box on the countertop.  His eyes widen.
	This is news to him, bad news.
	
	He takes a step back and a breath.  He turns, looks to the
	end of the hall.  His eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he
	notices something he didn't see before, something coming from
	under the door to the fourth floor bedroom.
	
	Light.  From inside.  From another nightlight.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another
	outlet.  Nearby, Sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked
	off.
	
	The door to Sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly.
	The Man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the
	mountain of moving boxes piled in the room.  His gaze falls
	on Sarah in the bed.
	
	The Man just stares, beside himself.  His lips mouth a word,
	soundlessly.  Doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg flops over in bed, facing away
	from the doorway, really having a rough go of it.  She slept
	too hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her,
	she's really paying the price of four glasses of wine.
	
	She lies still, on her side, facing us.
	
	Behind her, the bedroom door moves, silently.
	
	Opening.
	
	The Man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just
	pushed open.  He stares at the sleeping form of Meg on the
	bed, whose back is to him.  He has no idea she's awake.
	
	Meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a Man is standing in
	the doorway to her bedroom.
	
	Noiselessly, the Man moves away, down the hall.  The moment
	his head disappears down the stairwell --
	
	-- Meg flops over again, facing the doorway.  She closes her
	eyes, gives sleep another try.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The Man walks across the kitchen, shaking his head in
	exasperation at the packing boxes all around him.  He goes to
	the front window, peers outside.  He reaches for a light
	switch on his right.
	
	Through the window, we can see the stoop light go on.  Then
	off, then on and off again.
	
	Still through the window, we see the side panel door of the
	van slide open.
	
	TWO MORE MEN climb out.  They are also dressed in dark
	clothes.  They also carry satchels.
	
	They walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window
	as they approach us.  The first intruder (who has a name,
	it's BURNHAM) steps over to the kitchen door, runs his
	silvery strip through the gap.  Another HUM and spark.
	
	AN ALARM PANEL
	
	flashes again.
	
	ZONE 1 DISABLED
	
	IN THE KITCHEN,
	
	Burnham opens the kitchen door, letting the two other guys
	slip inside.  RAOUL is a hulking figure whose back seems to
	rise up over the top of his slouching head; when he walks it
	looks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him
	forward.  JUNIOR is much smaller, very high-strung, dresses
	like a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the
	street is Park Avenue.
	
	They all freeze, staring at the moving boxes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          A woman and a little girl, both
	          asleep upstairs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Keep your voice down.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This was your department, Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's why the key didn't work, they
	          changed the locks.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen day escrow, man, that's
	          almost three weeks!  They shouldn't
	          be here for another week!  They
	          don't own this house yet!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (pause)
	          Exactly how is fourteen days almost
	          three weeks?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen business days.  Escrow is
	          always business days.
	
	Burnham sighs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I mean, right?  Isn't it?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You're an idiot.
	
	Raoul steps forward, shoves Burnham with both hands in the
	chest.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Watch your mouth.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's okay, Raoul.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Junior)
	          Who is this guy?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul is cool.  That's all you need
	          to know.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is insane.  I'm outta here.
	
	He starts for the door.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We
	          can still handle this.
	               (to Raoul)
	          Can we still handle this?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          It's just the woman and the kid?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Unless Daddy comes back later.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Daddy's not coming back, she's in
	          the middle of a divorce, it's just
	          the two of them.  We're okay, here.
	               (to Raoul)
	          We can do this, right?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're fuckin' A we can do this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not with me.  Not with people.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Forty-five minutes.  That's all you
	          said you need.  That's like nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She'll call the cops, they'll be
	          here before I get unpacked.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can
	          totally administrate that part.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No problem.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I don't want Raoul to administrate
	          that part.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They won't get hurt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?  What if she has a
	          gun?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul, what in God's name do we do
	          if she has a gun?
	
	Raoul pulls up his sweatshirt, revealing a .38 tucked into
	his belt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Asshole.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and
	          you insult him?  Hey, who's the
	          idiot?  Huh?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Where did you get this clown?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I met him at the tables, same as
	          you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we
	          have a little muscle right about
	          now.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What tables?  I've never seen him
	          before.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Different tables.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Raoul)
	          The fuck did you bring a gun for?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're welcome.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Peace out.
	
	He moves for the door.  Junior, trying desperately to hold
	this together, gets there first, blocks the door with his
	back.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We can't do it without you, Burnham.
	
	Junior starts at Burnham.  Raoul stares at Burnham.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's still a good plan.  It's
	          just... got a twist.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Kidnapping.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't
	          kidnap somebody in their own house.
	          It's just breaking and entering,
	          unless we take 'em someplace.  Or
	          something like that, I'm pretty
	          sure.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Pure idiot.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An
	          idiot's grandson.  I'm third-
	          generation idiot.  But for once in
	          my life I had a good idea, and I'm
	          not giving up so easy.  You are?
	          Are you actually telling me that for
	          the first time in your life you're
	          gonna throw your cards on the table
	          and go home early?  I can't believe
	          my eyes.
	               (Burnham hesitates)
	          Fourteen million dollars upstairs,
	          Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole.
	          Baby, you'll be so far out of the
	          hole you could draw bricks every
	          night for the next twenty years and
	          still shit green.
	               (Burnham sways)
	          Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg sits up in bed.  She's bleary, her head feels like
	someone rested a manhole cover on it.  She gets up, in the
	dark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her
	way with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark.
	
	She steps through the door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	She walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light
	switch, but can't find it.  She blinks, squints, tries to get
	her bearings.  The only light is a harsh white glow that
	comes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video
	monitors.
	
	She finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds
	her.  She's not in the bathroom.  She's wandered into the
	panic room by mistake.
	
	She turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind
	her.
	
	We linger for a look at the video screens.  If only she'd
	done the same, she'd see what we see.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a
	group, silently debating what to do.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Using the light that spills from the open door to the panic
	room, Meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the
	proper door to the bathroom.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg SNAPS the cap off a jug of Advil and dumps three into her
	palm.  She pops them in her mouth, searches for a glass for
	water, finds none, bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them
	down.
	
	She turns to the toilet.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the monitor, we see the three men leave the kitchen and
	start up the stairs.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands, flushes the toilet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Burnham, Raoul, and Junior freeze, just
	coming up the stairs from the kitchen.  They look up, hearing
	the water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly
	above them.
	
	They stare at the ceiling, following with their eyes as a
	pair of feet pad across the CREAKY floor.  Finally, they hear
	a SQUEAK of bedsprings as Meg climbs back into bed.
	
	They hold a moment longer, a silence grows.  Raoul reaches
	into his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask.  He pulls it
	over his head.  They look at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (whispers)
	          No face.
	
	Burnham rolls his eyes.  Doesn't know this guy much, but
	hates him so far.  They start across the foyer toward the
	stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over, to go back to sleep.  She sees she's left the
	lights on in the panic room.  She TSKS, gets out of bed, and
	walks across the floor toward it.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light
	switch --
	
	-- and stops, her hand frozen in mid-air.  She cocks her
	head, looking at something she can't understand.
	
	She blinks.  Takes a step, further into the room.  She stares
	at the video monitors -- at the three men in dark clothes,
	stealing silently across the foyer.
	
	This can't be.  These are just pictures, they have no
	relation to reality.  She drops to her knees, her face inches
	from the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying
	to make sure they're really there.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	They reach the base of the stairs, Junior in the lead.  As he
	reaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot
	short on an angled step and it slips off.  He trips, falls
	forward.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Watching the video monitors, Meg stares in horror as the
	image of Junior slipping is verified by the SLAP of his hands
	on the stairs as he catches himself, audible through the open
	door to the panic room.
	
	She GASPS.  It is real.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Burnham's eyes are wide as saucers,
	staring at Junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet.
	
	Junior points at Raoul, speaks in an urgent whisper.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Top floor, get the little girl and
	          keep her there.  I'll bring the
	          woman up.  Gimme.
	
	He holds out his hand for the gun and Raoul gives it to him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (points to Burnham)
	          Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.
	
	He heads for the stairs.  Raoul follows close behind him.
	Burnham stays, reluctant -- what the fuck has he gotten
	himself into?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg moves.  Leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races across her bedroom, flies out the door, and bolts
	up the carpeted stairs, headed for the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's room, drops onto the bed, and grabs
	Sarah by the shoulders, trying to rouse her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up... wake up...
	
	But she's in a profound child's sleep and won't wake up.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Junior and Raoul reach the third floor
	landing.  Still moving stealthily, Junior heads down the hall
	for the master bedroom, where he thinks Meg is sleeping.
	Raoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is desperate, still can't wake Sarah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up...come on, come on...
	
	She sees a plastic cup on her night table/box, half filled
	with water.  She snatches it and tosses the water in her
	face.
	
	Now she's awake.  And pissed off.  She SPUTTERS, SHOUTS.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, at the base of the stairs that lead to the top floor,
	hears the kid shouting.  He starts up the stairs, quickly.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the top floor, Meg is already dragging Sarah out of the
	room and into the hallway.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah come out of Sarah's bedroom just as Raoul
	reaches the top of the stairs at the other end.  They're cut
	off.
	
	Meg freezes, staring at the hulking ski-masked figure at the
	end of the hallway.  She thinks, no idea what to do for a
	second.  She looks frantically to her right -- the bathroom,
	dead end.
	
	She looks to her left.
	
	The elevator.
	
	She yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and
	races inside with Sarah.
	
	Raoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg SLAMS the gate shut and PUNCHES the button for the first
	floor.  The elevator GROANS to life and starts down --
	slowly.
	
	Sarah looks up at her, terrified.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What's going on?!
	
	                     MEG
	          People.  In the house.
	
	As the elevator descends, they see Raoul, through the window
	in the door, as he drops to his knees, to get a good look at
	them.
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul turns from the elevator, SHOUTS to the open stairwell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED
	          TOWARD YOU!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and
	races back down the hall, toward the elevator.  He reaches
	the door, peers through the window.
	
	He sees the bare feet of Meg and Sarah, dropping toward him.
	He grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it
	stays locked, with the elevator moving beyond.
	
	He bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop.  As
	Meg and Sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to
	moving eye with her for a moment.  But the elevator doesn't
	stop, it keeps going down.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands frozen, terrified, staring at Junior as they move
	past him.
	
	Junior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can,
	actually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving,
	the catch holds fast and the door won't open.
	
	As they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior flies down the stairs, to cut them off at the first
	floor.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          He's going down.
	
	                     SARAH
	          That room!
	
	                     MEG
	          What?!
	
	                     SARAH
	          PANIC ROOM!
	
	Meg thinks, then punches the button for three, to go back up.
	
	But the elevator continues down.  She jabs at it, futilely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.  you gotta...
	
	She reaches past her, pushes the STOP button.  The elevator
	jerks to a halt.  Then Sarah pushes three.  Now the elevator
	starts to rise.
	
	Meg looks at her, impressed.  Love that kid.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	In the foyer, Junior freezes, hearing the elevator stop and
	start again.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
	
	He takes off up the stairs again.  Burnham can't take it
	anymore, he takes off after Junior, following him upstairs.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, still on the top floor, heads for the stairs, fast.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior races back up the stairs.  They have her caught in the
	middle.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	The door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate
	RATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off
	down the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.
	
	Raoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah run through the master bedroom.  As she passes
	the night table, Sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell
	phone from its cradle.  But in her haste she starts to pull
	it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the
	charger.  The phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the
	corner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under
	the bed.
	
	Sarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as Junior
	turns the corner and Raoul thunders down the steps from four.
	
	She abandons the phone, grabs Sarah, and they lunge through
	the open doorway to the panic room.
	
	Junior and Raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom,
	just a few steps away.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the
	doorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door
	wide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at
	the red button on the wall --
	
	-- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --
	
	-- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive
	coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the
	steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --
	
	-- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior SLAMS into the closing metal door, banging his
	shoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over and pulls Sarah into her arms, both of them
	breathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out
	of their minds.
	
	But safe.
	
	She spots the telephone, the one with the special buried
	phone line.  She lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle,
	listens for a dial tone.
	
	Nothing there either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	                     SARAH
	          It doesn't work?!
	
	                     MEG
	          Different phone line, I never hooked
	          it up!
	
	She hurls it down, looks back at Sarah.  She seems a bit
	pale, scared.  She goes to her, holds her, reassures her.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior is slumped at the base of the door, livid, in pain,
	pounding on it with his fists, screaming "NO!" over and over
	again, crazy with rage.
	
	Raoul stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving, hands
	on his knees.
	
	Burnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway,
	looks from Raoul to Junior to the door to the panic room,
	figures out the situation.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me... tell me they're not in
	          there...
	
	We rise up, above them, above the room, looking down on them,
	the rats-in-a-maze shot.
	
	We rise up further still, above where the ceiling ought to
	be, to look down on this room and the one beside it, the room
	behind the four inches of reinforced steel, the panic room in
	which Meg and Sarah kneel in the middle of the floor, holding
	each other tight.
	
	Standoff.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Very close on the metal door, from inside the panic room.  An
	ear moves slowly into frame, presses against the cold steel.
	Listens.
	
	Meg pulls away from the door, shaking her head.
	
	                     MEG
	          Can't hear a thing.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do they want?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't
	          know.
	
	She sits back against a wall, looks around, at the tiny room.
	She's trying not to show how freaked out she is.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do we do?
	
	                     MEG
	          Wait.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if they get in here?
	
	                     MEG
	          They can't.  They can't get in here.
	          No.  They can't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I heard you.
	
	                     MEG
	          Feel okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Yeah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shaky?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Nope.
	
	                     MEG
	          Chills?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	She checks her wristwatch, for some reason.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Don't worry about me.
	
	The implications being, worry about yourself.
	
	Sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies
	them.  Meg crawls over to join her.  They scan the screens.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there are a dozen different views of the house.  Front stoop.
	Kitchen.  Dining room.  Entry floor.  Living room.  Master
	bedroom.  Den.  Top floor bedrooms, both of them.  Top two
	floor hallways.  Even one with a shot of the inside of the
	elevator.
	
	The three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing
	in a tight circle, having a hell of an argument.  Lots of
	gesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a
	word.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the
	right of the video monitors.  She slides over, studies a
	panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small
	grilled area.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey...
	
	Sarah joins her, looks at the buttons.  Each one is labeled
	with a different room name -- den, kitchen, master bedroom,
	etc.  Up in the corner there is a button that says "ALL
	PAGE," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked
	"TALK."
	
	Meg looks at Sarah.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Go ahead.
	
	Meg is reluctant, frightened.  Sarah is encouraging, for the
	first time.
	
	                     SARAH
	          You can do it.
	
	Meg leans forward, clears her throat.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham, Raoul, and Junior are standing in the half-darkened
	living room, in the middle of their argument, when a VOICE
	booms around them.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Excuse me.
	
	They practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for
	the source of the voice.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          The police are on their way.
	
	Only Burnham has remained relatively calm.  After he gets
	over the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera
	that's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and
	stares up at it.  Raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is
	careful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back
	to it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I suggest you leave.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a
	finger from side to side.  He raises a hand, makes a gesture
	like a telephone, then wags his finger again.  The message is
	clear -- you don't have a phone.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is puzzled.
	
	                     MEG
	          How'd he know that?
	
	She presses the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Take what you want and get out.
	
	That sounded fairly tough.  She looks at the monitor again.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then
	they all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning
	in circles, looking for something.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah watch them, confused.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham holds up a finger to the camera -- wait a second --
	while Raoul and Junior rush off screen, looking for
	something.  Junior returns a moment later holding something
	and the three of them hunch over a box, working on something.
	
	After a moment, they break apart and Junior steps up to the
	camera holding a pad of paper.  He shows it to the camera.
	On the top page, in big block letters, they've written.
	
	WHAT WE WANT
	
	After a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second
	page, where four more words are written.
	
	IS IN THAT ROOM.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah GASPS, Meg sits back.
	
	                     MEG
	          "What we want is in that room."
	
	                     SARAH
	          They're coming in here, aren't they?
	
	                     MEG
	          No, I told you, they can't.  It's
	          not a possibility.
	
	Angry, she sits forward and jabs the talk button.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          What do you know about this room?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first
	draft of a response torn up.  Finally, Junior steps forward
	with another sign:
	
	MORE THAN YOU.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's confidence is ebbing, but she doesn't want to show it.
	She hits the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          We're not coming out.  We're not
	          letting you in.  Get out of my
	          house.
	               (clicks off)
	
	                     SARAH
	          Say fuck.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Fuck.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Get the fuck out of my house."
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Get the fuck out of my house!
	
	She clicks off again, looks to Sarah for approval, and gets
	it, sort of, in Sarah's half-smile.  But Sarah's eyes go back
	to the screen.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Answer.
	
	Meg follows Sarah's eyes back to the screen, where another
	message is being held up for them.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the notepad says:
	
	WE WILL LET YOU GO.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah speak at the same time.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, please.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Give me a break.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, her voice booms from the speaker.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Conversation's over.
	
	With an audible CLICK, she signs off.  Burnham, Raoul, and
	Junior stand arrayed beneath the camera, staring up at it,
	dumbfounded.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Got her right where you want her,
	          Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When you said you'd let 'em go I
	          thought she'd come running right out
	          for sure.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up and let me think.
	
	He opens a pack of cigarettes, takes out a joint and lights
	it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'm afraid to let you think, Junior.
	          Things get worse when you think.
	               (sniffs)
	          Oh, that's gonna help.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (holding in a hit)
	          Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are
	          we gonna do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What if she called the cops?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She didn't.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She said she did.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She lied.  Cops woulda been here by
	          now if she called 'em.  Besides,
	          Junior cut the phones.
	
	Burnham goes to the window and stares outside.  He laughs,
	covers his face.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What the fuck is funny about this?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          There is not one thing funny here.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Who else but God could think this
	          shit up?  I spend ten years building
	          those fucking rooms to keep people
	          out, now I gotta figure out how to
	          get in.  God, man, He just loves the
	          irony.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic
	          and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are
	          you gonna get us into that room?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in
	          the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          So what the fuck are we supposed to
	          do?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Make her come out.  And when she
	          does, that's when we gotta be
	          careful.  She can't get out of this
	          house.  She can't even think she can
	          get out of this house.  We just keep
	          them here and keep them quiet for
	          forty-five minutes.  And I don't
	          want
	               (Raoul)
	          Joe Pesci here standing over them
	          with his fat sweaty finger on the
	          trigger.  That's a sure way for us
	          to end up with two dead bodies and
	          little puffs of smoke burning out of
	          our heads up in Greenhaven.  So
	          we're gonna seal the place up.  They
	          wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll
	          help 'em.  Make it impossible for
	          them to leave.  Once they come out
	          of that room.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And why exactly would they want to
	          come out?
	
	At the window, Burnham notices something sitting just outside
	the French doors, on the balcony.  It's a large outdoor
	barbecue grill.  He thinks, takes a step closer.
	
	He sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the
	grill.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Workin' on it.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg is sitting cross-legged on the floor,
	leaning against a wall, but Sarah is in motion, sorting
	through shelves, opening drawers.  Every drawer has something
	in it, sealed under plastic.  She opens and closes, sorts and
	lifts finds the following:
	
	Waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	Flashlights.
	
	Unopened packages of batteries.
	
	Sealed water bags stamped "PURE FIVE YEARS FROM DATE."
	
	Tinned food.
	
	Flares.
	
	Pillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are
	stamped FIREPROOF BLANKET).
	
	A complete tool kit.
	
	As Sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at
	the end of the room, down on the floor at eye level.
	
	It's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a
	four-pronged cloverlike seal.  The portal is closed tight, as
	Sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it
	resists her attempts to crank it open.
	
	Meg notices.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey.  Relax, okay?
	
	But Sarah keeps at it, feels along the edges of the portal,
	then all along the wall, looking for some kind of hidden
	switch that controls it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I mean it, lie down.  You get your
	          adrenaline up and you know what's
	          gonna happen.
	
	Sarah stops, looks at her mother, who is pale and wan,
	huddled in the corner.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you freaking out?
	
	                     MEG
	          Little bit.  Yeah.
	
	Sarah looks around the room.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Small space?
	
	                     MEG
	               (nods, fast)
	          Don't though.
	               (talk about it, that is)
	
	Sarah looks at her, thinks.  It's not an unfamiliar
	situation, her needing to comfort her mother.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          What am I, a five year old?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          To prove he wasn't chicken.
	
	Meg tries to push a smile across her face, but it's
	immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens.
	Her eyes show alarm, staring at the kitchen.
	
	                     MEG
	          What the hell are they doing?
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The contents of one of the satchels is dumped out over the
	kitchen counter, every kind of tool imaginable, many that are
	unfamiliar to us.  They sort through the pile, choosing
	things.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN FLOOR - REAR DOORS - NIGHT
	
	At the French doors that lead to the garden, Burnham has a
	cordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand.
	He reaches up, drills a screw through the door, into the
	corner of the door frame.  He does the same at the bottom of
	the door.
	
	He unlocks the doorknob, tries it.  The screws hold the door
	fast.  He moves on, to the next door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg stares at the video screens, eyes
	wide, terrified.  She watches them.  Can't take her eyes off
	them.
	
	                     MEG
	               (barely audible)
	          ... locking us in...
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	In the library, in the front of the house, Raoul screws shut
	a window, driving the long screws into its frame.  He looks
	out at the street, at two CLUBGOERS walking home.
	
	He pulls the drape.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg's hands are over her mouth, she's trembling, shaking her
	head from side to side.  This can't be happening.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	In the kitchen, Junior goes to the wall phone Meg used to
	call for pizza earlier.  He cuts the phone wire with a
	knife.
	
	He stands there, staring at the phone, wiping the sweat from
	his palms on his pants.  Not satisfied, he pulls the phone
	itself out of the wall, cuts the cord for the handset too.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg pushes herself back into the corner of the panic room,
	horrified.  Sweat has broken out on her forehead, her whole
	body seems to vibrate.  Sarah comes over, leans in front of
	her.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom?
	
	But Sarah's voice is hollow, seems far away.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you okay?
	
	Meg looks at her.  As she watches, Sarah floats away from
	her.  In fact, the entire room is floating away from her,
	elongating.
	
	And narrowing.  Meg looks to the sides, and the walls don't
	just seem like they're pushing in on her, they are pushing in
	on her.
	
	Meg opens her mouth, screams, but no sound comes out.
	
	Sarah stands up and bends over her, but now she's just a
	figure far away, all the way at the end of a long, impossibly
	narrow hall.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (barely heard)
	          MOM?!  MOM!!
	
	Meg crawls out, into the middle of that hallway, to get away
	from the wall, but they both continue moving in on her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Not here... not here... someplace
	          else... someplace else...
	
	Her eyes roll back into her head, we see just the whites, and
	she loses her balance, falling over onto her back.
	
	We fall with her, move in tight on her face, and the dark
	hallway carpet beneath it turns to green, all green, grassy
	green.  She sits up, looks around, and we realize she is in
	fact somewhere else, she's --
	
	EXT.  GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	-- in the middle of the Great Lawn, in Central Park.  She
	stands, turns in a circle, she's completely alone on the
	great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring
	day, tall buildings sparkling in the distance.
	
	Meg stretches her arms out, smiles, but far off in the
	distance, she hears a voice calling to her, dimly:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom?!  Mom!!
	
	Meg ignores the voice, she's so happy to be out here, out in
	the open, in the beautiful wide open, she could stay here
	forever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's
	that voice again, insistent:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom, please!!
	
	There is the sharp sound of a SLAP, and Meg's face abruptly
	jerks to the side.  She touches her cheek, confused, as a hot
	red handprint rises up on it.
	
	What the hell was that?
	
	BAM!
	
	Now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
	deafening CRUNCH.  The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she
	turns.  Where did that come from?
	
	BAM!  Another one, even louder.  Meg's whole body winces at
	the sound.
	
	BAM!  A third one, and on this one Meg falls to her knees,
	covering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on
	the Great Lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and
	she's right back --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- in the panic room, where she always was, and that pounding
	is real, it's right outside the door, it's like somebody's
	trying to smash their way right through the wall.
	
	Sarah is right over Meg, holding her by the arms, and that
	handprint on Meg's face is real, Sarah must have slapped her
	to try to bring her out of it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING
	          IN!
	
	Meg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another
	deafening BANG crunches into it from outside.
	
	BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  The sound is deafening.  Sarah throws both
	hands over her ears.  Meg looks around, still disoriented.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK
	          OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY
	          HERE WITH ME!
	
	                     MEG
	          I am.  I'm here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU HAVE TO!
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm here.  I'm here.
	
	They huddle there, terrified.  Meg blinks, wipes the sweat
	from her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her
	head, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,
	tries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an
	ordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing
	digital display:
	
	120
	
	Meg nods, as if reassuring herself.
	
	                     MEG
	          We're fine.  We're okay.
	
	She turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell
	they're doing out there.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	BAM!
	
	In the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the
	sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
	
	The intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is
	like a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
	end of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the
	hole.
	
	As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall
	behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and
	beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.
	
	But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,
	reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into
	the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham
	tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the
	duct.
	
	CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.
	Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.
	This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along
	with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists
	it into the drill.
	
	At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.
	A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit
	tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size
	of a quarter.
	
	Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a
	coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul
	tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in
	the air as it snakes across the room.
	
	Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's
	just drilled in the air duct.
	
	RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
	connection, makes it airtight.
	
	SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot
	section of the garden hose off the coil.
	He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five
	gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor
	up here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of
	the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red
	block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.
	
	PROPANE
	CAUTION - FLAMMABLE
	
	Along with a number of other dire warnings.
	
	Burnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't
	really want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either.
	
	He spins it open.  Halfway.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I did.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He said open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Just sending a message.  She'll get
	          the point.
	
	Gas HISSES through the spigot and into the hose.  We follow
	along the length of the hose, across the floor of the room,
	through the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been
	drilled in the air duct --
	
	INSIDE THE WALL
	
	-- through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines
	of an air vent up ahead.  We squeeze between two of the
	horizontal lines --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and come out in the panic room.  Three red streamers, tied
	to the air vent, flap to life as the gas HISSES into the
	panic room.
	
	Directly underneath the vent, Meg is hunched up against the
	wall, her arm around Sarah.
	
	She sniffs.
	
	Again.
	
	Sarah sniffs.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	She looks up.  Sees the streamers floating above her.
	
	She leaps to her feet, steps up onto a shelf, and stretches
	her nose toward the streamers.  Just as she does --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Near the tank, Raoul shoves Burnham out of the way.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We ain't playin', here.
	
	He cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way.
	The gas pours into the hose with an audible WHOOSH.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, at the vent, falls back, two lungfuls of propane, and
	drops to her knees on the floor.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What, what, what is it?!
	
	                     MEG
	          On the floor!  Get on the floor!
	
	Now Sarah coughs.  The gas is pouring into the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul is standing guard over the tank, to make sure no one
	messes with the valve.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Look, don't be stupid...
	
	Junior has his head pressed against the door to the panic
	room, trying to hear any sounds from within.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Be quiet.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're trying to scare them, not kill
	          them!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're coughing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          They're gonna die in there!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Nobody is gonna die, man, will you
	          please have the balls to follow
	          through with a good idea?  Think
	          about it, what would you do if you
	          were them, stay in there and choke
	          to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're
	          just getting them to come out for
	          forty-five minutes, forty-five
	          fucking minutes!  The worst that's
	          gonna happen is they pass out, we
	          drag 'em out here into the fresh
	          air, and they'll be fine.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are
	          we supposed to get into the room if
	          they pass out?
	
	Pause.  Junior turns to Raoul.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Cut it back a little bit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No fucking way.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          He's right, we can't get into the
	          room if they're dead!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their
	mouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not
	working.  Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near
	to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing
	again.
	
	Finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the
	clover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.
	
	The portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a
	tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source
	directly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends
	down and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at
	the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside
	through it.
	
	She sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her.
	She does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of
	the tube, gulping fresh air greedily.
	
	Meg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor
	at the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.
	Burnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on
	the valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and
	hurls him aside.
	
	Burnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at
	Raoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,
	trying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their
	voices down.
	
	It's bedlam.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She
	turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the
	streamers still stream.
	
	She looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found
	the waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	She thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
	and crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches
	up a screwdriver.
	
	Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,
	but can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.
	
	In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
	blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her
	disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of
	air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.
	
	She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the
	shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the
	vent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,
	she unscrews the vent cover.
	
	The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,
	past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the
	wall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her
	fingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it
	once.
	
	Too slow.  Not even a spark.
	
	Her hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with
	the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it
	makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the
	duct with a hollow BOOM.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns abruptly.
	
	He turns around.  They all freeze, listening.  He hears it
	again.  The hollow BOOM, coming from inside the wall.  Now a
	third time.
	
	He walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.
	
	BOOM.
	
	He moves closer, gets right up next to the wall.  He leans
	into the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct.
	This close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's
	two sounds.
	
	SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	He arches an eyebrow.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	Meg's hand is trembling, tiring.  She tries again, thumbs the
	flint wheel.  It SCRATCHES as it rolls, her hand twitches,
	BOOMS against the side of the duct.
	
	Still, the gas HISSES through.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face is turning color, she's running out of air.  Her
	feet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	she tries again.  SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	Burnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh.
	
	He tears himself away from the wall --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn --
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	-- Burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the
	propane tank --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and
	a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the
	panic room, the other toward the bedroom.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from
	the vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame.
	She drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's
	body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into
	a lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent
	light tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through
	the hose, backing up toward the tank.
	
	Burnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the
	other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue
	flame erupts from the end of the hose.
	
	The flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire,
	his chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the
	blankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS
	and rolls on the floor in pain.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
	another angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame
	that Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one
	of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a
	flickering, uneven light on the room.
	
	She stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,
	breathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making
	no sense whatsoever.
	
	She stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed
	admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.
	
	Meg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned
	off.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the
	shoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.
	
	Meg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Out in the bedroom, it's worse for Burnham, who has lost most
	of his hair and shirt.  But his skin isn't badly burned,
	which is something, I guess.
	
	Still, he's in a rage.  He POUNDS the metal door of the panic
	room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM
	          COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN
	          THERE!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg whirls, goes to the door herself, SCREAMS right back.  We
	can hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds
	threatening.
	
	Suddenly, she stops, hearing something else.  Outside the
	door, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound,
	a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall
	that's shared with the brownstone next door.
	
	It's a faint -- very faint -- POUNDING sound, along with a
	high pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be
	heard.  Sarah hears it too.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Neighbor!
	
	Meg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING
	at the tops of their lungs -- get help, call the police,
	please, call the police, that sort of thing.
	
	They shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if
	their voices are as soft on the other side as the COMPLAINING
	VOICE is on this side, they have no hope.
	
	Their voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by
	the gas to shout for very long.  Long after they stop, the
	soft POUNDING from next door continues.
	
	Their pleas are not heard.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The Intruders have stopped their racket too, and are
	listening carefully at the common wall.  Eventually, the soft
	POUNDING stops, the complaining voice complains no more.
	
	Burnham stands there, in pain.  Things are falling apart.
	Raoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway
	light.  He draws himself up to his full, bulky height.  He's
	big.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (to Junior)
	          We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.
	
	Junior nods and starts out.  Raoul lets him pass, but when
	Burnham tries to follow him, Raoul puts a big hand on his
	chest stopping him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You stay.  Make sure she don't come
	          out.
	
	Burnham swallows.  But stays.
	
	Raoul turns, follows Junior downstairs.  As he descends, he
	looks up, making eye contact with Burnham.  And holding it.
	Something on his mind, that's for sure.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	THUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the
	floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.
	
	But Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,
	rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea
	forming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight
	and loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing
	around the room.
	
	Halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she
	flashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?
	
	Sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
	discovered earlier.  She squints through it.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the
	brownstone.
	
	About thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
	brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because
	the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can
	see straight into somebody's bedroom.
	
	There's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book
	on his chest.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sits back.
	
	She grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the
	top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.
	Shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a
	wall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to
	the tube.
	
	Meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah
	shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving
	enough room on either side of it for them to see through.
	Meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside
	her.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?
	
	Sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on
	the top of the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the
	courtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.
	The light flashes on the wall over his bed.
	
	The flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long.
	Long.  Long.  Short.  Short.  Short.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns to Sarah, impressed.
	
	                     MEG
	          Morse code?
	
	                     SARAH
	               (nods)
	          Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	          dot.
	
	                     MEG
	          Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Titanic."
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the flashes continue -- dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	dot.  But the Man continues to sleep, the light on the wall
	behind him has no effect.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah is frustrated.  She adjusts the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is
	shining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot.  She's
	starting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the
	watch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:
	
	114
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man stirs.  Opens his eyes.  Winces from the
	light, which is flashing directly in his eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Got him!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Come on, come on...
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man sits up.  Raises a hand, trying to block the
	light, which keeps flashing on him.
	
	He gets up, out of bed.  He comes to the window.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, yes, yes, yes...
	
	Sarah keeps it up, flashing faster.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	they see the Man come all the way to his window.  He leans
	against it, cups his hands so he can see better.  The flashes
	continue, right on top of him now.
	
	Clearly, the Man is reading the flashes!  He takes a steps
	back from the window --
	
	-- gives them the finger --
	
	-- and angrily yanks shut his drapes.
	
	A moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah drop their heads to the carpet, defeated.
	
	Sarah rolls over, knocks the flashlight away, stares up at
	the ceiling.
	
	Meg puts a hand in her hair.  It was a good idea.
	
	                     SARAH
	          We're never getting out of here.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shhh...
	
	She looks at the wristwatch again.
	
	103
	
	She's concerned.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is concerned as well.  He's still in the master
	bedroom, but barely, he's standing in the doorway, straining
	like hell to hear a conversation that Junior and Raoul are
	having in the foyer, one floor one.
	
	They're trying to keep their voices down, but stray words
	float up through the open stairwell -- words like "him" and
	"warning" and "dangerous."
	
	Burnham chews a fingernail.  If only he could get closer.  He
	throws a look back at the door to the panic room.  He looks
	back out the bedroom door.  Listening.
	
	INT.  FOYER - NIGHT
	
	Junior and Raoul are huddled together in the foyer.  They're
	keeping their voices low, but their conversation is heated.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're not gonna do anything about
	          him, he's fine.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          If you think I'm gonna let my half
	          of the fourteen million bucks slip
	          away because of --
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          "Half?"  What did you, take a nap in
	          math class?  Three people, three
	          shares, one third.  Four point six
	          six six repeating.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I'm just saying, the man is a
	          problem.  And he's your problem.
	          Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your
	          idea, none of this was your idea, it
	          was mine, it's my family we're
	          ripping off, it's my prick
	          grandfather who built that fucking
	          room, it was my idea to get the
	          plans, I found the floor safe, and
	          it was my idea to ask a guy who
	          builds these rooms to help break
	          into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at
	          no point did I say "you" or Raoul,"
	          got it?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He puts his hands on me again I'll
	          bury a slug in his ear.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          No, you will not, because without
	          Burnham there's no way in hell we're
	          gonna get into that safe, so as far
	          as I'm concerned he can paint your
	          ass blue and run it up a flagpole
	          and you won't lay a finger on him,
	          you understand me?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't take no tone of voice with me,
	          Homes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          What is this shit you're talking all
	          of a sudden?  You're a bus driver,
	          "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so
	          please don't start spouting some
	          Elmore Leonard shit you just heard
	          because I saw that movie too,
	
	ON THE VIDEO MONITORS,
	
	Junior and Raoul are visible, still arguing in the foyer.
	
	On the next monitor over, Burnham is visible, standing in the
	master bedroom doorway, listening.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is watching the monitors, thinking.  She notices
	something, sits forward abruptly, looking at the monitor that
	covers the master bedroom.  She squeezes right up close,
	staring at the screen.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	we peer closely at the box next to her bed, the one she was
	using for a night table.  On top of the box, she sees the
	charger for her cellular phone, sitting empty.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back, eyes alive with an idea.  If only she could
	get to that phone, which must be still under the bed.  She
	looks back at the monitors, at Burnham lingering in the
	doorway to the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn.
	
	She turns away from the monitors, to check on Sarah, who's
	settled into a corner of the room, looking pale.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham is desperate.  The argument
	downstairs is entering round two, and he's got to hear what
	they're saying.
	
	He takes a few steps out of the bedroom --
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	-- and comes into the hallway.  He leans over the stairwell.
	Where he's standing, he is directly under the camera that
	covers the hallway --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- and can't be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns back from Sarah, to look at the monitors again.
	She see Burnham is no longer in the bedroom.  And doesn't
	appear to be in the hallway, either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh yes, yes...
	
	She looks at another monitor.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	she sees Junior and Raoul in the foyer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back.  That leaves Burnham unaccounted for.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... the hell is he?
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham is still lingering under the camera.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah has come forward to the monitors as well.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Do it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah, but where's the third guy?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
	
	Meg goes to the door, raises a hand to the green "open"
	button.  Hesitates.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we see Burnham, lurking in the hallway, just about six feet
	from the door to the panic room.  Don't open that door!
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg wipes sweat from her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          If it looks like I can't get back,
	          just close the door.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.
	
	                     MEG
	          Close it!
	
	Sarah nods, looks back to the button.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	a shouted CURSE rises up from downstairs.  Burnham takes a
	step toward the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	he suddenly appears, in the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WAIT!
	
	Meg freezes.  She looks at the monitor, wide-eyed.  Close
	one.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham can't take it anymore.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, hell...
	
	He turns and takes off down the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer, next
	to Junior and Raoul.   
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah see all three men accounted for, downstairs.
	
	                     SARAH
	          GO GO GO!
	
	Meg leaps up, runs to the door, and punches the green button.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The door begins to crank open, Meg slips through the gap
	sideways before it's even all the way open.  She darts across
	the room --
	
	-- slides to the floor next to the bed --
	
	-- and flattens herself, reaching underneath it to get the
	phone.  Damn, that phone slid far, it's right in the middle,
	wouldn't you know it.
	
	IN THE FOYER,
	
	the three men hear her footsteps, as one, they take off for
	the stairs.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg continues to stretch, her fingers inches from the phone.
	
	ON THE STAIRWELL,
	
	feet race up toward her --
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg's fingernails paw the phone, pull it closer to her.  She
	grabs it, stands --
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	the three men come off the stairs and race toward her, they
	see her as she lunges across, toward the panic room, she
	hurls herself through the door --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	-- and Sarah SMACKS the red button.  The steel door closes
	with a deafening WHANG.
	
	Safe.
	
	IN THE ENTRYWAY,
	
	the echo of the metallic WHANG reverberates through the
	house.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg punches 9-1-1 on her cell phone with
	trembling fingers.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The big empty charger cradle is in the foreground when the
	three men burst into the room.  Burnham stops in the middle
	of the floor, turns in a frantic circle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What'd she get, what'd she get,
	          what'd she get...
	
	His eyes fall on the empty charger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Cell phone.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shit!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg raises the cell phone to her ear --
	
	-- and gets a rapid busy signal.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, no.  No, no, no no no no no...
	
	She looks at the phone.  It's showing just one signal bar,
	and even that one is flashing on and off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh come on, come on, come on...
	
	She walks around the room, raises the phone high and low,
	trying crazily to find a signal.
	
	But can't.   
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham stands just outside the door,
	fingertips lightly resting on it, the ghost of a smile on his
	face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (softly)
	          I don't think we'll be talking on
	          our cell phone from in there...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Inside the room, Meg doesn't seem upset.  Rather, she's
	staring at the cell phone in her hand, thinking.  Remembering
	something.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wires...
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	At the same moment, Burnham is having the same thought.  He's
	still at the door, fingertips still resting there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Phone...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          ... wires.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham looks down, at the baseboard below.  What is he
	looking at?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps up, onto the shelf she climbed earlier, and comes
	up next to the vent.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What are you doing?
	
	                     MEG
	          I saw something, I saw...
	
	In the vent, alongside the duct, she sees the bundle of
	multicolored wires she saw earlier.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... phone wires!
	
	She jumps down off the shelf, goes to the tools, starts
	searching for something.
	
	                     MEG
	          I may not have hooked up the phone
	          in here, but I hooked up the main
	          line, and there's a jack at the base
	          of this wall outside, I saw it!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Yes, that is correct, there is in fact a jack in the base of
	the wall outside the door to the panic room.
	
	Burnham bends down into frame, studying it, thinking the same
	thing she is.  He clears his throat.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Say, while we're on the subject of
	          phones...
	
	He turns, looks up at Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When I said cut the line, did you
	          cut the main line at the junction
	          box in the basement like I said, and
	          which I repeated, or did you just
	          cut the cord on the phone in the
	          kitchen?
	
	Pause.  Swallow.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I, uh, I...
	
	Shit.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          ... hit a little snag finding the
	          one in the basement.
	
	Shit.
	
	Pause.  Then, as if a starting gun has been fired, Burnham
	leaps to his feet and races out of the bedroom.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	That same starting gun has been fired in the panic room.
	With a strong RIP, Meg pulls the whole bundle of multi
	colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with
	it.  She trusts it at Sarah, finds a wire cutter in the
	assorted tools, and gives her that too.
	
	                     MEG
	          Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue
	          first, blue is phones!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Blue is phones?
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
	
	While Sarah goes to work on the wires, Meg turns to the phone
	itself, the one with the buried phone line that isn't working
	yet.  She rips the phone out of its housing, tears free the
	wire on the end of it.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs from the third floor, races
	across the foyer, flies down the stairs to the kitchen floor.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races across the kitchen floor, whips open a door and
	heads down another, narrow, darkened stairway.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are like animals, clawing and tearing at the
	ends of their respective phone cables, foregoing tools and
	stripping the wires with fingers and teeth, it's faster.
	
	With the phone receiver cradled on her shoulder, Meg starts
	twisting the ends of wires onto the exposed ends of the wires
	from the phone unit.  First wire -- nothing.  She tries a
	second wire.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SLAMS open the door to a dark room, pulls the string
	on a bare bulb.  Burned out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God damn it!
	
	Without light, he can't see a thing.  He SMACKS the bulb, it
	swings wildly, SMASHES on the cement wall.  He turns and
	races out of the room.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries another wire.  Still no dial tone.  Sarah shoves
	another wire at her.  She tries again.  Nothing.  She moves
	on.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham slides to his knees, snatches a flashlight from his
	duffel, leaps up and takes off again.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Another wire.  Nothing.  Another wire.  DIAL TONE!
	
	Meg SHRIEKS and punches 911.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs, flashlight beam bouncing
	crazily in front of him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The phone is ringing.  An operator picks up.
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          911 emergency --
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm at 26 West --
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          -- please hold.
	
	It's a mechanical voice, which gives over to MUZAK.
	
	                     MEG
	          NO!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham BANGS through the door again, starts searching the
	darkened mechanical room, shining harsh light around its
	dingy walls.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	MUZAK continues to play.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	No more time to hold.  Meg hangs up the phone, dials another
	number, a seven digit one she knows by heart.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Call Dad!
	
	                     MEG
	          On it!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the mechanical room, the bouncing flashlight beam falls on
	a metal cabinet across the way.  Burnham runs to it, flings
	it open.  Circuit breakers.  SLAMS it shut.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg listens as a phone rings on the other end.  And rings.
	And rings again.
	
	This is torture.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns, sees another, smaller metal box, this one
	clearly labeled:
	
	PHONES
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the other end of the phone, a husky MALE VOICE answers;
	clearly he's been awakened.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Hello?
	
	                     MEG
	          Listen to me!  There are three --
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With a subhuman ROAR of anger, Burnham rips the entire phone
	panel off the wall with his bare hands.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With an abrupt SHRIEK, the line goes dead.  Meg pauses, can't
	believe it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hello?  Don't... are...
	
	She looks up, see Sarah looking at her, her eyebrows arches,
	her face all hope.  Meg keeps her cool, but it take a hell of
	an effort.
	
	Sarah reads her face.  She turns away.
	
	She hangs up the phone.
	
	Sarah goes to a corner of the room, faces away from her.
	
	Meg doesn't know what to say.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll do something.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Uh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll know we're in trouble.  He
	          heard me, I said "There are
	          three..."
	
	                     SARAH
	          He won't even know who it was.
	
	                     MEG
	          What would you think, in the middle
	          of the night?  I mean, three what,
	          three bears?  He'll call the police.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Stop it.
	
	                     MEG
	          He's just across the park, this is
	          why we got places so close to each
	          other, in case we needed each other,
	          we're still a family, he'll help
	          us...
	
	                     SARAH
	          He --
	
	                     MEG
	          He WILL.
	
	She practically shouted.  Sarah drop her head into her arms.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     MEG
	          Why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I was trying not to tell you...
	
	                     MEG
	          What?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy and thirsty.
	
	Meg blanches.  This is very bad news.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Tired, Burnham drags himself back up the stairs and into the
	doorway of the master bedroom.  Raoul and Junior stand there,
	staring at him.
	
	Long pause.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She's never coming out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And we're never getting in.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Do me a favor and don't talk.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Jesus, what was I thinking?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg has torn open one of the water packets and is trying to
	get Sarah to drink, but the little girl has gone completely
	pale and seems to have lost some of the strength in her neck,
	she's having trouble holding her head up.  Most of the water
	runs down her chin.
	
	                     MEG
	          Come on, come on... stay with me...
	          you gotta drink...
	
	She takes Sarah's hand, checks her wristwatch thing.  The
	readout is now
	
	82
	
	She swallows.  She grabs Sarah by the face.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, listen, honey, you went double
	          digit here, you must have been
	          shooting out adrenaline like crazy,
	          we gotta bring your blood sugar back
	          up, okay?  Can you hear me?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy, not deaf.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, she's still a smart ass,
	          excellent sign.  Did you see any
	          sugar in here?  Any candy bars,
	          anything sweet?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, you just gotta calm yourself
	          down, that's all, just stay calm and
	          your adrenaline will go back to
	          normal and you'll be fine.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I keep dropping?
	
	                     MEG
	          Not an option.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I do?
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Junior has had enough.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're leaving.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The hell we are.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, after all we went through I
	          am not walking out when we're this
	          close.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Close?  Are you insane?  We're
	          nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll
	          make an anonymous phone call on
	          Monday, they'll find the floor safe,
	          and I'll inherit the shit.  Little
	          piece of it, anyway, it's better
	          than nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?
	
	Junior thinks, then pulls out his wallet.  He thrusts a
	fistful of bills at them.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Here.  For your time.
	
	They both just stare at him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Five hundred bucks here.
	
	Neither one of them moves to take it.  Junior shurgs, drops
	it on the floor.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Suit yourself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Observe.
	
	He heads for the door, expecting Raoul to block him, but as
	he draws close --
	
	-- Raoul just steps out of the way.  Junior passes through
	and heads for the stairs.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're not leaving.  I'm getting in
	          that room, and I'm opening that
	          safe.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but
	          ten out of ten for attitude.
	
	And he disappears, down the stairs, Burnham still pleading
	with him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rifles the foodstuffs that are stored in the room.
	Sarah, in the corner, is starting to tremble.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I spazz out?
	
	                     MEG
	               (forced calm)
	          No biggie, we've been through it a
	          dozen times, I just jab you with the
	          Glucogen.
	
	Pause.  She keeps looking.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Where is the Glucogen?
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the
	          little fridge in your room.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (pause)
	          I'm sorry, Mom.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, quit apologizing, you're
	          starting to sound like Grandma.
	          You're not gonna have an attack.
	          Okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Okay.   
	
	She lays back, oddly passive, her lips changing color.  She
	stares at the monitors.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior strides into the living room, purposefully.  He tosses
	some tools into his duffel bag and heads for the stairs down
	to the kitchen.  Burnham is behind him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Would you wait?  Would you please
	          just wait a minute?
	
	But Junior heads down.  Burnham follows.  Raoul is just
	coming down from upstairs.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Junior reaches the door of the kitchen, tries to open it,
	realizes it's screwed shut.  He takes out a screwdriver and
	starts unscrewing the screws.  Burnham stops at the stairway.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You walk out that door and you lose
	          your share of the money.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yeah, whatever.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I mean it!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Adios.
	
	He gets the last screw out, throws open the door, and BLAST
	of wind gusts in, it's a blustery night out there, he takes a
	step into the doorway --
	
	-- and with a quiet PFFFT from right behind Burnham, a bullet
	whizzes across the kitchen and hits Junior in the back of the
	head.  He crumples, right in the open kitchen doorway.
	
	Burnham SHOUTS incoherently and turns.  Raoul is standing
	there, two steps up, a silencer twisted onto the barrel of
	his gun.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah is staring at the video monitors, eyes wide.  She
	raises one trembling finger, points at the kitchen monitor,
	tries to mouth the words, can't.
	
	Meg looks up.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is freaking out, but trying to stay calm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh God... oh, my God...
	
	Raoul walks past him calmly, grabs Junior by the ankles, and
	drags him back into the house.  He turns, looks at Burnham,
	whose jaw is dropped in horror.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You should see the look on your
	          face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The fuck did you do that for?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me.
	          Drives his German car up to 125th
	          Street a couple of times, buys a few
	          rounds, thinks he's a tough guy,
	          thinks he knows me.
	               (to the corpse)
	          You don't know one thing about me!
	
	While Burnham stares down at the body in shock and Raoul
	stares at Burnham, his back to the outside, a small, thin
	VOICE comes from the still-open doorway.
	
	                     VOICE
	          What the h --
	
	They turn.  A man, fiftyish, stands there in hastily thrown
	on clothes, staring down at the dead body in mute shock.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, watching the monitors with Sarah, GASPS as she sees the
	man, whose name is HARRIS.  While she and Sarah watch --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- they see the silent image of Harris, set upon by Raoul,
	who grabs him roughly and drags him inside.  Burnham hurries
	to the door --
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	-- and SLAMS it shut.  He puts his back to it, thinking,
	terrified, things are spinning out of control, fast.
	
	Raoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some
	more of his rage on Harris, whom he has hurled to the floor.
	He lands a solid boot in the side of Harris's head, leaving
	him GROANING in pain, completely disoriented.
	
	Harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming
	from underneath Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Stop it!  Stop it!
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (turning on him)
	          Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's
	          the fucking clown now?!
	
	He pulls his gun, shoves it into Burnham's eye, hard, we can
	hear the faint SIZZLE of skin burning.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Me.  I am.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's right.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I have the gun.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yes.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Remember that.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Please...
	
	Raoul pulls the gun back, just an inch.  The skin around
	Burnham's eye is an angry red.  His eyes dart, strain to look
	over at Harris, MOANING on the floor.  And at Junior, dead.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What?  What do you want me to do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What do you think?  Get us into that
	          room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't.
	
	Raoul pushes the gun barrel back into Burnham's eye socket.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You can.  You're full of ideas.  You
	          just need to squeeze one out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got till the count of three.
	          Then you end up like him.
	
	He tilts his head over to Junior, whose brains are spreading
	out on the kitchen floor.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          One.  Squeeze.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is ridiculous...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Two.  Squeeze harder.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't just...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Th --
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, okay!  Okay.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got an idea?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta
	          check something.
	
	Raoul GRUNTS, satisfied.  Pulls the gun back.  Burnham slides
	away, shaking.  He bends down, to the floor.  He looks at
	Harris's left hand.  At his index finger.
	
	He sees a white strip of skin, where Harris wore his wedding
	ring, until recently.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris, still semi-conscious, is hurled against the metal
	door of the panic room.  He collapses at its base.  Burnham,
	bends down next to him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, look.  I know you can hear me.
	          Your wife and kid are in there.
	          You're gonna get 'em to come out.
	          Or --
	
	He looks up at Raoul, hulking overhead, gun in hand.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Or I can't stop what he's gonna do.
	          Do you understand?
	
	Harris, regaining some semblance of consciousness, nods
	feebly.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Good.
	
	Burnham stands up, turns to the video camera, and SHOUTS.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah and Meg see the horrifying sight on the video monitors.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at the door to the room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN UP!
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	they see Burnham, standing over Harris; they faintly hear him
	call to them to open the door.
	
	And then they hear another VOICE, calling back to them.
	Sarah sits up, recognizes her father's voice.
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          DADDY!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris is SHOUTING against the closed door.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          DON'T DO IT!  NO MATTER WHAT
	          HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!
	          DON'T O --
	
	He's silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs.  Raoul begins to
	beat him.
	
	Burnham stands by, powerless, horrifies, watching as Raoul
	savages Harris, who continues to call out, as long as he has
	strength, telling Meg not to open the door, no matter what.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah SHOUT in horror, she covers her daughter's
	face, turn her away from the screen, SCREAMS in incoherent
	anger of her own.
	
	But she doesn't open the door.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at Raoul, pleading.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS
	          KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING
	          THIS!!
	
	But Raoul whips the gun up, into Burnham's throat, backing
	him off, shutting him up.
	
	He resumes his pounding of Harris.
	
	Burnham turns, looks up at the camera in the corner of the
	room.
	
	He can't stand it anymore.  He whips off his jacket, runs to
	the camera, and covers the lens.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	While Meg watches, the monitor that cover the master bedroom
	abruptly goes black, mercifully sparing them the sight of
	Harris's beating.
	
	She holds Sarah, who's sobbing, shaking.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris finally lapses into unconsciousness.  Raoul stands
	over him, chest heaving.
	
	Burnham stand in the doorway, neither in nor out of the room,
	a silhouette, head hung.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries desperately to see something on the bedroom
	monitor, but it's hopeless, it's covered.  On the hallway
	monitor, she can just see shadows, as two men in the bedroom
	lift a third off the floor and carry him across the room.
	
	A sudden BEEPING sound tears her attention away.  Still
	holding Sarah, she pulls her back, off her shoulder.  Her
	face is completely white, her lips blue, her eyes rolled back
	into her head.  The BEEPING sound grows louder, she checks
	Sarah's wristwatch, the reading is dire:
	
	57
	
	Meg GASPS, horrifies.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh God, oh my God...
	
	Sarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of Meg's arms
	and falls back onto the floor of the panic room.  Meg clears
	everything away from her, tries to make room for her.
	
	The convulsion worsens.  Meg searches through the piles of
	supplies, comes up with a plastic-handled screwdriver.  She
	opens Sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her
	teeth.
	
	She helps Sarah ride out the convulsion.  Finally, her eyes
	roll back into her head, she slowly re-orients herself.
	Sarah reaches over, turns off her still-BEEPING
	wristwatch/monitor herself.
	
	Sarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere
	near normal.
	
	Her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow
	yellow color.  She moves her lips, Meg can't hear her, she
	bends down:
	
	                     SARAH
	          You gotta jab me, Mommy...
	
	Meg turns, looks back at the monitors.  What she sees is good
	news --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera.  Burnham
	and Raoul are gone, the only person there is HARRIS, who lies
	slumped on the far side of the bed.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room.
	
	ON THAT MONITOR,
	
	she sees Burnham and Raoul having an urgent conversation,
	Burnham sitting in a chair, Raoul pacing in front of him,
	ranting.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so
	overjoyed at this turn of events.
	
	She turns, looks back at Sarah, who is starting to tremble
	again.
	
	That does it.  Meg leaps up, hits the button that controls
	the steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost
	impossibly slowly.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps out of the panic room, into the master bedroom.
	She looks at Harris, on the bed.  With his back to her she
	can't even tell if he's alive or dead, but first things must
	be first, so she turns and races out of the room.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg flies up the stairs, bare feet on padded carpet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Raoul looks up, hearing the pitter-pat of
	her feet on the stairs above.
	
	He smiles and pulls his ski mask back on, to cover his face.
	
	Coming around behind him, we see Burnham sitting in the
	chair.  Except it isn't Burnham at all, it's Harris,
	unconscious, wearing Burnham's shirt.
	
	And if Harris is the person in the chair, that means --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the person on the bed in the bedroom is Burnham, wearing
	Harris's shirt.  His eyes pop open, he sits up, sees the wide
	open door to the panic room.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's bedroom and tears open the door of a
	mini-fridge.  Inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin
	and something called Glucogen.
	
	She grabs a bottle of Glucogen and a black leather pouch and
	takes off.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	As Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying
	sight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the
	doorway of the master bedroom.
	
	She SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,
	reaches the end, throws the door open --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is
	motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can
	already see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open
	doorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim
	"tricked you" expression.
	
	Meg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She
	claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask,
	tears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her
	from pulling it off --
	
	-- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor --
	
	-- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away
	from them.
	
	Raoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the
	floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his
	face.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster,
	she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood
	toward it.
	
	Raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints
	for the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the
	medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room,
	where Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
	controls the steel door.
	
	She makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic
	bottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the
	gap just before --
	
	-- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous
	ferocity.
	
	And then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the
	door.
	
	She stands back, chest heaving, sobbing.
	
	A looooong moment goes by.
	
	Finally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	               (calmly)
	          If you leave the house, we'll kill
	          her.
	
	Meg sobs.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          If I see a uniform in the house,
	          we'll kill her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh... oh...
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You understand?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom.  She nods,
	terrified.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham pushes past Raoul, at the speaker button, and leans
	forward.  He's approaching exhaustion.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (into speaker)
	          I just... I just need forty-five
	          minutes.
	
	Raoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera,
	SCREAMING something up at it, the same thing, over and over.
	But in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through
	the walls isn't enough to be heard.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Shut up.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we abruptly hear her voice, full-throated.
	
	                     MEG
	               (shouting into the camera)
	          -- cine, she needs the MEDICINE!
	          GIVE HER THE --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest,
	staring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking
	very, very sick.
	
	Burnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can
	come up with under the circumstances.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta
	          here before you know it.
	
	No response from Sarah.  Burnham cocks a head, really looking
	at her.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
	
	Burnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in
	the middle of the floor.  Over his shoulder, we can see the
	face of Meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera,
	begging them to give Sarah her medicine.
	
	Using his hand, Burnham measures six lengths in from the
	wall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet,
	looking for a seam.
	
	He finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other
	hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to
	turn a corner.  He stands, hovering over the carpet, and
	pulls back evenly with both hands.
	
	The concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft
	sound of tearing VELCRO.  Underneath the flap --
	
	-- is the smooth metal door of a floor safe.
	
	Burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove.  It rolls
	out and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of
	safecracking tools.
	
	He begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a
	POUNDING on the metal door.  He turns, annoyed.  Meg is still
	SCREAMING outside the door.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The hell does she want?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't know, she keeps screamin'
	          the same thing over and over.
	
	Burnham turns, looks at the monitors.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving
	herself an injection in the arm.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul laughs.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the
	          fuck?
	
	But Burnham thinks.  His eyes fall on the bottle and the
	leather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to
	Sarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor.  Her
	lips are moving.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, man...
	
	He crawls over to Sarah, puts his ear down next to Sarah's
	lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What is it?
	
	Sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak, but her
	breath comes hard.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I need...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah?
	
	                     SARAH
	          ... 'jection...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          An injection?
	
	Sarah nods.  Burnham points to the pouch and the Glucogen, on
	the floor nearby.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That stuff?
	
	Sarah nods again.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can you do it yourself?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Well, I don't know how.
	
	Sarah looks at him, eyes pleading.  Raoul stands behind
	Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't fucking believe this.
	               (to Sarah)
	          You gotta wait.
	
	Sarah just looks at Burnham.  Please.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a
	          little more, and your mom'll give it
	          to you.  You can wait a half hour,
	          can't you?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's
	          just like, tired, she's gotta rest.
	          You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
	
	Sarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Come on.
	
	He starts to pull Burnham away, but Burnham shakes his hand
	off, violently.  He bends down very close to Sarah's lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me the truth, okay?  What's
	          gonna happen if you don't get this?
	
	Sarah swallows, licks her cracking lips.  When she speaks,
	it's breathy, almost inaudible.
	
	But the words are clear.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Coma.  Die.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Seen from overhead, Meg paces in the master bedroom, out of
	her mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people
	in the room the desperate situation.
	
	Suddenly, a VOICE comes over the intercom speaker.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          I understand.  I'll give her the
	          shot.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	A HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and
	the leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.
	Raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're wasting your fucking time,
	          man, you're wasting my time.  You
	          don't know how to do this, and the
	          longer we stay in here, the more
	          likely she's gonna lose it and call
	          the cops!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you gonna open the safe?
	
	Raoul looks at him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Then shut up and get out of my way.
	
	As Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with
	Sarah, who is staring at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't look at me.
	
	ACROSS THE ROOM,
	
	Burnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the
	pouch.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, kid, all I know about this is
	          what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk
	          me through it.
	
	Sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham
	swallows.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV
	          don't lie, right?
	
	He reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,
	and a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,
	stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You seem like a good kid.  Your
	          mom... only saw her for a second,
	          but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?
	
	No answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's
	arm, pulls it tight.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey, nod or something, show me
	          you're still alive, will ya?
	
	Sarah nods.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Attagirl.  That too tight?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts
	to fill it from the Glucogen bottle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You guys are pretty rich, huh?
	
	Sarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of
	finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he
	goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, you don't think about that
	          stuff.  Good for you.
	
	He looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about
	him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know, I know.  I really screwed
	          the pooch this time.  I never did
	          anything like this before.  Break
	          into somebody's house?  Not even
	          close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to
	          God, I been on the wrong end of
	          maybe six straight years of bad
	          cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.
	               (snaps his fingers --
	                gone)
	          Those are some seriously bad cards.
	          And still, every time I pick up a
	          fresh hand I swear to God, the rush
	          comes so hot and prickly I feel it
	          right down to my toes because this
	          time, this one time, it might be
	          there, this time it might be that
	          hand, that perfect hand, that
	          monster hand.
	               (shakes his head)
	          And you thought you were sick.
	
	The shot successfully given, he pulls Sarah's sleeve back
	down.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Feel better?
	
	Sarah nods, and she seems better already.  Burnham helps her
	to sit up, to lean against the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Woulda been a hell of a dad.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	A VOICE comes over the intercom in the master bedroom.  It's
	Raoul.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          She's okay.  Now sit down and wait.
	
	He CLICKS off.
	
	Meg is hugely relieved.  And extremely pissed off.  She goes
	to the corner of the room and picks up the gun, the one that
	Raoul dropped.
	
	She heads downstairs.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sparks fly as Burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a
	small, specialized drill.
	
	Raoul bends down next to him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Congratulations.  You saved her life
	          for ten minutes.
	
	Burnham looks up at him -- what?  But Raoul turns and walks
	away.
	
	Burnham goes back to work.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is in the living room, with Harris, who is still slouched
	in the chair.  He's in awful shape, barely conscious.
	
	Out of the silence, a sudden, deafening sound.
	
	The DOORBELL.
	
	Her eyes go wide.  She darts a look over to the door (the one
	that leads to the stoop, not the bloody kitchen door
	downstairs), then back at Harris.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          Police.
	
	                     MEG
	               (gasps)
	          You called the police?
	
	He nods.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          You... scared...
	
	Shit.  This is exactly what she prayed for him to do, now
	it's the worst thing that could happen.
	
	She stands, thinking, desperate.  She walks toward the door,
	stops, thinks some more.
	
	The doorbell RINGS again.
	
	She comes up with a plan.  She goes back to where Harris is
	in the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of
	the door.  She puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it
	to steady it.
	
	She leans down, WHISPERS to him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.  Say.  A word.
	
	He nods.
	
	Meg takes a breath, walks across the foyer, tousling her hair
	as she goes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul is staring at the monitors, aghast.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Holy shit... holy shit...
	
	Burnham races over, looks over his shoulder.  One monitor
	covers the front stoop, and on that monitor they can clearly
	see TWO UNIFORMED COPS.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the
	          kid!  She just killed her own kid!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's not her fault, it's not her
	          fault, the guy must have called
	          them.  Look, look, look, she's
	          telling us.
	
	He points to another monitor, the one in the foyer, where Meg
	is looking up at the camera, miming to them -- don't worry,
	I'll take care of this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's gonna handle it.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She better.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg's shaking hand rises up to the doorknob and pulls open
	the big front door.  On the stoop, the two Cops turn to look
	at her.  She acts as if she's just been awakened.  She looks
	it, too, still in T-shirt and boxer shorts.  The wind is
	gusty and cold outside.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Everything okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you all right?
	
	                     MEG
	          What are you guys -- what time is
	          it?
	
	                     COP 1
	          'Bout four o'clock.
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't get it.
	
	                     COP 2
	          We got a call...
	
	Cop 1 looks at him.  Cop 2 stops talking.
	
	                     MEG
	          Somebody called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          What do you want?
	
	                     COP 1
	          We'd like to come in.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, you can't come in.
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm fine.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who
	          called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          You don't look so good.
	
	                     MEG
	          You wake me out of a sound sleep at
	          four in the morning and then tell me
	          I look like hell?  Of course I look
	          like hell, you don't look so hot
	          yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here,
	          thank you for checking, can I go?
	
	Cop 1 studies her, notices the burned sleeve of her T-shirt,
	the black smudges still on her face.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Your husband says you said "There
	          are three..." right before you got
	          cut off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, that phone call...
	
	Cop 1 takes a step forward and lowers his voice to just above
	a whisper, unconsciously making her lean forward in order to
	hear him.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Ma'am, if there's something you want
	          to say to us right now that maybe
	          you can't say to us right now, maybe
	          you just want to make a signal, by
	          blinking a few times, something like
	          that.
	
	She just looks at him.  Wow, this guy's intuitive.  She is
	sorely tempted.  But she can't.
	
	                     COP 1
	          That's something you could do.
	          Safely.
	
	She thinks, thinks --
	
	-- and burst out laughing.
	
	                     MEG
	          Man, you are good!  You mean, like,
	          if somebody was in the house or
	          something?  That's great, they
	          really train you guys these days,
	          don't they?
	
	Cop 1 looks at her, not sure if he believes her or not.
	
	                     MEG
	          No.  I'm fine.  Cross my heart.
	
	Cop 2 turns to go, but Cop 1 lingers.
	
	                     COP 1
	          May I ask what the rest of that
	          sentence was going to be?
	
	                     MEG
	               (stalling)
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 1
	          The sentence that started "There are
	          three."  What was the rest?
	
	Pause.  She stares at him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, look.  My husband and I just
	          broke up.  It's my first night in
	          the new house, and I was feeling a
	          little lonely and a little drunk.
	          The sentence, if you insist on
	          knowing, was going to be "There are
	          three things I'll do for you if you
	          come over right now and get in bed
	          with me."
	
	Cop 2 stifles a laugh.
	
	                     MEG
	          But thank God I came to my senses
	          before I said all that and hung up
	          instead, so nobody would ever know
	          what I was thinking, unless, of
	          course, two policemen showed up in
	          the middle of the night to
	          interrogate me about it.
	
	That was good.  Cop 1 is embarrassed.  Cop 2 thinks it's
	funny.
	
	                     COP 2
	          You want her to show you which three
	          things, Rick, or should we just go?
	
	Cop 1 looks at Meg, a long look, he holds it for one last
	moment, trying to read her mind.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the video image of the Cops as they turn and head away
	down the front steps.  Meg closes the doors, looks up into a
	camera, right at us.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham and Raoul breathe a sigh of relief.
	
	Burnham goes back to work on the safe.  He's making progress.
	
	Raoul looks at Sarah.  Stares actually.  He's thinking too.
	
	Bad thoughts.  He moves over, crouches down next to Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She saw my face.  The kid too.
	
	Sarah overhears that.  She raises her head, alarmed.  Burnham
	turns, looks over at her, and she just gets her head back
	down in time.  Burnham and Raoul close themselves off, for a
	private conversation.
	
	Sarah edges closer.  She overhears a fragment.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's your problem.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's their problem.
	
	Sarah is terrified.  Doesn't know what to do.  She looks to
	her immediate left, sees the intercom panel.  She edges
	closer.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Let me fucking finish this so we can
	          get out of here.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You finish.  Then we finish.
	
	Sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button -- "ALL PAGE."
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, there is an audible CLICK as the speaker
	is activated.  Meg looks up, hears Burnham's voice, in the
	middle of a sentence.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          -- posed to mean?
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You're here with me, you're already
	          on the hook for one.  Buy one, you
	          get the rest for the same price.
	          You know that.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          Get the fuck away from me.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          The kid in here.  The other two when
	          we come out.
	
	Meg listens, horrified.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah holds the intercom button down with a trembling finger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Bullshit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You know how this gotta end.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stares, in shock, as Raoul's voice echoes in the empty
	room.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          They stay in the house.
	
	There in an abrupt CLICK, and the speaker turns off.  Meg
	turns, goes to Harris, falls to her knees, no idea what to
	do.  She holds him close, their foreheads touching.  She's
	terrified, exhausted, wants to collapse in his arms.
	
	Instead, she starts to pull the gun from his fingers.  He
	tightens his grip, what are you doing?  He tries to hold onto
	the gun, but she pulls his fingers off it, takes it away from
	him.  He is too weak to resist.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Sarah has her hands clamped over her ears,
	her mouth is wide open, and a hideous METAL SHRIEK seems to
	be coming out of it.
	
	But the SHRIEK is actually coming from the safe, where
	Burnham continues to work, another drill, a bigger bit.  The
	noise is deafening.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Sarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom,
	carrying a jacket.  Meg tosses the jacket, this time she
	doesn't want them to see what she's doing.
	
	The monitor goes black.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are
	hanging over a chair.
	
	She steps into a pair of boots.
	
	She shoves the gun into her belt.
	
	Here in the bedroom, she can hear the drill.  From the house
	next door, she hears POUNDING again, more MUFFLED CURSES.
	Apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too.
	
	Meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the
	panic room.  Her eyes light up with an idea.
	
	She goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her
	back against the exterior wall (street side), with her left
	shoulder against the common wall that's shared with the
	neighbor's brownstone.
	
	She begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring
	with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the
	entrance to the panic room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Fourteen.
	
	She hurries out of the bedroom.  What's she doing?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a
	library.  There is a window that looks out over the sidewalk,
	one floor up, same level as the stoop.
	
	She looks up, into the corners of the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          No camera, no camera, no camera...
	
	They're bare, no video cameras.  Good.
	
	She goes to the window, tries to open it.  Screwed shut, of
	course.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The safe is almost cracked.  Raoul is watching the monitors
	carefully.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living
	room, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul furrows his brow.  Now what?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.
	She gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.
	
	The wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.
	
	She leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is
	empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the
	house).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's
	front stoop.
	
	She tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up
	onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.
	
	We lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops
	down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --
	
	-- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly
	standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was
	specifically told not to go.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to
	be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to
	turn around, to look at the monitors again --
	
	-- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hey!
	
	He turns, away from the monitors.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.
	
	Raoul scowls at her.  Behind him --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on
	the monitor.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees her mother go.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (to Raoul)
	          Won't happen again.
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Still leaning out the window, we can see Meg from here as she
	reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the
	neighbor's house, which is contiguous.
	
	Straining to see (yet stay in the house), we see Meg all the
	way at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to
	the back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door,
	sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg.
	
	After a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open.
	The conversation begins.  The wind is gusting right in our
	faces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear --
	let me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions.
	
	The NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like
	an old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy.
	
	Losing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way
	and shoves into the house.  The Neighbor stumbles out onto
	her front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a
	nightgown, but she's no shrinking violet.  In fact, she's
	royally pissed off and not at all intimidated.
	
	                     NEIGHBOR
	          What the hell do you think you're
	          doing, young lady?!
	
	She storms back into her house, following Meg.  As both of
	them disappear from the frame, we move out of the library,
	into the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one
	shared with the neighbor's brownstone.
	
	From the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices,
	arguing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other.
	
	We drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of
	footsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them,
	from inside this house.  We pass right through the floor --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and
	now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
	wall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's
	firm, urgent declarations.
	
	We move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what
	she's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side
	of the wall.  We drift down that wall, fourteen steps, until
	we reach the metal door to the panic room, then we pass
	through that door --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and arrive inside the panic room, where Burnham is this
	close to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden --
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	Burnham and Raoul freeze, alarmed.  It's coming from the long
	wall, the shared wall.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	They look at the wall.
	
	Somebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The walls are steel, right?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not that one.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          NOT THAT ONE?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,
	          who breaks in through the neighbor's
	          house?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	Louder.  Closer.  Burnham turns, SCREAMS at the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE
	          NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We've got the Kid!
	               (shouting at the wall)
	          WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck
	          is she thinking?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's got your gun, that's what
	          she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to
	          bring a gun for?!
	
	Burnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work
	on the safe.  Fires up the drill again, it SCREAMS into the
	metal.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Almost there...
	
	The POUNDING keeps up from next door.  We hear sheetrock torn
	away on the far side.  Bricks, SCRAPING out of place.
	
	Sarah, in the corner, is energized, excited.  While Burnham
	and Raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms
	the three syringes that are left in there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          ALMOST THERE...
	
	Finally, the door to the safe CRUNCHES in on one side,
	yielding to the drilling --
	
	-- at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer CRASHES
	through the wall of the panic room.  Raoul grabs hold of
	Sarah, Burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe,
	revealing --
	
	-- nothing.
	
	CRUNCH!
	
	The sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about
	a foot across.  Light spills through from the other side, as
	well as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.
	
	Raoul hurls Sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the
	side of the hole, and waits, poised above it.
	
	At the safe, Burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a
	false bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope.
	
	He snatches it up, RIPS it open, and his eyes dance as he
	holds up fourteen individual one million dollar U,S, Treasury
	Bearer Bonds.  He fans them out, eyes drinking from his
	Grail.
	
	BANG!
	
	A gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it
	aflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little
	cloud of plaster dust.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          JESUS!
	
	He whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall,
	gun extended.
	
	But Raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has
	his boot raised, over the hand.  He brings it down, a
	CRUNCHING blow that stomps right on Meg's wrist.
	
	Meg SCREAMS, loses her grip on the gun, and it CLATTERS into
	the space between the houses.
	
	BETWEEN THE WALLS,
	
	the gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls,
	where no one can get to it.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!
	
	Raoul grabs Sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open
	the door.
	
	Behind them, Meg SCREAMS in anger and wriggles through the
	opening.  Before she's even all the way through, she gets
	hold of Raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room,
	scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too-small
	hole.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!
	
	But Raoul is deep in a violent rage.  Still holding Sarah
	with one hand, he bends down, grabs Meg by the hair, and
	drags her toward the doorway.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
	
	He bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is
	just finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling
	in the wall.
	
	Raoul drag Meg across the floor by the hair, right into the
	track of the open steel door.
	
	She looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head,
	and  realizes with horror what his intention is.
	
	Still with one arm holding Sarah, who is kicking and
	struggling viciously, Raoul holds Meg's head down on the
	floor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
	closing.  He reaches for the "close" button.
	
	Sarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs
	them into Raoul's neck.  Raoul SCREAMS in pain.
	
	Meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	On the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching
	with indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above
	him.
	
	He runs down three steps.
	
	Stops again.
	
	Runs down the rest of the stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door,
	but he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam
	with one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the
	same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.
	
	Finally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.
	
	Looking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.
	
	Raoul jabs the button --
	
	-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one
	at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is
	broken, the door will not close.
	
	Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah
	flying across the room.
	
	Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the
	beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over
	again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then
	breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.
	
	But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it
	up, her head trembles --
	
	-- and collapses onto the floor.
	
	The beam completes --
	
	-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --
	
	-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He
	reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but
	Raoul loses his balance, falls forward --
	
	-- into the gap --
	
	-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door
	that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.
	
	Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on
	tight.
	
	The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.
	Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.
	
	Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.
	
	They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face
	contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.
	
	She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.
	
	He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,
	throws it open --
	
	-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He
	blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that
	gun.
	
	It's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and
	was so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood
	smeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to
	know his suspicions were correct.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Put your hands up.
	
	Burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves
	blow into the house, a real gale outside.
	
	From behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a
	half dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in
	the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the
	ROARING wind.
	
	Burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the
	Cop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but
	doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS
	CRACK through the door behind him.
	
	Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
	door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks
	of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his
	chest, a triangle pattern.
	
	Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his
	jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.
	
	He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like
	playing cards.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Monster hand.
	
	Behind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS
	appear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the
	bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of
	poker.
	
	He GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,
	twisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the
	foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the
	bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,
	as if they were never meant to leave.
	
	Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the
	ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,
	suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over
	his head as he dies.
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
	air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float
	down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
	saw in Meg's hallucination.
	
	But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
	throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
	nothing.
	
	The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
	out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
	to the ads.
	
	Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
	at the clouds.
	
	Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I mean, uptown is close to Dad's
	          place, but somebody at school said
	          the Village is really cool, so... I
	          don't know, it's so great to be
	          close to the park and everything...
	          What do you think, I mean, give me a
	          clue, here, where are we gonna live?
	
	Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems
	years younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
	daughter's hair behind one ear.
	
	She smiles.  She is calm.
	
	Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
	clear autumn sky.
	
	                                                FADE OUT.

	                     This film is short.
	
	                     This film is fast.
	
	
	
	FADE IN:
	
	EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY
	
	The whole island, from the south.  For a second.  Literally.
	
	EXT.  NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY
	
	Closer, just the skyline.  For another second.
	
	EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY
	
	Closer still, the Upper West Side.  For another second.  No
	time to waste admiring the scenery.
	
	EXT.  WEST 83RD STREET - DAY
	
	Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women
	hurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate
	broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a
	stride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with
	her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine
	year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a
	basketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher
	than Meg, who she resembles.
	
	Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          -- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five
	          feet deep, forty-two hundred square
	          feet, four floors with a rentable
	          basement apartment, so five
	          altogether, courtyard in back --
	
	                     MEG
	          Could you slow down a little?
	               (looking back over her
	                shoulder)
	          Or we could wait for the car...
	
	                     LYDIA
	          No cars.  Feet are faster.
	
	                     MEG
	          How many more do we have after this?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          None, there's nothing else, you know
	          how tight the market is.
	
	                     MEG
	          This is it?  I told you on the
	          phone, I have to be moved in in two
	          weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce
	          that here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom, it's the sidewalk.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, that miserable little prick is
	          already leaving.
	
	They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
	townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
	more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
	door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them
	coming.
	
	                     EVAN
	          One day you will learn to respect
	          other people's time, Lydia, one day
	          you --
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Evan, I am so sorry, you were a
	          saint to wait for us!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	Evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of
	the townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks
	fast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,
	Sarah still bouncing her basketball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          This is the middle of the house, the
	          entry floor, living room's over
	          there.  The kitchen floor's below us
	          and there's two bedroom floors
	          above.
	
	The front door closes behind them, with a THUD so
	authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg
	tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop
	bouncing the ball in the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's an enormous amount of space for
	          the money and I'll be perfectly
	          honest, the family is in no hurry
	          whatsoever.
	
	Meg whispers Sarah's name, but Sarah still ignores her, goes
	on bouncing the ball.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I don't have to tell you there is an
	          acute shortage of living space in
	          Manhattan right now and this is a
	          highly unique property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          No ball, kid.
	
	Sarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the
	living room, peers through the big French doors, which look
	out over the courtyard area.  There's another row of
	brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to
	one another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.
	
	Sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the
	window.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg
	watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.
	Can't.
	
	Evan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style
	elevator.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,
	          the previous owner, was disabled the
	          last ten years of his life.  Highly
	          unusual, the elevator, you will not
	          find this in ninety percent of
	          brownstones.
	
	                     MEG
	          Will they take asking price?  I need
	          a two week escrow and I'm already
	          approved for the loan.
	
	Lydia turns, gives Meg an "are you insane?" look.
	
	                     EVAN
	          What say we see the house before we
	          dicker, hmm?
	               (starting up the stairs)
	          I have to warn you, this is exactly
	          the response we expected to get.
	          It's a very emotional property.
	
	As he disappears upstairs, Lydia turns to Meg, lowers her
	voice.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Who taught you to negotiate?
	
	                     SARAH
	          It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't
	          have to pay the price on the tag.
	
	She gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a
	bang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,
	turns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we
	notice her thin hand is shaking.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...
	          money, and... this is more my
	          husband's area.
	
	She digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some
	water.
	
	                     MEG
	          Was.  His area.  I'm not very good
	          at...
	
	Lydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for Meg to
	finish her sentence.  Not very good at what?
	
	                     MEG
	          Things, and if I can't prove to my
	          soon to-be ex-husband that I can
	          provide a suitable place for our
	          daughter to live in the next
	          fourteen days, it's going to get
	          ugly between us.  Uglier.
	
	Lydia just looks at her, no idea what to say.  These two are
	from different places.
	
	                     EVAN (O.S.)
	               (from upstairs)
	          It would be so lovely if I could
	          shot the property before I leave!
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Evan, Lydia, and Meg poke their heads in a series of rooms,
	one after the other, the tour flying by quickly.  First, an
	upstairs bedroom.  Nice, roomy, looks out on the courtyard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one
	          bathroom.
	
	INT.  DEN - DAY
	
	Another floor, another empty room.  The trio passes through.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
	          what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used
	          it as an office.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low voice, to Meg)
	          He's talking about Bernard
	          Pearlstine.
	
	Meg shrugs, who's that?
	
	                     EVAN
	               (moving, through a
	                bathroom)
	          Master bath.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          The hotel guy?  It's been in the
	          papers lately.  His kids are all
	          suing each other over his estate.
	          He was a total recluse, paranoid,
	          rich as hell, he was worth thirty
	          million or something, now it turns
	          out they can't find half of it.
	               (singsong)
	          Somebody took something didn't
	          belong to them!
	
	                     EVAN
	          I hardly see how family gossip is
	          germane to showing the property.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (low, to Meg)
	          Stop calling it the property, you
	          sound ridiculous.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (through a closet)
	          Master closet.
	
	From the hallway, there is a GROANING METALLIC sound, the
	elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
	puts it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his
	mouth hurts when he moves it.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Could the child please stop that?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
	
	She looks at Meg and winks.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	                     EVAN
	          And we emerge in the master bedroom.
	
	He checks his watch.
	
	Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She
	looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next
	door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the
	window wall.  She takes two steps back from it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Something's weird.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          What?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, doesn't that corner
	          seem funny to you?
	
	She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to
	the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the
	closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look
	closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
	toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which
	the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
	it is.
	
	                     EVAN
	          I was waiting to see if you'd
	          notice!  On caravan, no one from our
	          office had the slightest idea.
	
	He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a
	faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He
	pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty
	degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
	closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look
	closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.
	
	Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,
	twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and
	the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and
	Lydia step forward, fascinated.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY
	
	From the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we
	see the three of them standing in the open doorway,
	silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
	windows behind them.
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's called a panic room.
	
	He hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.
	
	                     MEG
	          A what?
	
	                     EVAN
	          A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A
	          castle keep, in medieval times.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Oh, I've seen these...
	
	                     EVAN
	          It's quite in vogue in high end
	          construction right now.  One really
	          can't be too careful about home
	          invasion.
	
	The other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door,
	looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
	-- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope,
	clothes, blankets -- you get the idea.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Hey, this is perfect for you...
	               (Meg scoffs)
	          Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're
	          living alone now.  Your alarm goes
	          off, or you head glass break, or for
	          whatever reason you think someone's
	          broken into your home in the middle
	          of the night.  What are you going to
	          do?  Call the police and wait until
	          they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse
	          downstairs in your sexy little
	          underthings and check it out?  I
	          think not!
	
	                     EVAN
	          Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried
	          phone line, completely separate, not
	          connected to the house's main line
	          and never exposed throughout the
	          house's infrastructure or outside
	          the house -- you can call the
	          police; nobody can cut you off.
	          Your own ventilation system,
	          complete with oxygen scrubber, so
	          you've got plenty of fresh air for
	          as long as you like.  And a bank of
	          video monitors --
	
	He hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors,
	revealing a dozen different views of the house.
	
	                     EVAN
	          -- covering almost every corner of
	          the house.
	
	Meg nods, starting to sweat.
	
	                     MEG
	          Makes me nervous.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Why?
	
	                     MEG
	          Ever read any Poe?
	
	                     LYDIA
	          I don't think so, but I love her
	          album.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, Edgar Allen.
	
	                     LYDIA
	               (thinks)
	          The furniture guy?
	
	                     MEG
	               (giving up)
	          What's to keep them from prying open
	          the door?
	
	Evan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall
	behind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door
	leaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a
	submarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place
	inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Steel, four inches thick.
	
	Meg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Everything's spring-loaded, even if
	          the power's out it's fully
	          functional.
	
	                     MEG
	          Open it.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with
	          this room, did he?
	
	                     MEG
	          Open the door.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          And with kids like he's got, no
	          wonder he wanted a place to hide.
	
	                     EVAN
	          That's highly inappropriate.
	
	                     MEG
	          I said open the door.
	
	Evan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open,
	recoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little
	girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          My room.  Definitely my room.
	
	She bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
	
	Meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining
	her composure.  Not crazy about tight spaces.  Which we
	already knew.
	
	                     LYDIA
	          That door is a safely hazard.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Not at all.
	
	He points.  There's a tiny red beam that shines across the
	doorway, one at shoulder height --
	
	                     EVAN
	          Infrared.  Like the beam in an
	          elevator doorway.  Won't let the
	          door close if something's blocking
	          it.
	
	-- and one at shin height.  Even bend down, blocks the one at
	shin height with his hand.
	
	                     EVAN
	          Watch.
	
	He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand
	anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.
	
	                     EVAN
	               (to Lydia)
	          Push that button for me, will you?
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't!
	
	Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens.  Evan pulls
	his hand put of the beam, takes a step back.  Lydia pushes
	the button again.
	
	WHANG!  The metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang
	reverberating in the room.  Almost immediately, the fake
	piece of wall HUMS shut, of its own accord, followed a moment
	later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of
	the closet door and HUMS silently back into place, closing
	over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like
	a corner again.
	
	As the mirrored door closes, it shows Meg her own reflection.
	She looks at herself, still rattled.  She wipes a trickle of
	sweat from the side of her face.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY
	
	The same house, two weeks later.  The entry floor is piled
	high with moving boxes.  Sarah and Meg lie sprawled out in
	the middle of the black and white tile, arms and legs splayed
	wide, exhausted.
	
	They stare up at the ceiling, beat.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Too many stairs.
	
	                     MEG
	          Got us in here, didn't I?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Shoulda got an apartment.
	
	                     MEG
	          Well, I know that now.
	
	                     SARAH
	          478-0150.
	
	Meg raises her hand to her face, she's got her cell phone in
	her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          Battery's dead.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - DAY
	
	Meg picks up the wall phone in the kitchen, gets a dial tone.
	
	                     MEG
	          The phone works.
	               (to Sarah)
	          Hey, I hooked up the phone.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (sarcastic)
	          The crowd goes wild.
	
	                     MEG
	               (ignoring the slight)
	          478...
	
	                     SARAH
	          0150.
	
	Meg finishes dialing.  It rings, someone answers.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Perry's Pizza, please hold.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Night has fallen.  Meg and Sarah sit at a small table in the
	middle of the kitchen, surrounded by packing boxes.  They eat
	pizza.  They chew, silently.  Sarah drinks a diet Dr.
	Pepper.  Meg finishes a glass of wine.
	
	Meg's eyes are moist.  Sarah notices.  She notices her
	noticing, shrugs.  I'm human, what do you want me to do, hide
	it?
	
	Sarah looks away, goes back to chewing.  After a moment:
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Fuck her too.
	
	Meg looks at her, not sure how to confront the open defiance.
	
	                     MEG
	          I agree.  But don't.
	
	Sarah stares at her for a moment, then goes back to eating.
	
	Meg picks up the bottle of wine.
	
	Sarah's eyes flick over and watch as wine GLUGS into her
	mother's glass.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah's bedroom is full of unpacked boxes, but her twin bed
	has been set up and Sarah is in it, hair wet, pajamas on.
	She reads from a book ("Tom Swift and His Repelatron Skyway")
	while Meg, drowsy, lies next to her, listening.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Tom's throat felt so dry and tight
	          that it was a moment before he could
	          make any sound come out.  "Dad!" He
	          croaked.  "I'm - inside - the -
	          machine!" "Great Scott!"  The elder
	          scientist gasped.  He dashed across
	          the laboratory and switched off the
	          repelatron's motor.  "What happened,
	          son?" "The Durafoam hardened, Dad.
	          Get a solvent, quick -- you know the
	          formula!"
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bathroom, Meg soaks in a bath.  She is
	exhausted.  She reaches for her wine glass, finishes the last
	of it.
	
	She stretches for the bottle, which is on the floor next to
	her.  She refills the glass.  Again.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, dressed in an old Knicks T-shirt and boxer shorts,
	stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom, reading
	from an instruction manual.  She's frustrated.  She mutters,
	slurring, a bit drunk.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... shunt,
	          enter, zone number...
	
	She tries it, pushing a few buttons, but the alarm panel
	BEEPS at her disapprovingly.  She's doing something wrong.
	
	She sighs, sits on the floor, gets serious about figuring out
	the instructions.
	
	                     MEG
	          Bypass non-ready zones... ah, shunt,
	          enter, shunt again, zone number...
	          wait...
	
	HER FINGERS
	
	dance over the alarm panel, some time later.  She seems to
	have figured it out, and a small light on the panel lights
	up.
	
	SYSTEM ARMED
	
	The very moment the red light goes on, we cut sharply to --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the darkened panic room, where the dozen small video
	screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of
	the house.  Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably
	not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on
	for the night.
	
	The door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
	hangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has
	made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must
	have been playing here before bed.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom.
	
	She fills a glass of water, puts it on a box she's using for
	a night table.
	
	She plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone, places the
	phone in the cradle.  It BEEPS.  "Charging."
	
	She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of
	water.  It's 12:26.
	
	She gets in bed, her side, the left side.
	
	She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from
	her.
	
	We drift off her, see the clock again.  The time changes, the
	number one dissolves away, changing the time to --
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the
	door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and
	down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,
	still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping
	even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the
	ground floor.
	
	We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the
	canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on
	the street.
	
	We move right up against the window, peer through the glass
	just as --
	
	-- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see
	through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the
	driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark
	clothes.
	
	The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across
	the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.
	
	He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.
	We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.
	
	But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in
	again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.
	
	The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,
	which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.
	Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.
	
	He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,
	onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't
	tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for
	something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.
	
	The fire escape.
	
	The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of
	vision.
	
	We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We
	start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in
	the kitchen, toward the stairwell.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw
	earlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through
	the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the
	way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were
	looking down.
	
	A skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move
	up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside
	the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house,
	and just as we near the skylight --
	
	-- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark
	clothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the
	skylight, looking at us without seeing us again.
	
	He steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends
	to enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on
	the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling.
	
	Here in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door
	is ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet.
	
	IN THE CLOSET,
	
	it's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver
	of light appears, coming from above.  We look up.
	
	There is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet,
	it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling.
	
	Roof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so
	slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting.
	A shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
	edges of the portal.
	
	It slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for
	something.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The
	silver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a
	moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel:
	
	ZONE 19 DISABLED
	
	INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT
	
	In the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof
	access panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the
	night sky above.  But we're inside.
	
	And in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down,
	through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and
	climbs silently down the ladder.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In bed, Meg stirs.  An alcohol sleep is a restless one, and
	she's suffering.
	
	She sits up groggily, chugs a glass of water.  Lies down
	again.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for
	the stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's
	going, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs,
	happens to glance to the side as he does so.
	
	He freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top
	floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly
	disturbs him.
	
	A nightlight.  Plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
	bathroom.  (For the record, it's the Power Puff Girls.)  The
	Man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of
	the bathroom.  He looks from the nightlight to the
	countertop.
	
	There's a moving box on the countertop.  His eyes widen.
	This is news to him, bad news.
	
	He takes a step back and a breath.  He turns, looks to the
	end of the hall.  His eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he
	notices something he didn't see before, something coming from
	under the door to the fourth floor bedroom.
	
	Light.  From inside.  From another nightlight.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another
	outlet.  Nearby, Sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked
	off.
	
	The door to Sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly.
	The Man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the
	mountain of moving boxes piled in the room.  His gaze falls
	on Sarah in the bed.
	
	The Man just stares, beside himself.  His lips mouth a word,
	soundlessly.  Doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg flops over in bed, facing away
	from the doorway, really having a rough go of it.  She slept
	too hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her,
	she's really paying the price of four glasses of wine.
	
	She lies still, on her side, facing us.
	
	Behind her, the bedroom door moves, silently.
	
	Opening.
	
	The Man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just
	pushed open.  He stares at the sleeping form of Meg on the
	bed, whose back is to him.  He has no idea she's awake.
	
	Meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a Man is standing in
	the doorway to her bedroom.
	
	Noiselessly, the Man moves away, down the hall.  The moment
	his head disappears down the stairwell --
	
	-- Meg flops over again, facing the doorway.  She closes her
	eyes, gives sleep another try.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The Man walks across the kitchen, shaking his head in
	exasperation at the packing boxes all around him.  He goes to
	the front window, peers outside.  He reaches for a light
	switch on his right.
	
	Through the window, we can see the stoop light go on.  Then
	off, then on and off again.
	
	Still through the window, we see the side panel door of the
	van slide open.
	
	TWO MORE MEN climb out.  They are also dressed in dark
	clothes.  They also carry satchels.
	
	They walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window
	as they approach us.  The first intruder (who has a name,
	it's BURNHAM) steps over to the kitchen door, runs his
	silvery strip through the gap.  Another HUM and spark.
	
	AN ALARM PANEL
	
	flashes again.
	
	ZONE 1 DISABLED
	
	IN THE KITCHEN,
	
	Burnham opens the kitchen door, letting the two other guys
	slip inside.  RAOUL is a hulking figure whose back seems to
	rise up over the top of his slouching head; when he walks it
	looks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him
	forward.  JUNIOR is much smaller, very high-strung, dresses
	like a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the
	street is Park Avenue.
	
	They all freeze, staring at the moving boxes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          A woman and a little girl, both
	          asleep upstairs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fuck!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Keep your voice down.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This was your department, Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're not supposed to be here!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's why the key didn't work, they
	          changed the locks.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen day escrow, man, that's
	          almost three weeks!  They shouldn't
	          be here for another week!  They
	          don't own this house yet!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (pause)
	          Exactly how is fourteen days almost
	          three weeks?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Fourteen business days.  Escrow is
	          always business days.
	
	Burnham sighs.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I mean, right?  Isn't it?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You're an idiot.
	
	Raoul steps forward, shoves Burnham with both hands in the
	chest.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Watch your mouth.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's okay, Raoul.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Junior)
	          Who is this guy?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul is cool.  That's all you need
	          to know.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is insane.  I'm outta here.
	
	He starts for the door.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We
	          can still handle this.
	               (to Raoul)
	          Can we still handle this?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          It's just the woman and the kid?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Unless Daddy comes back later.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Daddy's not coming back, she's in
	          the middle of a divorce, it's just
	          the two of them.  We're okay, here.
	               (to Raoul)
	          We can do this, right?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're fuckin' A we can do this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not with me.  Not with people.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Forty-five minutes.  That's all you
	          said you need.  That's like nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She'll call the cops, they'll be
	          here before I get unpacked.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can
	          totally administrate that part.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No problem.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I don't want Raoul to administrate
	          that part.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They won't get hurt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?  What if she has a
	          gun?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Raoul, what in God's name do we do
	          if she has a gun?
	
	Raoul pulls up his sweatshirt, revealing a .38 tucked into
	his belt.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Asshole.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and
	          you insult him?  Hey, who's the
	          idiot?  Huh?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Where did you get this clown?
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I met him at the tables, same as
	          you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we
	          have a little muscle right about
	          now.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What tables?  I've never seen him
	          before.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Different tables.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (to Raoul)
	          The fuck did you bring a gun for?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're welcome.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Peace out.
	
	He moves for the door.  Junior, trying desperately to hold
	this together, gets there first, blocks the door with his
	back.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We can't do it without you, Burnham.
	
	Junior starts at Burnham.  Raoul stares at Burnham.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          It's still a good plan.  It's
	          just... got a twist.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Kidnapping.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't
	          kidnap somebody in their own house.
	          It's just breaking and entering,
	          unless we take 'em someplace.  Or
	          something like that, I'm pretty
	          sure.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Pure idiot.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An
	          idiot's grandson.  I'm third-
	          generation idiot.  But for once in
	          my life I had a good idea, and I'm
	          not giving up so easy.  You are?
	          Are you actually telling me that for
	          the first time in your life you're
	          gonna throw your cards on the table
	          and go home early?  I can't believe
	          my eyes.
	               (Burnham hesitates)
	          Fourteen million dollars upstairs,
	          Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole.
	          Baby, you'll be so far out of the
	          hole you could draw bricks every
	          night for the next twenty years and
	          still shit green.
	               (Burnham sways)
	          Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg sits up in bed.  She's bleary, her head feels like
	someone rested a manhole cover on it.  She gets up, in the
	dark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her
	way with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark.
	
	She steps through the door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	She walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light
	switch, but can't find it.  She blinks, squints, tries to get
	her bearings.  The only light is a harsh white glow that
	comes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video
	monitors.
	
	She finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds
	her.  She's not in the bathroom.  She's wandered into the
	panic room by mistake.
	
	She turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind
	her.
	
	We linger for a look at the video screens.  If only she'd
	done the same, she'd see what we see.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a
	group, silently debating what to do.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Using the light that spills from the open door to the panic
	room, Meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the
	proper door to the bathroom.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg SNAPS the cap off a jug of Advil and dumps three into her
	palm.  She pops them in her mouth, searches for a glass for
	water, finds none, bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them
	down.
	
	She turns to the toilet.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the monitor, we see the three men leave the kitchen and
	start up the stairs.
	
	INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands, flushes the toilet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Burnham, Raoul, and Junior freeze, just
	coming up the stairs from the kitchen.  They look up, hearing
	the water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly
	above them.
	
	They stare at the ceiling, following with their eyes as a
	pair of feet pad across the CREAKY floor.  Finally, they hear
	a SQUEAK of bedsprings as Meg climbs back into bed.
	
	They hold a moment longer, a silence grows.  Raoul reaches
	into his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask.  He pulls it
	over his head.  They look at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (whispers)
	          No face.
	
	Burnham rolls his eyes.  Doesn't know this guy much, but
	hates him so far.  They start across the foyer toward the
	stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over, to go back to sleep.  She sees she's left the
	lights on in the panic room.  She TSKS, gets out of bed, and
	walks across the floor toward it.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light
	switch --
	
	-- and stops, her hand frozen in mid-air.  She cocks her
	head, looking at something she can't understand.
	
	She blinks.  Takes a step, further into the room.  She stares
	at the video monitors -- at the three men in dark clothes,
	stealing silently across the foyer.
	
	This can't be.  These are just pictures, they have no
	relation to reality.  She drops to her knees, her face inches
	from the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying
	to make sure they're really there.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	They reach the base of the stairs, Junior in the lead.  As he
	reaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot
	short on an angled step and it slips off.  He trips, falls
	forward.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Watching the video monitors, Meg stares in horror as the
	image of Junior slipping is verified by the SLAP of his hands
	on the stairs as he catches himself, audible through the open
	door to the panic room.
	
	She GASPS.  It is real.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Burnham's eyes are wide as saucers,
	staring at Junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet.
	
	Junior points at Raoul, speaks in an urgent whisper.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Top floor, get the little girl and
	          keep her there.  I'll bring the
	          woman up.  Gimme.
	
	He holds out his hand for the gun and Raoul gives it to him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (points to Burnham)
	          Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.
	
	He heads for the stairs.  Raoul follows close behind him.
	Burnham stays, reluctant -- what the fuck has he gotten
	himself into?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg moves.  Leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races across her bedroom, flies out the door, and bolts
	up the carpeted stairs, headed for the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's room, drops onto the bed, and grabs
	Sarah by the shoulders, trying to rouse her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up... wake up...
	
	But she's in a profound child's sleep and won't wake up.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	One floor down, Junior and Raoul reach the third floor
	landing.  Still moving stealthily, Junior heads down the hall
	for the master bedroom, where he thinks Meg is sleeping.
	Raoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is desperate, still can't wake Sarah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wake up...come on, come on...
	
	She sees a plastic cup on her night table/box, half filled
	with water.  She snatches it and tosses the water in her
	face.
	
	Now she's awake.  And pissed off.  She SPUTTERS, SHOUTS.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, at the base of the stairs that lead to the top floor,
	hears the kid shouting.  He starts up the stairs, quickly.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the top floor, Meg is already dragging Sarah out of the
	room and into the hallway.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah come out of Sarah's bedroom just as Raoul
	reaches the top of the stairs at the other end.  They're cut
	off.
	
	Meg freezes, staring at the hulking ski-masked figure at the
	end of the hallway.  She thinks, no idea what to do for a
	second.  She looks frantically to her right -- the bathroom,
	dead end.
	
	She looks to her left.
	
	The elevator.
	
	She yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and
	races inside with Sarah.
	
	Raoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg SLAMS the gate shut and PUNCHES the button for the first
	floor.  The elevator GROANS to life and starts down --
	slowly.
	
	Sarah looks up at her, terrified.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What's going on?!
	
	                     MEG
	          People.  In the house.
	
	As the elevator descends, they see Raoul, through the window
	in the door, as he drops to his knees, to get a good look at
	them.
	
	INT.  TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul turns from the elevator, SHOUTS to the open stairwell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED
	          TOWARD YOU!
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and
	races back down the hall, toward the elevator.  He reaches
	the door, peers through the window.
	
	He sees the bare feet of Meg and Sarah, dropping toward him.
	He grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it
	stays locked, with the elevator moving beyond.
	
	He bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop.  As
	Meg and Sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to
	moving eye with her for a moment.  But the elevator doesn't
	stop, it keeps going down.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg stands frozen, terrified, staring at Junior as they move
	past him.
	
	Junior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can,
	actually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving,
	the catch holds fast and the door won't open.
	
	As they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior flies down the stairs, to cut them off at the first
	floor.
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          He's going down.
	
	                     SARAH
	          That room!
	
	                     MEG
	          What?!
	
	                     SARAH
	          PANIC ROOM!
	
	Meg thinks, then punches the button for three, to go back up.
	
	But the elevator continues down.  She jabs at it, futilely.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.  you gotta...
	
	She reaches past her, pushes the STOP button.  The elevator
	jerks to a halt.  Then Sarah pushes three.  Now the elevator
	starts to rise.
	
	Meg looks at her, impressed.  Love that kid.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	In the foyer, Junior freezes, hearing the elevator stop and
	start again.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
	
	He takes off up the stairs again.  Burnham can't take it
	anymore, he takes off after Junior, following him upstairs.
	
	INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Raoul, still on the top floor, heads for the stairs, fast.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Junior races back up the stairs.  They have her caught in the
	middle.
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	The door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate
	RATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off
	down the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.
	
	Raoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah run through the master bedroom.  As she passes
	the night table, Sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell
	phone from its cradle.  But in her haste she starts to pull
	it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the
	charger.  The phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the
	corner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under
	the bed.
	
	Sarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as Junior
	turns the corner and Raoul thunders down the steps from four.
	
	She abandons the phone, grabs Sarah, and they lunge through
	the open doorway to the panic room.
	
	Junior and Raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom,
	just a few steps away.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the
	doorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door
	wide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at
	the red button on the wall --
	
	-- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --
	
	-- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive
	coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the
	steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --
	
	-- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior SLAMS into the closing metal door, banging his
	shoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rolls over and pulls Sarah into her arms, both of them
	breathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out
	of their minds.
	
	But safe.
	
	She spots the telephone, the one with the special buried
	phone line.  She lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle,
	listens for a dial tone.
	
	Nothing there either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	                     SARAH
	          It doesn't work?!
	
	                     MEG
	          Different phone line, I never hooked
	          it up!
	
	She hurls it down, looks back at Sarah.  She seems a bit
	pale, scared.  She goes to her, holds her, reassures her.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior is slumped at the base of the door, livid, in pain,
	pounding on it with his fists, screaming "NO!" over and over
	again, crazy with rage.
	
	Raoul stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving, hands
	on his knees.
	
	Burnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway,
	looks from Raoul to Junior to the door to the panic room,
	figures out the situation.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me... tell me they're not in
	          there...
	
	We rise up, above them, above the room, looking down on them,
	the rats-in-a-maze shot.
	
	We rise up further still, above where the ceiling ought to
	be, to look down on this room and the one beside it, the room
	behind the four inches of reinforced steel, the panic room in
	which Meg and Sarah kneel in the middle of the floor, holding
	each other tight.
	
	Standoff.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Very close on the metal door, from inside the panic room.  An
	ear moves slowly into frame, presses against the cold steel.
	Listens.
	
	Meg pulls away from the door, shaking her head.
	
	                     MEG
	          Can't hear a thing.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do they want?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't
	          know.
	
	She sits back against a wall, looks around, at the tiny room.
	She's trying not to show how freaked out she is.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What do we do?
	
	                     MEG
	          Wait.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if they get in here?
	
	                     MEG
	          They can't.  They can't get in here.
	          No.  They can't.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I heard you.
	
	                     MEG
	          Feel okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Yeah.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shaky?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Nope.
	
	                     MEG
	          Chills?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	She checks her wristwatch, for some reason.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Don't worry about me.
	
	The implications being, worry about yourself.
	
	Sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies
	them.  Meg crawls over to join her.  They scan the screens.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there are a dozen different views of the house.  Front stoop.
	Kitchen.  Dining room.  Entry floor.  Living room.  Master
	bedroom.  Den.  Top floor bedrooms, both of them.  Top two
	floor hallways.  Even one with a shot of the inside of the
	elevator.
	
	The three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing
	in a tight circle, having a hell of an argument.  Lots of
	gesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a
	word.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the
	right of the video monitors.  She slides over, studies a
	panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small
	grilled area.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey...
	
	Sarah joins her, looks at the buttons.  Each one is labeled
	with a different room name -- den, kitchen, master bedroom,
	etc.  Up in the corner there is a button that says "ALL
	PAGE," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked
	"TALK."
	
	Meg looks at Sarah.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Go ahead.
	
	Meg is reluctant, frightened.  Sarah is encouraging, for the
	first time.
	
	                     SARAH
	          You can do it.
	
	Meg leans forward, clears her throat.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham, Raoul, and Junior are standing in the half-darkened
	living room, in the middle of their argument, when a VOICE
	booms around them.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Excuse me.
	
	They practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for
	the source of the voice.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          The police are on their way.
	
	Only Burnham has remained relatively calm.  After he gets
	over the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera
	that's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and
	stares up at it.  Raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is
	careful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back
	to it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I suggest you leave.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a
	finger from side to side.  He raises a hand, makes a gesture
	like a telephone, then wags his finger again.  The message is
	clear -- you don't have a phone.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is puzzled.
	
	                     MEG
	          How'd he know that?
	
	She presses the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Take what you want and get out.
	
	That sounded fairly tough.  She looks at the monitor again.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then
	they all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning
	in circles, looking for something.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah watch them, confused.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham holds up a finger to the camera -- wait a second --
	while Raoul and Junior rush off screen, looking for
	something.  Junior returns a moment later holding something
	and the three of them hunch over a box, working on something.
	
	After a moment, they break apart and Junior steps up to the
	camera holding a pad of paper.  He shows it to the camera.
	On the top page, in big block letters, they've written.
	
	WHAT WE WANT
	
	After a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second
	page, where four more words are written.
	
	IS IN THAT ROOM.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah GASPS, Meg sits back.
	
	                     MEG
	          "What we want is in that room."
	
	                     SARAH
	          They're coming in here, aren't they?
	
	                     MEG
	          No, I told you, they can't.  It's
	          not a possibility.
	
	Angry, she sits forward and jabs the talk button.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          What do you know about this room?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	there is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first
	draft of a response torn up.  Finally, Junior steps forward
	with another sign:
	
	MORE THAN YOU.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's confidence is ebbing, but she doesn't want to show it.
	She hits the talk button again.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          We're not coming out.  We're not
	          letting you in.  Get out of my
	          house.
	               (clicks off)
	
	                     SARAH
	          Say fuck.
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Fuck.
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Get the fuck out of my house."
	
	                     MEG
	               (into speaker)
	          Get the fuck out of my house!
	
	She clicks off again, looks to Sarah for approval, and gets
	it, sort of, in Sarah's half-smile.  But Sarah's eyes go back
	to the screen.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Answer.
	
	Meg follows Sarah's eyes back to the screen, where another
	message is being held up for them.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the notepad says:
	
	WE WILL LET YOU GO.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah speak at the same time.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, please.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Give me a break.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, her voice booms from the speaker.
	
	                     MEG (O.S.)
	          Conversation's over.
	
	With an audible CLICK, she signs off.  Burnham, Raoul, and
	Junior stand arrayed beneath the camera, staring up at it,
	dumbfounded.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Got her right where you want her,
	          Junior.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When you said you'd let 'em go I
	          thought she'd come running right out
	          for sure.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shut up and let me think.
	
	He opens a pack of cigarettes, takes out a joint and lights
	it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'm afraid to let you think, Junior.
	          Things get worse when you think.
	               (sniffs)
	          Oh, that's gonna help.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	               (holding in a hit)
	          Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are
	          we gonna do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What if she called the cops?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She didn't.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She said she did.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She lied.  Cops woulda been here by
	          now if she called 'em.  Besides,
	          Junior cut the phones.
	
	Burnham goes to the window and stares outside.  He laughs,
	covers his face.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What the fuck is funny about this?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          There is not one thing funny here.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Who else but God could think this
	          shit up?  I spend ten years building
	          those fucking rooms to keep people
	          out, now I gotta figure out how to
	          get in.  God, man, He just loves the
	          irony.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic
	          and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are
	          you gonna get us into that room?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in
	          the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          So what the fuck are we supposed to
	          do?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Make her come out.  And when she
	          does, that's when we gotta be
	          careful.  She can't get out of this
	          house.  She can't even think she can
	          get out of this house.  We just keep
	          them here and keep them quiet for
	          forty-five minutes.  And I don't
	          want
	               (Raoul)
	          Joe Pesci here standing over them
	          with his fat sweaty finger on the
	          trigger.  That's a sure way for us
	          to end up with two dead bodies and
	          little puffs of smoke burning out of
	          our heads up in Greenhaven.  So
	          we're gonna seal the place up.  They
	          wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll
	          help 'em.  Make it impossible for
	          them to leave.  Once they come out
	          of that room.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And why exactly would they want to
	          come out?
	
	At the window, Burnham notices something sitting just outside
	the French doors, on the balcony.  It's a large outdoor
	barbecue grill.  He thinks, takes a step closer.
	
	He sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the
	grill.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Workin' on it.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg is sitting cross-legged on the floor,
	leaning against a wall, but Sarah is in motion, sorting
	through shelves, opening drawers.  Every drawer has something
	in it, sealed under plastic.  She opens and closes, sorts and
	lifts finds the following:
	
	Waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	Flashlights.
	
	Unopened packages of batteries.
	
	Sealed water bags stamped "PURE FIVE YEARS FROM DATE."
	
	Tinned food.
	
	Flares.
	
	Pillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are
	stamped FIREPROOF BLANKET).
	
	A complete tool kit.
	
	As Sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at
	the end of the room, down on the floor at eye level.
	
	It's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a
	four-pronged cloverlike seal.  The portal is closed tight, as
	Sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it
	resists her attempts to crank it open.
	
	Meg notices.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey.  Relax, okay?
	
	But Sarah keeps at it, feels along the edges of the portal,
	then all along the wall, looking for some kind of hidden
	switch that controls it.
	
	                     MEG
	          I mean it, lie down.  You get your
	          adrenaline up and you know what's
	          gonna happen.
	
	Sarah stops, looks at her mother, who is pale and wan,
	huddled in the corner.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you freaking out?
	
	                     MEG
	          Little bit.  Yeah.
	
	Sarah looks around the room.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Small space?
	
	                     MEG
	               (nods, fast)
	          Don't though.
	               (talk about it, that is)
	
	Sarah looks at her, thinks.  It's not an unfamiliar
	situation, her needing to comfort her mother.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          What am I, a five year old?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Why did the chicken cross the road?
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't know, why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          To prove he wasn't chicken.
	
	Meg tries to push a smile across her face, but it's
	immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens.
	Her eyes show alarm, staring at the kitchen.
	
	                     MEG
	          What the hell are they doing?
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	The contents of one of the satchels is dumped out over the
	kitchen counter, every kind of tool imaginable, many that are
	unfamiliar to us.  They sort through the pile, choosing
	things.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN FLOOR - REAR DOORS - NIGHT
	
	At the French doors that lead to the garden, Burnham has a
	cordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand.
	He reaches up, drills a screw through the door, into the
	corner of the door frame.  He does the same at the bottom of
	the door.
	
	He unlocks the doorknob, tries it.  The screws hold the door
	fast.  He moves on, to the next door.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg stares at the video screens, eyes
	wide, terrified.  She watches them.  Can't take her eyes off
	them.
	
	                     MEG
	               (barely audible)
	          ... locking us in...
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	In the library, in the front of the house, Raoul screws shut
	a window, driving the long screws into its frame.  He looks
	out at the street, at two CLUBGOERS walking home.
	
	He pulls the drape.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg's hands are over her mouth, she's trembling, shaking her
	head from side to side.  This can't be happening.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	In the kitchen, Junior goes to the wall phone Meg used to
	call for pizza earlier.  He cuts the phone wire with a
	knife.
	
	He stands there, staring at the phone, wiping the sweat from
	his palms on his pants.  Not satisfied, he pulls the phone
	itself out of the wall, cuts the cord for the handset too.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg pushes herself back into the corner of the panic room,
	horrified.  Sweat has broken out on her forehead, her whole
	body seems to vibrate.  Sarah comes over, leans in front of
	her.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Mom?
	
	But Sarah's voice is hollow, seems far away.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Are you okay?
	
	Meg looks at her.  As she watches, Sarah floats away from
	her.  In fact, the entire room is floating away from her,
	elongating.
	
	And narrowing.  Meg looks to the sides, and the walls don't
	just seem like they're pushing in on her, they are pushing in
	on her.
	
	Meg opens her mouth, screams, but no sound comes out.
	
	Sarah stands up and bends over her, but now she's just a
	figure far away, all the way at the end of a long, impossibly
	narrow hall.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (barely heard)
	          MOM?!  MOM!!
	
	Meg crawls out, into the middle of that hallway, to get away
	from the wall, but they both continue moving in on her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Not here... not here... someplace
	          else... someplace else...
	
	Her eyes roll back into her head, we see just the whites, and
	she loses her balance, falling over onto her back.
	
	We fall with her, move in tight on her face, and the dark
	hallway carpet beneath it turns to green, all green, grassy
	green.  She sits up, looks around, and we realize she is in
	fact somewhere else, she's --
	
	EXT.  GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	-- in the middle of the Great Lawn, in Central Park.  She
	stands, turns in a circle, she's completely alone on the
	great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring
	day, tall buildings sparkling in the distance.
	
	Meg stretches her arms out, smiles, but far off in the
	distance, she hears a voice calling to her, dimly:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom?!  Mom!!
	
	Meg ignores the voice, she's so happy to be out here, out in
	the open, in the beautiful wide open, she could stay here
	forever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's
	that voice again, insistent:
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          Mom, please!!
	
	There is the sharp sound of a SLAP, and Meg's face abruptly
	jerks to the side.  She touches her cheek, confused, as a hot
	red handprint rises up on it.
	
	What the hell was that?
	
	BAM!
	
	Now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
	deafening CRUNCH.  The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she
	turns.  Where did that come from?
	
	BAM!  Another one, even louder.  Meg's whole body winces at
	the sound.
	
	BAM!  A third one, and on this one Meg falls to her knees,
	covering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on
	the Great Lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and
	she's right back --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- in the panic room, where she always was, and that pounding
	is real, it's right outside the door, it's like somebody's
	trying to smash their way right through the wall.
	
	Sarah is right over Meg, holding her by the arms, and that
	handprint on Meg's face is real, Sarah must have slapped her
	to try to bring her out of it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING
	          IN!
	
	Meg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another
	deafening BANG crunches into it from outside.
	
	BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  The sound is deafening.  Sarah throws both
	hands over her ears.  Meg looks around, still disoriented.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK
	          OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY
	          HERE WITH ME!
	
	                     MEG
	          I am.  I'm here.
	
	                     SARAH
	          YOU HAVE TO!
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm here.  I'm here.
	
	They huddle there, terrified.  Meg blinks, wipes the sweat
	from her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her
	head, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,
	tries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an
	ordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing
	digital display:
	
	120
	
	Meg nods, as if reassuring herself.
	
	                     MEG
	          We're fine.  We're okay.
	
	She turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell
	they're doing out there.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	BAM!
	
	In the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the
	sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
	
	The intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is
	like a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
	end of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the
	hole.
	
	As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall
	behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and
	beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.
	
	But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,
	reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into
	the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham
	tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the
	duct.
	
	CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.
	Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.
	This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along
	with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists
	it into the drill.
	
	At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.
	A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit
	tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size
	of a quarter.
	
	Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a
	coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul
	tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in
	the air as it snakes across the room.
	
	Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's
	just drilled in the air duct.
	
	RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
	connection, makes it airtight.
	
	SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot
	section of the garden hose off the coil.
	He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five
	gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor
	up here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of
	the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red
	block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.
	
	PROPANE
	CAUTION - FLAMMABLE
	
	Along with a number of other dire warnings.
	
	Burnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't
	really want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either.
	
	He spins it open.  Halfway.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I did.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He said open it.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Just sending a message.  She'll get
	          the point.
	
	Gas HISSES through the spigot and into the hose.  We follow
	along the length of the hose, across the floor of the room,
	through the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been
	drilled in the air duct --
	
	INSIDE THE WALL
	
	-- through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines
	of an air vent up ahead.  We squeeze between two of the
	horizontal lines --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and come out in the panic room.  Three red streamers, tied
	to the air vent, flap to life as the gas HISSES into the
	panic room.
	
	Directly underneath the vent, Meg is hunched up against the
	wall, her arm around Sarah.
	
	She sniffs.
	
	Again.
	
	Sarah sniffs.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	She looks up.  Sees the streamers floating above her.
	
	She leaps to her feet, steps up onto a shelf, and stretches
	her nose toward the streamers.  Just as she does --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Near the tank, Raoul shoves Burnham out of the way.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We ain't playin', here.
	
	He cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way.
	The gas pours into the hose with an audible WHOOSH.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, at the vent, falls back, two lungfuls of propane, and
	drops to her knees on the floor.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What, what, what is it?!
	
	                     MEG
	          On the floor!  Get on the floor!
	
	Now Sarah coughs.  The gas is pouring into the room.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul is standing guard over the tank, to make sure no one
	messes with the valve.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Look, don't be stupid...
	
	Junior has his head pressed against the door to the panic
	room, trying to hear any sounds from within.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Be quiet.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're trying to scare them, not kill
	          them!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          They're coughing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          They're gonna die in there!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Nobody is gonna die, man, will you
	          please have the balls to follow
	          through with a good idea?  Think
	          about it, what would you do if you
	          were them, stay in there and choke
	          to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're
	          just getting them to come out for
	          forty-five minutes, forty-five
	          fucking minutes!  The worst that's
	          gonna happen is they pass out, we
	          drag 'em out here into the fresh
	          air, and they'll be fine.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are
	          we supposed to get into the room if
	          they pass out?
	
	Pause.  Junior turns to Raoul.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Cut it back a little bit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          No fucking way.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          He's right, we can't get into the
	          room if they're dead!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their
	mouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not
	working.  Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near
	to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing
	again.
	
	Finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the
	clover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.
	
	The portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a
	tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source
	directly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends
	down and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at
	the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside
	through it.
	
	She sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her.
	She does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of
	the tube, gulping fresh air greedily.
	
	Meg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor
	at the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.
	Burnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on
	the valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and
	hurls him aside.
	
	Burnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at
	Raoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,
	trying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their
	voices down.
	
	It's bedlam.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She
	turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the
	streamers still stream.
	
	She looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found
	the waterproof matches and lighters.
	
	She thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
	and crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches
	up a screwdriver.
	
	Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,
	but can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.
	
	In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
	blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her
	disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of
	air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.
	
	She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the
	shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the
	vent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,
	she unscrews the vent cover.
	
	The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,
	past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the
	wall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her
	fingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it
	once.
	
	Too slow.  Not even a spark.
	
	Her hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with
	the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it
	makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the
	duct with a hollow BOOM.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns abruptly.
	
	He turns around.  They all freeze, listening.  He hears it
	again.  The hollow BOOM, coming from inside the wall.  Now a
	third time.
	
	He walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.
	
	BOOM.
	
	He moves closer, gets right up next to the wall.  He leans
	into the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct.
	This close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's
	two sounds.
	
	SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	He arches an eyebrow.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	Meg's hand is trembling, tiring.  She tries again, thumbs the
	flint wheel.  It SCRATCHES as it rolls, her hand twitches,
	BOOMS against the side of the duct.
	
	Still, the gas HISSES through.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face is turning color, she's running out of air.  Her
	feet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing.
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	she tries again.  SCRATCH.  BOOM.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	Burnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh.
	
	He tears himself away from the wall --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn --
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	-- Burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the
	propane tank --
	
	INSIDE THE DUCT,
	
	-- Meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and
	a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the
	panic room, the other toward the bedroom.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from
	the vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame.
	She drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's
	body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into
	a lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent
	light tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere.
	
	IN THE BEDROOM,
	
	the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through
	the hose, backing up toward the tank.
	
	Burnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the
	other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue
	flame erupts from the end of the hose.
	
	The flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire,
	his chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the
	blankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS
	and rolls on the floor in pain.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
	another angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame
	that Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one
	of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a
	flickering, uneven light on the room.
	
	She stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,
	breathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making
	no sense whatsoever.
	
	She stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed
	admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.
	
	Meg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned
	off.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the
	shoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.
	
	Meg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Out in the bedroom, it's worse for Burnham, who has lost most
	of his hair and shirt.  But his skin isn't badly burned,
	which is something, I guess.
	
	Still, he's in a rage.  He POUNDS the metal door of the panic
	room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM
	          COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN
	          THERE!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg whirls, goes to the door herself, SCREAMS right back.  We
	can hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds
	threatening.
	
	Suddenly, she stops, hearing something else.  Outside the
	door, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound,
	a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall
	that's shared with the brownstone next door.
	
	It's a faint -- very faint -- POUNDING sound, along with a
	high pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be
	heard.  Sarah hears it too.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Neighbor!
	
	Meg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING
	at the tops of their lungs -- get help, call the police,
	please, call the police, that sort of thing.
	
	They shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if
	their voices are as soft on the other side as the COMPLAINING
	VOICE is on this side, they have no hope.
	
	Their voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by
	the gas to shout for very long.  Long after they stop, the
	soft POUNDING from next door continues.
	
	Their pleas are not heard.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The Intruders have stopped their racket too, and are
	listening carefully at the common wall.  Eventually, the soft
	POUNDING stops, the complaining voice complains no more.
	
	Burnham stands there, in pain.  Things are falling apart.
	Raoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway
	light.  He draws himself up to his full, bulky height.  He's
	big.
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (to Junior)
	          We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.
	
	Junior nods and starts out.  Raoul lets him pass, but when
	Burnham tries to follow him, Raoul puts a big hand on his
	chest stopping him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You stay.  Make sure she don't come
	          out.
	
	Burnham swallows.  But stays.
	
	Raoul turns, follows Junior downstairs.  As he descends, he
	looks up, making eye contact with Burnham.  And holding it.
	Something on his mind, that's for sure.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	THUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the
	floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.
	
	But Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,
	rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea
	forming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight
	and loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing
	around the room.
	
	Halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she
	flashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?
	
	Sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
	discovered earlier.  She squints through it.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the
	brownstone.
	
	About thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
	brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because
	the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can
	see straight into somebody's bedroom.
	
	There's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book
	on his chest.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sits back.
	
	She grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the
	top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.
	Shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a
	wall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to
	the tube.
	
	Meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah
	shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving
	enough room on either side of it for them to see through.
	Meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside
	her.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?
	
	Sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on
	the top of the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the
	courtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.
	The light flashes on the wall over his bed.
	
	The flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long.
	Long.  Long.  Short.  Short.  Short.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns to Sarah, impressed.
	
	                     MEG
	          Morse code?
	
	                     SARAH
	               (nods)
	          Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	          dot.
	
	                     MEG
	          Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
	
	                     SARAH
	          "Titanic."
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the flashes continue -- dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
	dot.  But the Man continues to sleep, the light on the wall
	behind him has no effect.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah is frustrated.  She adjusts the flashlight.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is
	shining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot.  She's
	starting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the
	watch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:
	
	114
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man stirs.  Opens his eyes.  Winces from the
	light, which is flashing directly in his eyes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Got him!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Come on, come on...
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	the Sleeping Man sits up.  Raises a hand, trying to block the
	light, which keeps flashing on him.
	
	He gets up, out of bed.  He comes to the window.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, yes, yes, yes...
	
	Sarah keeps it up, flashing faster.
	
	THROUGH THE TUBE,
	
	they see the Man come all the way to his window.  He leans
	against it, cups his hands so he can see better.  The flashes
	continue, right on top of him now.
	
	Clearly, the Man is reading the flashes!  He takes a steps
	back from the window --
	
	-- gives them the finger --
	
	-- and angrily yanks shut his drapes.
	
	A moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah drop their heads to the carpet, defeated.
	
	Sarah rolls over, knocks the flashlight away, stares up at
	the ceiling.
	
	Meg puts a hand in her hair.  It was a good idea.
	
	                     SARAH
	          We're never getting out of here.
	
	                     MEG
	          Shhh...
	
	She looks at the wristwatch again.
	
	103
	
	She's concerned.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is concerned as well.  He's still in the master
	bedroom, but barely, he's standing in the doorway, straining
	like hell to hear a conversation that Junior and Raoul are
	having in the foyer, one floor one.
	
	They're trying to keep their voices down, but stray words
	float up through the open stairwell -- words like "him" and
	"warning" and "dangerous."
	
	Burnham chews a fingernail.  If only he could get closer.  He
	throws a look back at the door to the panic room.  He looks
	back out the bedroom door.  Listening.
	
	INT.  FOYER - NIGHT
	
	Junior and Raoul are huddled together in the foyer.  They're
	keeping their voices low, but their conversation is heated.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're not gonna do anything about
	          him, he's fine.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          If you think I'm gonna let my half
	          of the fourteen million bucks slip
	          away because of --
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          "Half?"  What did you, take a nap in
	          math class?  Three people, three
	          shares, one third.  Four point six
	          six six repeating.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I'm just saying, the man is a
	          problem.  And he's your problem.
	          Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your
	          idea, none of this was your idea, it
	          was mine, it's my family we're
	          ripping off, it's my prick
	          grandfather who built that fucking
	          room, it was my idea to get the
	          plans, I found the floor safe, and
	          it was my idea to ask a guy who
	          builds these rooms to help break
	          into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at
	          no point did I say "you" or Raoul,"
	          got it?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          He puts his hands on me again I'll
	          bury a slug in his ear.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          No, you will not, because without
	          Burnham there's no way in hell we're
	          gonna get into that safe, so as far
	          as I'm concerned he can paint your
	          ass blue and run it up a flagpole
	          and you won't lay a finger on him,
	          you understand me?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't take no tone of voice with me,
	          Homes.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          What is this shit you're talking all
	          of a sudden?  You're a bus driver,
	          "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so
	          please don't start spouting some
	          Elmore Leonard shit you just heard
	          because I saw that movie too,
	
	ON THE VIDEO MONITORS,
	
	Junior and Raoul are visible, still arguing in the foyer.
	
	On the next monitor over, Burnham is visible, standing in the
	master bedroom doorway, listening.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg is watching the monitors, thinking.  She notices
	something, sits forward abruptly, looking at the monitor that
	covers the master bedroom.  She squeezes right up close,
	staring at the screen.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	we peer closely at the box next to her bed, the one she was
	using for a night table.  On top of the box, she sees the
	charger for her cellular phone, sitting empty.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back, eyes alive with an idea.  If only she could
	get to that phone, which must be still under the bed.  She
	looks back at the monitors, at Burnham lingering in the
	doorway to the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn.
	
	She turns away from the monitors, to check on Sarah, who's
	settled into a corner of the room, looking pale.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham is desperate.  The argument
	downstairs is entering round two, and he's got to hear what
	they're saying.
	
	He takes a few steps out of the bedroom --
	
	INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	-- and comes into the hallway.  He leans over the stairwell.
	Where he's standing, he is directly under the camera that
	covers the hallway --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- and can't be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg turns back from Sarah, to look at the monitors again.
	She see Burnham is no longer in the bedroom.  And doesn't
	appear to be in the hallway, either.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh yes, yes...
	
	She looks at another monitor.
	
	ON THE MONITOR,
	
	she sees Junior and Raoul in the foyer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg sits back.  That leaves Burnham unaccounted for.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... the hell is he?
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham is still lingering under the camera.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah has come forward to the monitors as well.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Do it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah, but where's the third guy?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
	
	Meg goes to the door, raises a hand to the green "open"
	button.  Hesitates.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we see Burnham, lurking in the hallway, just about six feet
	from the door to the panic room.  Don't open that door!
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg wipes sweat from her palm.
	
	                     MEG
	          If it looks like I can't get back,
	          just close the door.
	
	                     SARAH
	          No.
	
	                     MEG
	          Close it!
	
	Sarah nods, looks back to the button.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	a shouted CURSE rises up from downstairs.  Burnham takes a
	step toward the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	he suddenly appears, in the hallway.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees it.
	
	                     SARAH
	          WAIT!
	
	Meg freezes.  She looks at the monitor, wide-eyed.  Close
	one.
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	Burnham can't take it anymore.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, hell...
	
	He turns and takes off down the stairs.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer, next
	to Junior and Raoul.   
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg and Sarah see all three men accounted for, downstairs.
	
	                     SARAH
	          GO GO GO!
	
	Meg leaps up, runs to the door, and punches the green button.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The door begins to crank open, Meg slips through the gap
	sideways before it's even all the way open.  She darts across
	the room --
	
	-- slides to the floor next to the bed --
	
	-- and flattens herself, reaching underneath it to get the
	phone.  Damn, that phone slid far, it's right in the middle,
	wouldn't you know it.
	
	IN THE FOYER,
	
	the three men hear her footsteps, as one, they take off for
	the stairs.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg continues to stretch, her fingers inches from the phone.
	
	ON THE STAIRWELL,
	
	feet race up toward her --
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	Meg's fingernails paw the phone, pull it closer to her.  She
	grabs it, stands --
	
	IN THE HALLWAY,
	
	the three men come off the stairs and race toward her, they
	see her as she lunges across, toward the panic room, she
	hurls herself through the door --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	-- and Sarah SMACKS the red button.  The steel door closes
	with a deafening WHANG.
	
	Safe.
	
	IN THE ENTRYWAY,
	
	the echo of the metallic WHANG reverberates through the
	house.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Meg punches 9-1-1 on her cell phone with
	trembling fingers.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	The big empty charger cradle is in the foreground when the
	three men burst into the room.  Burnham stops in the middle
	of the floor, turns in a frantic circle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What'd she get, what'd she get,
	          what'd she get...
	
	His eyes fall on the empty charger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Cell phone.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Shit!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg raises the cell phone to her ear --
	
	-- and gets a rapid busy signal.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, no.  No, no, no no no no no...
	
	She looks at the phone.  It's showing just one signal bar,
	and even that one is flashing on and off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh come on, come on, come on...
	
	She walks around the room, raises the phone high and low,
	trying crazily to find a signal.
	
	But can't.   
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Burnham stands just outside the door,
	fingertips lightly resting on it, the ghost of a smile on his
	face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (softly)
	          I don't think we'll be talking on
	          our cell phone from in there...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Inside the room, Meg doesn't seem upset.  Rather, she's
	staring at the cell phone in her hand, thinking.  Remembering
	something.
	
	                     MEG
	          Wires...
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	At the same moment, Burnham is having the same thought.  He's
	still at the door, fingertips still resting there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Phone...
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	                     MEG
	          ... wires.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham looks down, at the baseboard below.  What is he
	looking at?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps up, onto the shelf she climbed earlier, and comes
	up next to the vent.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What are you doing?
	
	                     MEG
	          I saw something, I saw...
	
	In the vent, alongside the duct, she sees the bundle of
	multicolored wires she saw earlier.
	
	                     MEG
	          ... phone wires!
	
	She jumps down off the shelf, goes to the tools, starts
	searching for something.
	
	                     MEG
	          I may not have hooked up the phone
	          in here, but I hooked up the main
	          line, and there's a jack at the base
	          of this wall outside, I saw it!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Yes, that is correct, there is in fact a jack in the base of
	the wall outside the door to the panic room.
	
	Burnham bends down into frame, studying it, thinking the same
	thing she is.  He clears his throat.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Say, while we're on the subject of
	          phones...
	
	He turns, looks up at Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          When I said cut the line, did you
	          cut the main line at the junction
	          box in the basement like I said, and
	          which I repeated, or did you just
	          cut the cord on the phone in the
	          kitchen?
	
	Pause.  Swallow.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          I, uh, I...
	
	Shit.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          ... hit a little snag finding the
	          one in the basement.
	
	Shit.
	
	Pause.  Then, as if a starting gun has been fired, Burnham
	leaps to his feet and races out of the bedroom.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	That same starting gun has been fired in the panic room.
	With a strong RIP, Meg pulls the whole bundle of multi
	colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with
	it.  She trusts it at Sarah, finds a wire cutter in the
	assorted tools, and gives her that too.
	
	                     MEG
	          Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue
	          first, blue is phones!
	
	                     SARAH
	          Blue is phones?
	
	                     MEG
	          Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
	
	While Sarah goes to work on the wires, Meg turns to the phone
	itself, the one with the buried phone line that isn't working
	yet.  She rips the phone out of its housing, tears free the
	wire on the end of it.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs from the third floor, races
	across the foyer, flies down the stairs to the kitchen floor.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races across the kitchen floor, whips open a door and
	heads down another, narrow, darkened stairway.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah are like animals, clawing and tearing at the
	ends of their respective phone cables, foregoing tools and
	stripping the wires with fingers and teeth, it's faster.
	
	With the phone receiver cradled on her shoulder, Meg starts
	twisting the ends of wires onto the exposed ends of the wires
	from the phone unit.  First wire -- nothing.  She tries a
	second wire.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SLAMS open the door to a dark room, pulls the string
	on a bare bulb.  Burned out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          God damn it!
	
	Without light, he can't see a thing.  He SMACKS the bulb, it
	swings wildly, SMASHES on the cement wall.  He turns and
	races out of the room.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries another wire.  Still no dial tone.  Sarah shoves
	another wire at her.  She tries again.  Nothing.  She moves
	on.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham slides to his knees, snatches a flashlight from his
	duffel, leaps up and takes off again.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Another wire.  Nothing.  Another wire.  DIAL TONE!
	
	Meg SHRIEKS and punches 911.
	
	INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT
	
	Burnham flies down the stairs, flashlight beam bouncing
	crazily in front of him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The phone is ringing.  An operator picks up.
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          911 emergency --
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm at 26 West --
	
	                     OPERATOR
	          -- please hold.
	
	It's a mechanical voice, which gives over to MUZAK.
	
	                     MEG
	          NO!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham BANGS through the door again, starts searching the
	darkened mechanical room, shining harsh light around its
	dingy walls.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	MUZAK continues to play.
	
	                     MEG
	          Damn it!
	
	No more time to hold.  Meg hangs up the phone, dials another
	number, a seven digit one she knows by heart.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Call Dad!
	
	                     MEG
	          On it!
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the mechanical room, the bouncing flashlight beam falls on
	a metal cabinet across the way.  Burnham runs to it, flings
	it open.  Circuit breakers.  SLAMS it shut.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg listens as a phone rings on the other end.  And rings.
	And rings again.
	
	This is torture.
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham turns, sees another, smaller metal box, this one
	clearly labeled:
	
	PHONES
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	On the other end of the phone, a husky MALE VOICE answers;
	clearly he's been awakened.
	
	                     VOICE
	          Hello?
	
	                     MEG
	          Listen to me!  There are three --
	
	INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With a subhuman ROAR of anger, Burnham rips the entire phone
	panel off the wall with his bare hands.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	With an abrupt SHRIEK, the line goes dead.  Meg pauses, can't
	believe it.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hello?  Don't... are...
	
	She looks up, see Sarah looking at her, her eyebrows arches,
	her face all hope.  Meg keeps her cool, but it take a hell of
	an effort.
	
	Sarah reads her face.  She turns away.
	
	She hangs up the phone.
	
	Sarah goes to a corner of the room, faces away from her.
	
	Meg doesn't know what to say.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll do something.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Uh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          He'll know we're in trouble.  He
	          heard me, I said "There are
	          three..."
	
	                     SARAH
	          He won't even know who it was.
	
	                     MEG
	          What would you think, in the middle
	          of the night?  I mean, three what,
	          three bears?  He'll call the police.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Stop it.
	
	                     MEG
	          He's just across the park, this is
	          why we got places so close to each
	          other, in case we needed each other,
	          we're still a family, he'll help
	          us...
	
	                     SARAH
	          He --
	
	                     MEG
	          He WILL.
	
	She practically shouted.  Sarah drop her head into her arms.
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm sorry.
	
	                     MEG
	          Why?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I was trying not to tell you...
	
	                     MEG
	          What?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy and thirsty.
	
	Meg blanches.  This is very bad news.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Tired, Burnham drags himself back up the stairs and into the
	doorway of the master bedroom.  Raoul and Junior stand there,
	staring at him.
	
	Long pause.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          She's never coming out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          And we're never getting in.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Do me a favor and don't talk.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Jesus, what was I thinking?
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg has torn open one of the water packets and is trying to
	get Sarah to drink, but the little girl has gone completely
	pale and seems to have lost some of the strength in her neck,
	she's having trouble holding her head up.  Most of the water
	runs down her chin.
	
	                     MEG
	          Come on, come on... stay with me...
	          you gotta drink...
	
	She takes Sarah's hand, checks her wristwatch thing.  The
	readout is now
	
	82
	
	She swallows.  She grabs Sarah by the face.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, listen, honey, you went double
	          digit here, you must have been
	          shooting out adrenaline like crazy,
	          we gotta bring your blood sugar back
	          up, okay?  Can you hear me?
	
	                     SARAH
	          I'm dizzy, not deaf.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, she's still a smart ass,
	          excellent sign.  Did you see any
	          sugar in here?  Any candy bars,
	          anything sweet?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Huh uh.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, you just gotta calm yourself
	          down, that's all, just stay calm and
	          your adrenaline will go back to
	          normal and you'll be fine.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I keep dropping?
	
	                     MEG
	          Not an option.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I do?
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the bedroom, Junior has had enough.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          We're leaving.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The hell we are.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, after all we went through I
	          am not walking out when we're this
	          close.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Close?  Are you insane?  We're
	          nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll
	          make an anonymous phone call on
	          Monday, they'll find the floor safe,
	          and I'll inherit the shit.  Little
	          piece of it, anyway, it's better
	          than nothing.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What about us?
	
	Junior thinks, then pulls out his wallet.  He thrusts a
	fistful of bills at them.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Here.  For your time.
	
	They both just stare at him.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Five hundred bucks here.
	
	Neither one of them moves to take it.  Junior shurgs, drops
	it on the floor.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Suit yourself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Observe.
	
	He heads for the door, expecting Raoul to block him, but as
	he draws close --
	
	-- Raoul just steps out of the way.  Junior passes through
	and heads for the stairs.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          We're not leaving.  I'm getting in
	          that room, and I'm opening that
	          safe.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but
	          ten out of ten for attitude.
	
	And he disappears, down the stairs, Burnham still pleading
	with him.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg rifles the foodstuffs that are stored in the room.
	Sarah, in the corner, is starting to tremble.
	
	                     SARAH
	          What if I spazz out?
	
	                     MEG
	               (forced calm)
	          No biggie, we've been through it a
	          dozen times, I just jab you with the
	          Glucogen.
	
	Pause.  She keeps looking.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Where is the Glucogen?
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the
	          little fridge in your room.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (pause)
	          I'm sorry, Mom.
	
	                     MEG
	          Hey, quit apologizing, you're
	          starting to sound like Grandma.
	          You're not gonna have an attack.
	          Okay?
	
	                     SARAH
	          Okay.   
	
	She lays back, oddly passive, her lips changing color.  She
	stares at the monitors.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Junior strides into the living room, purposefully.  He tosses
	some tools into his duffel bag and heads for the stairs down
	to the kitchen.  Burnham is behind him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Would you wait?  Would you please
	          just wait a minute?
	
	But Junior heads down.  Burnham follows.  Raoul is just
	coming down from upstairs.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Junior reaches the door of the kitchen, tries to open it,
	realizes it's screwed shut.  He takes out a screwdriver and
	starts unscrewing the screws.  Burnham stops at the stairway.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You walk out that door and you lose
	          your share of the money.
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Yeah, whatever.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I mean it!
	
	                     JUNIOR
	          Adios.
	
	He gets the last screw out, throws open the door, and BLAST
	of wind gusts in, it's a blustery night out there, he takes a
	step into the doorway --
	
	-- and with a quiet PFFFT from right behind Burnham, a bullet
	whizzes across the kitchen and hits Junior in the back of the
	head.  He crumples, right in the open kitchen doorway.
	
	Burnham SHOUTS incoherently and turns.  Raoul is standing
	there, two steps up, a silencer twisted onto the barrel of
	his gun.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Nobody leaves.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah is staring at the video monitors, eyes wide.  She
	raises one trembling finger, points at the kitchen monitor,
	tries to mouth the words, can't.
	
	Meg looks up.
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	Burnham is freaking out, but trying to stay calm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh God... oh, my God...
	
	Raoul walks past him calmly, grabs Junior by the ankles, and
	drags him back into the house.  He turns, looks at Burnham,
	whose jaw is dropped in horror.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You should see the look on your
	          face.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The fuck did you do that for?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me.
	          Drives his German car up to 125th
	          Street a couple of times, buys a few
	          rounds, thinks he's a tough guy,
	          thinks he knows me.
	               (to the corpse)
	          You don't know one thing about me!
	
	While Burnham stares down at the body in shock and Raoul
	stares at Burnham, his back to the outside, a small, thin
	VOICE comes from the still-open doorway.
	
	                     VOICE
	          What the h --
	
	They turn.  A man, fiftyish, stands there in hastily thrown
	on clothes, staring down at the dead body in mute shock.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg, watching the monitors with Sarah, GASPS as she sees the
	man, whose name is HARRIS.  While she and Sarah watch --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	-- they see the silent image of Harris, set upon by Raoul,
	who grabs him roughly and drags him inside.  Burnham hurries
	to the door --
	
	INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
	
	-- and SLAMS it shut.  He puts his back to it, thinking,
	terrified, things are spinning out of control, fast.
	
	Raoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some
	more of his rage on Harris, whom he has hurled to the floor.
	He lands a solid boot in the side of Harris's head, leaving
	him GROANING in pain, completely disoriented.
	
	Harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming
	from underneath Junior.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Stop it!  Stop it!
	
	                     RAOUL
	               (turning on him)
	          Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's
	          the fucking clown now?!
	
	He pulls his gun, shoves it into Burnham's eye, hard, we can
	hear the faint SIZZLE of skin burning.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Me.  I am.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's right.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I have the gun.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yes.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Remember that.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Please...
	
	Raoul pulls the gun back, just an inch.  The skin around
	Burnham's eye is an angry red.  His eyes dart, strain to look
	over at Harris, MOANING on the floor.  And at Junior, dead.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What?  What do you want me to do?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          What do you think?  Get us into that
	          room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't.
	
	Raoul pushes the gun barrel back into Burnham's eye socket.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You can.  You're full of ideas.  You
	          just need to squeeze one out.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got till the count of three.
	          Then you end up like him.
	
	He tilts his head over to Junior, whose brains are spreading
	out on the kitchen floor.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          One.  Squeeze.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          This is ridiculous...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Two.  Squeeze harder.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I can't just...
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Th --
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, okay!  Okay.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You got an idea?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta
	          check something.
	
	Raoul GRUNTS, satisfied.  Pulls the gun back.  Burnham slides
	away, shaking.  He bends down, to the floor.  He looks at
	Harris's left hand.  At his index finger.
	
	He sees a white strip of skin, where Harris wore his wedding
	ring, until recently.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris, still semi-conscious, is hurled against the metal
	door of the panic room.  He collapses at its base.  Burnham,
	bends down next to him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, look.  I know you can hear me.
	          Your wife and kid are in there.
	          You're gonna get 'em to come out.
	          Or --
	
	He looks up at Raoul, hulking overhead, gun in hand.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Or I can't stop what he's gonna do.
	          Do you understand?
	
	Harris, regaining some semblance of consciousness, nods
	feebly.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Good.
	
	Burnham stands up, turns to the video camera, and SHOUTS.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah and Meg see the horrifying sight on the video monitors.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at the door to the room.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          OPEN UP!
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	they see Burnham, standing over Harris; they faintly hear him
	call to them to open the door.
	
	And then they hear another VOICE, calling back to them.
	Sarah sits up, recognizes her father's voice.
	
	                     SARAH (O.S.)
	          DADDY!
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris is SHOUTING against the closed door.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          DON'T DO IT!  NO MATTER WHAT
	          HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!
	          DON'T O --
	
	He's silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs.  Raoul begins to
	beat him.
	
	Burnham stands by, powerless, horrifies, watching as Raoul
	savages Harris, who continues to call out, as long as he has
	strength, telling Meg not to open the door, no matter what.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg and Sarah SHOUT in horror, she covers her daughter's
	face, turn her away from the screen, SCREAMS in incoherent
	anger of her own.
	
	But she doesn't open the door.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Burnham SHOUTS at Raoul, pleading.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS
	          KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING
	          THIS!!
	
	But Raoul whips the gun up, into Burnham's throat, backing
	him off, shutting him up.
	
	He resumes his pounding of Harris.
	
	Burnham turns, looks up at the camera in the corner of the
	room.
	
	He can't stand it anymore.  He whips off his jacket, runs to
	the camera, and covers the lens.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	While Meg watches, the monitor that cover the master bedroom
	abruptly goes black, mercifully sparing them the sight of
	Harris's beating.
	
	She holds Sarah, who's sobbing, shaking.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Harris finally lapses into unconsciousness.  Raoul stands
	over him, chest heaving.
	
	Burnham stand in the doorway, neither in nor out of the room,
	a silhouette, head hung.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg tries desperately to see something on the bedroom
	monitor, but it's hopeless, it's covered.  On the hallway
	monitor, she can just see shadows, as two men in the bedroom
	lift a third off the floor and carry him across the room.
	
	A sudden BEEPING sound tears her attention away.  Still
	holding Sarah, she pulls her back, off her shoulder.  Her
	face is completely white, her lips blue, her eyes rolled back
	into her head.  The BEEPING sound grows louder, she checks
	Sarah's wristwatch, the reading is dire:
	
	57
	
	Meg GASPS, horrifies.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh God, oh my God...
	
	Sarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of Meg's arms
	and falls back onto the floor of the panic room.  Meg clears
	everything away from her, tries to make room for her.
	
	The convulsion worsens.  Meg searches through the piles of
	supplies, comes up with a plastic-handled screwdriver.  She
	opens Sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her
	teeth.
	
	She helps Sarah ride out the convulsion.  Finally, her eyes
	roll back into her head, she slowly re-orients herself.
	Sarah reaches over, turns off her still-BEEPING
	wristwatch/monitor herself.
	
	Sarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere
	near normal.
	
	Her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow
	yellow color.  She moves her lips, Meg can't hear her, she
	bends down:
	
	                     SARAH
	          You gotta jab me, Mommy...
	
	Meg turns, looks back at the monitors.  What she sees is good
	news --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera.  Burnham
	and Raoul are gone, the only person there is HARRIS, who lies
	slumped on the far side of the bed.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room.
	
	ON THAT MONITOR,
	
	she sees Burnham and Raoul having an urgent conversation,
	Burnham sitting in a chair, Raoul pacing in front of him,
	ranting.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Meg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so
	overjoyed at this turn of events.
	
	She turns, looks back at Sarah, who is starting to tremble
	again.
	
	That does it.  Meg leaps up, hits the button that controls
	the steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost
	impossibly slowly.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg steps out of the panic room, into the master bedroom.
	She looks at Harris, on the bed.  With his back to her she
	can't even tell if he's alive or dead, but first things must
	be first, so she turns and races out of the room.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	Meg flies up the stairs, bare feet on padded carpet.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, Raoul looks up, hearing the pitter-pat of
	her feet on the stairs above.
	
	He smiles and pulls his ski mask back on, to cover his face.
	
	Coming around behind him, we see Burnham sitting in the
	chair.  Except it isn't Burnham at all, it's Harris,
	unconscious, wearing Burnham's shirt.
	
	And if Harris is the person in the chair, that means --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- the person on the bed in the bedroom is Burnham, wearing
	Harris's shirt.  His eyes pop open, he sits up, sees the wide
	open door to the panic room.
	
	INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg races into Sarah's bedroom and tears open the door of a
	mini-fridge.  Inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin
	and something called Glucogen.
	
	She grabs a bottle of Glucogen and a black leather pouch and
	takes off.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	As Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying
	sight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the
	doorway of the master bedroom.
	
	She SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,
	reaches the end, throws the door open --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is
	motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can
	already see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open
	doorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim
	"tricked you" expression.
	
	Meg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She
	claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask,
	tears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her
	from pulling it off --
	
	-- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor --
	
	-- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away
	from them.
	
	Raoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the
	floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his
	face.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster,
	she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood
	toward it.
	
	Raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints
	for the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the
	medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room,
	where Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
	controls the steel door.
	
	She makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic
	bottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the
	gap just before --
	
	-- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous
	ferocity.
	
	And then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the
	door.
	
	She stands back, chest heaving, sobbing.
	
	A looooong moment goes by.
	
	Finally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	               (calmly)
	          If you leave the house, we'll kill
	          her.
	
	Meg sobs.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          If I see a uniform in the house,
	          we'll kill her.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh... oh...
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You understand?
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom.  She nods,
	terrified.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham pushes past Raoul, at the speaker button, and leans
	forward.  He's approaching exhaustion.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	               (into speaker)
	          I just... I just need forty-five
	          minutes.
	
	Raoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera,
	SCREAMING something up at it, the same thing, over and over.
	But in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through
	the walls isn't enough to be heard.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Shut up.
	
	IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
	
	we abruptly hear her voice, full-throated.
	
	                     MEG
	               (shouting into the camera)
	          -- cine, she needs the MEDICINE!
	          GIVE HER THE --
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest,
	staring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking
	very, very sick.
	
	Burnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can
	come up with under the circumstances.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta
	          here before you know it.
	
	No response from Sarah.  Burnham cocks a head, really looking
	at her.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
	
	Burnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in
	the middle of the floor.  Over his shoulder, we can see the
	face of Meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera,
	begging them to give Sarah her medicine.
	
	Using his hand, Burnham measures six lengths in from the
	wall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet,
	looking for a seam.
	
	He finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other
	hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to
	turn a corner.  He stands, hovering over the carpet, and
	pulls back evenly with both hands.
	
	The concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft
	sound of tearing VELCRO.  Underneath the flap --
	
	-- is the smooth metal door of a floor safe.
	
	Burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove.  It rolls
	out and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of
	safecracking tools.
	
	He begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a
	POUNDING on the metal door.  He turns, annoyed.  Meg is still
	SCREAMING outside the door.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          The hell does she want?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't know, she keeps screamin'
	          the same thing over and over.
	
	Burnham turns, looks at the monitors.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving
	herself an injection in the arm.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul laughs.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the
	          fuck?
	
	But Burnham thinks.  His eyes fall on the bottle and the
	leather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to
	Sarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor.  Her
	lips are moving.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Oh, man...
	
	He crawls over to Sarah, puts his ear down next to Sarah's
	lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          What is it?
	
	Sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak, but her
	breath comes hard.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I need...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah?
	
	                     SARAH
	          ... 'jection...
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          An injection?
	
	Sarah nods.  Burnham points to the pouch and the Glucogen, on
	the floor nearby.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That stuff?
	
	Sarah nods again.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Can you do it yourself?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Well, I don't know how.
	
	Sarah looks at him, eyes pleading.  Raoul stands behind
	Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          I don't fucking believe this.
	               (to Sarah)
	          You gotta wait.
	
	Sarah just looks at Burnham.  Please.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a
	          little more, and your mom'll give it
	          to you.  You can wait a half hour,
	          can't you?
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's
	          just like, tired, she's gotta rest.
	          You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
	
	Sarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Come on.
	
	He starts to pull Burnham away, but Burnham shakes his hand
	off, violently.  He bends down very close to Sarah's lips.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Tell me the truth, okay?  What's
	          gonna happen if you don't get this?
	
	Sarah swallows, licks her cracking lips.  When she speaks,
	it's breathy, almost inaudible.
	
	But the words are clear.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Coma.  Die.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Seen from overhead, Meg paces in the master bedroom, out of
	her mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people
	in the room the desperate situation.
	
	Suddenly, a VOICE comes over the intercom speaker.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          I understand.  I'll give her the
	          shot.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	A HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and
	the leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.
	Raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You're wasting your fucking time,
	          man, you're wasting my time.  You
	          don't know how to do this, and the
	          longer we stay in here, the more
	          likely she's gonna lose it and call
	          the cops!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Are you gonna open the safe?
	
	Raoul looks at him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Then shut up and get out of my way.
	
	As Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with
	Sarah, who is staring at him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Don't look at me.
	
	ACROSS THE ROOM,
	
	Burnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the
	pouch.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay, kid, all I know about this is
	          what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk
	          me through it.
	
	Sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham
	swallows.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV
	          don't lie, right?
	
	He reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,
	and a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,
	stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You seem like a good kid.  Your
	          mom... only saw her for a second,
	          but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?
	
	No answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's
	arm, pulls it tight.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey, nod or something, show me
	          you're still alive, will ya?
	
	Sarah nods.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Attagirl.  That too tight?
	
	Sarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts
	to fill it from the Glucogen bottle.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          You guys are pretty rich, huh?
	
	Sarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of
	finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he
	goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Yeah, you don't think about that
	          stuff.  Good for you.
	
	He looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about
	him.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I know, I know.  I really screwed
	          the pooch this time.  I never did
	          anything like this before.  Break
	          into somebody's house?  Not even
	          close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to
	          God, I been on the wrong end of
	          maybe six straight years of bad
	          cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.
	               (snaps his fingers --
	                gone)
	          Those are some seriously bad cards.
	          And still, every time I pick up a
	          fresh hand I swear to God, the rush
	          comes so hot and prickly I feel it
	          right down to my toes because this
	          time, this one time, it might be
	          there, this time it might be that
	          hand, that perfect hand, that
	          monster hand.
	               (shakes his head)
	          And you thought you were sick.
	
	The shot successfully given, he pulls Sarah's sleeve back
	down.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Feel better?
	
	Sarah nods, and she seems better already.  Burnham helps her
	to sit up, to lean against the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Woulda been a hell of a dad.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	A VOICE comes over the intercom in the master bedroom.  It's
	Raoul.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          She's okay.  Now sit down and wait.
	
	He CLICKS off.
	
	Meg is hugely relieved.  And extremely pissed off.  She goes
	to the corner of the room and picks up the gun, the one that
	Raoul dropped.
	
	She heads downstairs.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sparks fly as Burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a
	small, specialized drill.
	
	Raoul bends down next to him.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Congratulations.  You saved her life
	          for ten minutes.
	
	Burnham looks up at him -- what?  But Raoul turns and walks
	away.
	
	Burnham goes back to work.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg is in the living room, with Harris, who is still slouched
	in the chair.  He's in awful shape, barely conscious.
	
	Out of the silence, a sudden, deafening sound.
	
	The DOORBELL.
	
	Her eyes go wide.  She darts a look over to the door (the one
	that leads to the stoop, not the bloody kitchen door
	downstairs), then back at Harris.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          Police.
	
	                     MEG
	               (gasps)
	          You called the police?
	
	He nods.
	
	                     HARRIS
	          You... scared...
	
	Shit.  This is exactly what she prayed for him to do, now
	it's the worst thing that could happen.
	
	She stands, thinking, desperate.  She walks toward the door,
	stops, thinks some more.
	
	The doorbell RINGS again.
	
	She comes up with a plan.  She goes back to where Harris is
	in the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of
	the door.  She puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it
	to steady it.
	
	She leans down, WHISPERS to him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Don't.  Say.  A word.
	
	He nods.
	
	Meg takes a breath, walks across the foyer, tousling her hair
	as she goes.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul is staring at the monitors, aghast.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Holy shit... holy shit...
	
	Burnham races over, looks over his shoulder.  One monitor
	covers the front stoop, and on that monitor they can clearly
	see TWO UNIFORMED COPS.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the
	          kid!  She just killed her own kid!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          It's not her fault, it's not her
	          fault, the guy must have called
	          them.  Look, look, look, she's
	          telling us.
	
	He points to another monitor, the one in the foyer, where Meg
	is looking up at the camera, miming to them -- don't worry,
	I'll take care of this.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's gonna handle it.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She better.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Meg's shaking hand rises up to the doorknob and pulls open
	the big front door.  On the stoop, the two Cops turn to look
	at her.  She acts as if she's just been awakened.  She looks
	it, too, still in T-shirt and boxer shorts.  The wind is
	gusty and cold outside.
	
	                     MEG
	          Yeah?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Everything okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you all right?
	
	                     MEG
	          What are you guys -- what time is
	          it?
	
	                     COP 1
	          'Bout four o'clock.
	
	                     MEG
	          I don't get it.
	
	                     COP 2
	          We got a call...
	
	Cop 1 looks at him.  Cop 2 stops talking.
	
	                     MEG
	          Somebody called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          What do you want?
	
	                     COP 1
	          We'd like to come in.
	
	                     MEG
	          No, you can't come in.
	
	                     COP 2
	          Are you okay?
	
	                     MEG
	          I'm fine.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Can we come in?
	
	                     MEG
	          Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who
	          called you?
	
	                     COP 1
	          You don't look so good.
	
	                     MEG
	          You wake me out of a sound sleep at
	          four in the morning and then tell me
	          I look like hell?  Of course I look
	          like hell, you don't look so hot
	          yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here,
	          thank you for checking, can I go?
	
	Cop 1 studies her, notices the burned sleeve of her T-shirt,
	the black smudges still on her face.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Your husband says you said "There
	          are three..." right before you got
	          cut off.
	
	                     MEG
	          Oh, that phone call...
	
	Cop 1 takes a step forward and lowers his voice to just above
	a whisper, unconsciously making her lean forward in order to
	hear him.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Ma'am, if there's something you want
	          to say to us right now that maybe
	          you can't say to us right now, maybe
	          you just want to make a signal, by
	          blinking a few times, something like
	          that.
	
	She just looks at him.  Wow, this guy's intuitive.  She is
	sorely tempted.  But she can't.
	
	                     COP 1
	          That's something you could do.
	          Safely.
	
	She thinks, thinks --
	
	-- and burst out laughing.
	
	                     MEG
	          Man, you are good!  You mean, like,
	          if somebody was in the house or
	          something?  That's great, they
	          really train you guys these days,
	          don't they?
	
	Cop 1 looks at her, not sure if he believes her or not.
	
	                     MEG
	          No.  I'm fine.  Cross my heart.
	
	Cop 2 turns to go, but Cop 1 lingers.
	
	                     COP 1
	          May I ask what the rest of that
	          sentence was going to be?
	
	                     MEG
	               (stalling)
	          Huh?
	
	                     COP 1
	          The sentence that started "There are
	          three."  What was the rest?
	
	Pause.  She stares at him.
	
	                     MEG
	          Okay, look.  My husband and I just
	          broke up.  It's my first night in
	          the new house, and I was feeling a
	          little lonely and a little drunk.
	          The sentence, if you insist on
	          knowing, was going to be "There are
	          three things I'll do for you if you
	          come over right now and get in bed
	          with me."
	
	Cop 2 stifles a laugh.
	
	                     MEG
	          But thank God I came to my senses
	          before I said all that and hung up
	          instead, so nobody would ever know
	          what I was thinking, unless, of
	          course, two policemen showed up in
	          the middle of the night to
	          interrogate me about it.
	
	That was good.  Cop 1 is embarrassed.  Cop 2 thinks it's
	funny.
	
	                     COP 2
	          You want her to show you which three
	          things, Rick, or should we just go?
	
	Cop 1 looks at Meg, a long look, he holds it for one last
	moment, trying to read her mind.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see the video image of the Cops as they turn and head away
	down the front steps.  Meg closes the doors, looks up into a
	camera, right at us.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham and Raoul breathe a sigh of relief.
	
	Burnham goes back to work on the safe.  He's making progress.
	
	Raoul looks at Sarah.  Stares actually.  He's thinking too.
	
	Bad thoughts.  He moves over, crouches down next to Burnham.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          She saw my face.  The kid too.
	
	Sarah overhears that.  She raises her head, alarmed.  Burnham
	turns, looks over at her, and she just gets her head back
	down in time.  Burnham and Raoul close themselves off, for a
	private conversation.
	
	Sarah edges closer.  She overhears a fragment.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          That's your problem.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          That's their problem.
	
	Sarah is terrified.  Doesn't know what to do.  She looks to
	her immediate left, sees the intercom panel.  She edges
	closer.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Let me fucking finish this so we can
	          get out of here.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You finish.  Then we finish.
	
	Sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button -- "ALL PAGE."
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the living room, there is an audible CLICK as the speaker
	is activated.  Meg looks up, hears Burnham's voice, in the
	middle of a sentence.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          -- posed to mean?
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          You're here with me, you're already
	          on the hook for one.  Buy one, you
	          get the rest for the same price.
	          You know that.
	
	                     BURNHAM (O.S.)
	          Get the fuck away from me.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          The kid in here.  The other two when
	          we come out.
	
	Meg listens, horrified.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Sarah holds the intercom button down with a trembling finger.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Bullshit.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          You know how this gotta end.
	
	INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Meg stares, in shock, as Raoul's voice echoes in the empty
	room.
	
	                     RAOUL (O.S.)
	          They stay in the house.
	
	There in an abrupt CLICK, and the speaker turns off.  Meg
	turns, goes to Harris, falls to her knees, no idea what to
	do.  She holds him close, their foreheads touching.  She's
	terrified, exhausted, wants to collapse in his arms.
	
	Instead, she starts to pull the gun from his fingers.  He
	tightens his grip, what are you doing?  He tries to hold onto
	the gun, but she pulls his fingers off it, takes it away from
	him.  He is too weak to resist.
	
	                                                  CUT TO:
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the panic room, Sarah has her hands clamped over her ears,
	her mouth is wide open, and a hideous METAL SHRIEK seems to
	be coming out of it.
	
	But the SHRIEK is actually coming from the safe, where
	Burnham continues to work, another drill, a bigger bit.  The
	noise is deafening.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Sarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom,
	carrying a jacket.  Meg tosses the jacket, this time she
	doesn't want them to see what she's doing.
	
	The monitor goes black.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	In the master bedroom, Meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are
	hanging over a chair.
	
	She steps into a pair of boots.
	
	She shoves the gun into her belt.
	
	Here in the bedroom, she can hear the drill.  From the house
	next door, she hears POUNDING again, more MUFFLED CURSES.
	Apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too.
	
	Meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the
	panic room.  Her eyes light up with an idea.
	
	She goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her
	back against the exterior wall (street side), with her left
	shoulder against the common wall that's shared with the
	neighbor's brownstone.
	
	She begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring
	with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the
	entrance to the panic room.
	
	                     MEG
	          Fourteen.
	
	She hurries out of the bedroom.  What's she doing?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a
	library.  There is a window that looks out over the sidewalk,
	one floor up, same level as the stoop.
	
	She looks up, into the corners of the room.
	
	                     MEG
	          No camera, no camera, no camera...
	
	They're bare, no video cameras.  Good.
	
	She goes to the window, tries to open it.  Screwed shut, of
	course.
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The safe is almost cracked.  Raoul is watching the monitors
	carefully.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living
	room, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Raoul furrows his brow.  Now what?
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.
	She gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.
	
	The wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.
	
	She leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is
	empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the
	house).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's
	front stoop.
	
	She tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up
	onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.
	
	We lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops
	down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --
	
	-- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly
	standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was
	specifically told not to go.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to
	be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to
	turn around, to look at the monitors again --
	
	-- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          Hey!
	
	He turns, away from the monitors.
	
	                     SARAH
	          Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.
	
	Raoul scowls at her.  Behind him --
	
	ON THE MONITORS,
	
	Meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on
	the monitor.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Sarah sees her mother go.
	
	                     SARAH
	               (to Raoul)
	          Won't happen again.
	
	INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
	
	Still leaning out the window, we can see Meg from here as she
	reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the
	neighbor's house, which is contiguous.
	
	Straining to see (yet stay in the house), we see Meg all the
	way at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to
	the back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door,
	sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg.
	
	After a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open.
	The conversation begins.  The wind is gusting right in our
	faces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear --
	let me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions.
	
	The NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like
	an old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy.
	
	Losing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way
	and shoves into the house.  The Neighbor stumbles out onto
	her front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a
	nightgown, but she's no shrinking violet.  In fact, she's
	royally pissed off and not at all intimidated.
	
	                     NEIGHBOR
	          What the hell do you think you're
	          doing, young lady?!
	
	She storms back into her house, following Meg.  As both of
	them disappear from the frame, we move out of the library,
	into the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one
	shared with the neighbor's brownstone.
	
	From the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices,
	arguing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other.
	
	We drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of
	footsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them,
	from inside this house.  We pass right through the floor --
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and
	now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
	wall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's
	firm, urgent declarations.
	
	We move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what
	she's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side
	of the wall.  We drift down that wall, fourteen steps, until
	we reach the metal door to the panic room, then we pass
	through that door --
	
	INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
	
	-- and arrive inside the panic room, where Burnham is this
	close to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden --
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	Burnham and Raoul freeze, alarmed.  It's coming from the long
	wall, the shared wall.
	
	They look at each other.
	
	WHOMP.
	
	CRUNCH.
	
	They look at the wall.
	
	Somebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          The walls are steel, right?
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Not that one.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          NOT THAT ONE?!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,
	          who breaks in through the neighbor's
	          house?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	Louder.  Closer.  Burnham turns, SCREAMS at the wall.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE
	          NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
	
	                     RAOUL
	          We've got the Kid!
	               (shouting at the wall)
	          WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck
	          is she thinking?!
	
	WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          She's got your gun, that's what
	          she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to
	          bring a gun for?!
	
	Burnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work
	on the safe.  Fires up the drill again, it SCREAMS into the
	metal.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Almost there...
	
	The POUNDING keeps up from next door.  We hear sheetrock torn
	away on the far side.  Bricks, SCRAPING out of place.
	
	Sarah, in the corner, is energized, excited.  While Burnham
	and Raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms
	the three syringes that are left in there.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          ALMOST THERE...
	
	Finally, the door to the safe CRUNCHES in on one side,
	yielding to the drilling --
	
	-- at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer CRASHES
	through the wall of the panic room.  Raoul grabs hold of
	Sarah, Burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe,
	revealing --
	
	-- nothing.
	
	CRUNCH!
	
	The sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about
	a foot across.  Light spills through from the other side, as
	well as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.
	
	Raoul hurls Sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the
	side of the hole, and waits, poised above it.
	
	At the safe, Burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a
	false bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope.
	
	He snatches it up, RIPS it open, and his eyes dance as he
	holds up fourteen individual one million dollar U,S, Treasury
	Bearer Bonds.  He fans them out, eyes drinking from his
	Grail.
	
	BANG!
	
	A gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it
	aflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little
	cloud of plaster dust.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          JESUS!
	
	He whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall,
	gun extended.
	
	But Raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has
	his boot raised, over the hand.  He brings it down, a
	CRUNCHING blow that stomps right on Meg's wrist.
	
	Meg SCREAMS, loses her grip on the gun, and it CLATTERS into
	the space between the houses.
	
	BETWEEN THE WALLS,
	
	the gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls,
	where no one can get to it.
	
	IN THE PANIC ROOM,
	
	Burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!
	
	Raoul grabs Sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open
	the door.
	
	Behind them, Meg SCREAMS in anger and wriggles through the
	opening.  Before she's even all the way through, she gets
	hold of Raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room,
	scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too-small
	hole.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!
	
	But Raoul is deep in a violent rage.  Still holding Sarah
	with one hand, he bends down, grabs Meg by the hair, and
	drags her toward the doorway.
	
	                     RAOUL
	          YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
	
	He bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is
	just finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling
	in the wall.
	
	Raoul drag Meg across the floor by the hair, right into the
	track of the open steel door.
	
	She looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head,
	and  realizes with horror what his intention is.
	
	Still with one arm holding Sarah, who is kicking and
	struggling viciously, Raoul holds Meg's head down on the
	floor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
	closing.  He reaches for the "close" button.
	
	Sarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs
	them into Raoul's neck.  Raoul SCREAMS in pain.
	
	Meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.
	
	INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
	
	On the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching
	with indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above
	him.
	
	He runs down three steps.
	
	Stops again.
	
	Runs down the rest of the stairs.
	
	INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door,
	but he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam
	with one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the
	same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.
	
	Finally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.
	
	Looking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.
	
	Raoul jabs the button --
	
	-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one
	at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is
	broken, the door will not close.
	
	Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah
	flying across the room.
	
	Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the
	beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over
	again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then
	breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.
	
	But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it
	up, her head trembles --
	
	-- and collapses onto the floor.
	
	The beam completes --
	
	-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --
	
	-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He
	reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but
	Raoul loses his balance, falls forward --
	
	-- into the gap --
	
	-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door
	that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.
	
	Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on
	tight.
	
	The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.
	Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.
	
	Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.
	
	They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face
	contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.
	
	She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.
	
	He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.
	
	INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	Burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,
	throws it open --
	
	-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He
	blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that
	gun.
	
	It's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and
	was so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood
	smeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to
	know his suspicions were correct.
	
	                     COP 1
	          Put your hands up.
	
	Burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves
	blow into the house, a real gale outside.
	
	From behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a
	half dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in
	the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the
	ROARING wind.
	
	Burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the
	Cop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but
	doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS
	CRACK through the door behind him.
	
	Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
	door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks
	of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his
	chest, a triangle pattern.
	
	Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his
	jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.
	
	He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like
	playing cards.
	
	                     BURNHAM
	          Monster hand.
	
	Behind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS
	appear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the
	bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of
	poker.
	
	He GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,
	twisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the
	foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the
	bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,
	as if they were never meant to leave.
	
	Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the
	ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,
	suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over
	his head as he dies.
	
	                                             DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
	
	The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
	air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float
	down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
	saw in Meg's hallucination.
	
	But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
	throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
	nothing.
	
	The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
	out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
	to the ads.
	
	Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
	at the clouds.
	
	Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.
	
	                     SARAH
	          I mean, uptown is close to Dad's
	          place, but somebody at school said
	          the Village is really cool, so... I
	          don't know, it's so great to be
	          close to the park and everything...
	          What do you think, I mean, give me a
	          clue, here, where are we gonna live?
	
	Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems
	years younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
	daughter's hair behind one ear.
	
	She smiles.  She is calm.
	
	Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
	clear autumn sky.
	
	                                                FADE OUT.

    to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open.    They
    look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed.
    CLOSEUP - MAN

    the owner of the eyes. Though we only see from his shoulders
    to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field.
    His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears
    to be resting comfortably. MUFFLED VOICES and WHISPERS fill
    the air but they seem to come from another place. The man
    doesn't notice them. His name is BUTCH.
    A gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw
    wipes across his forehead. Then, oddly enough, it is followed
    by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters
    across his face. It is followed by another and another, a
    five, a ten, a single. Butch pays no attention. He's in
    another world.

    SUPERSCRIPT:    OCTOBER, 1963.
    A small country town. Normally quiet at this hour, the
    street is tonight alive with trick or treaters dressed as
    witches, goblins and superheroes making their annual door to
    door rounds.
3   EXT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     3
    GLADYS PERRY, 30 going on 45 due to single motherhood and
    having worked two fulltime minimum wage jobs the past ten
    years, looks out the window with disgust and pulls the
    curtains closed.
4   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     4
    Gladys retreats   from the sparsly decorated living room to the
    predictably drab   linoleum kitchen. At the table, hands on
    their laps, sit   her children, NAOMI and RUTH, twin girls aged
    10, and PHILLIP,   a quiet boy of 8.

    Gladys sets a casserole on the table and goes to the frig for
    a container of milk. The children WHISPER to one another...
                              NAOMI
             Judy Baumer is going as a twirler.
                                 RUTH
             But she's so fat.     I'd go as Cinderella...
             or Peter Pan.
                              NAOMI
             Peter Pan's a boy. Tinker Bell's a girl.
             Phillip could go as Peter Pan... 'cept
             you gotta' fly.

    Phillip smiles a bit at the notion.
                              RUTH
             Phillip could go as a bump on a log.
    The girls giggle and Phillip frowns.
                              PHILLIP
             Why can't we go just once?
                              NAOMI
             Caus' we jus' can't, ok?
    Gladys sets milk and butter on the table and stares directly
    at her son.
                               GLADYS
             Our personal beliefs lift us to a higher
             place. 'Sides, Halloween is nothing but
             the Devil's work.

    The DOORBELL RINGS.   The kids gulp as Gladys turns and heads
    for the door.
5   EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                                       5
    MR. HUGHES, a 35-year-old family man is playing chaperone to
    prepubescent versions of SUPERMAN, TINKERBELL, and a DANCING
    SKELETON.
                               KIDS
                     (in unison)
             Trick or treat!!!
    Gladys simply stares at the children before looking to Mr.
    Hughes.
                              GLADYS
             I'm sorry but we don't take no part in
             Halloween.

             Excuse me?
    Phillip arrives at his mother's apron. He stares at the kids
    with relish. In the near window, Ruth and Naomi steal a look
    through the window.
                              GLADYS
             We're Jehovah's Witness.
    Superman locks eyes with Phillip.
                              SUPERMAN

                              GLADYS
             Go eat your supper, Phillip.
                             MR. HUGHES
             Come on, kids. Let's go to the next
             house. Sorry for the bother.
    Gladys closes the door firmly and locks it.
6   EXT. HUNTSVILLE STATE PRISON - NIGHT                        6
    A green Impala pulls up to the main entrance and stops. A
    GUARD steps from his office to greet the driver, LARRY, a
    pudgy 55-year-old prison employee wearing a loud plaid jacket.

                               GUARD
             Evenin', Larry.   Forget somethin'?
                              LARRY
             Goin' to Austin tomorrow.      Gonna' take
             some work with me.
                              GUARD
             Work, work, work. When you and me gonna'
             go out and grab a cold one?
                              LARRY
             Sooner the better.
    The gate opens and the Impala passes.

                                                              4.
7   INT. CELL - NIGHT                                         7
    BUTCH HAYNES, a 38-year-old inmate who reeks with knowledge
    procured from the wrong side of the tracks, but whose sad,
    tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret, stands on the top of a
    cell bunk chipping at the ceiling.
    JERRY PUGH, 29, rail thin, a punk who constantly licks his
    lips, keeps watch at the door. An OLD TIMER sits on his bunk
    and watches both with a cautious eye.
    Butch chips through to something.
                              BUTCH
             Damn if the old man ain't right.
    Jerry smiles, turns and grabs the old man by the shirt.

                              JERRY
             And this goes to the roof?
                              OLD TIMER
             Used to... afore they walled it over.
                              JERRY
             If it don't I'm gonna' rip your tongue out.
                              OLD TIMER
             Get yer' damn hands off me!
    Jerry laughs and joins Butch, who is already well on his way
    to bending open a slot in a corrugated metal air shaft hidden
    behind the wall.
8   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                      8
    Superman and Dancing Skeleton, no longer with adult super-
    vision, fill water balloons at an outdoor water spigot.

                              SUPERMAN
             Make 'em small so you can heave 'em.
9   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                       9
    An assembly line at the kitchen sink as the twins wash and
    Phillip dries the evening dishes. Gladys sits at the kitchen
    table, reading religious pamphlets and keeping a watchful eye
    over the process.
    Several THUDS resound through the house.
                              PHYLLIS
             What in the world?
    Phillip jumps down off his stool and races into the living
    room.

                                                             5.
10    EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                          10
      Superman lofts a BALLOON and grabs another as the first hits
      the door of the Perry house and SPLATTERS.
                                  SUPERMAN
               Bombs away!
      Dancing Skeleton does his best Warren Spahn and tosses a wet
      fastball at the door.
                                SKELETON
               Here's your trick!
      At the window, Phillip, his nose pressed to the pane, stares
      expressionless at the onslaught. He barely flinches as a
      BALLOON SPLATS only inches away. Gladys arrives and pulls
      the curtains shut once more.
11A   EXT. PRISON - NIGHT                                         11A
      Butch kicks the top off a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the
      roof. Jerry follows as Butch shimmies to the wall.
      At the edge, Butch and Jerry survey the yard as a searchlight
      routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light.
11B   THEIR POV - GREEN IMPALA                                    11B
      parked almost directly below them, next to the Administration
      office of the prison.
                                JERRY
               You'n'me must be livin' right, Butchie boy!
                                BUTCH
               Let's get something straight. I don't
               like you. As soon as we're on our way,
               that's it.
                                JERRY
               Who said I liked you?
      Butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on
      the roof of the building below.
12    INT. ADMIN OFFICE - NIGHT                                   12
      A SOFT THUD causes a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as
      he spots Larry departing, files in hand, waving goodbye.
                                GUARD
               Have a safe trip now, Larry.

                                                                 6.
13    EXT. YARD - NIGHT                                          13
      Just as Larry reaches the Impala, Butch and Jerry leap down
      and land on him. The spotlight showers them in a flash of
      light as it passes by.
      Butch cups his hand over Larry's mouth while Jerry reaches
      into his jacket -- Bingo -- a shiny .38.
                                 BUTCH
                        (to Larry)
                Keep yer' mouth shut.
                                 JERRY
                        (to Larry)
                Gawd I'd love to blow yer' head off.

14    EXT. PRISON GATE - NIGHT                                        14
      Larry, driving with his eyes straight ahead, stops at the gate
      and waves a palm at the Guard, who opens without hesitation.
                                  GUARD
                'Night, Larry.
15    INT. CAR - FLOORBOARD - NIGHT                                   15
      stuffed and hidden half on the floor and half under the mats
      are Jerry and Butch.
                                  JERRY
                'Night, Larry.

16A   INT. SMALL, WELL-LIT DINER - NIGHT                              16A
      A weathered finger drops a quarter in a jukebox.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                B-5.   Haven't heard that one in awhile.
      The woman, MAE, 45, a dog-tired waitress, punches in the
      numbers and returns to her post behind the counter. A
      lonesome HANK WILLIAMS tune pours forth.
                                 MAE
                Not since last night.     How's the pie?
      RED GARNETT, 60, a grizzled but handsome Texas Ranger, sits
      at the counter slowly chewing.
                                  RED
                Kinda rubbery.   It was better yesterday.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

16A   CONTINUED:                                                     16A
                                MAE
               Same pie as yesterday. Not much call
               for rhubarb. Sell one slice a day.
      In the background we hear a SIREN. Red turns and watches a
      police patrol car whiz past, lights on.
                                MAE
               Yer off duty. Tell me, if I stopped bakin'
               'em would you still come by every night?
      Red, preoccupied, takes another rubbery bite.
                                 RED
               I don't know.

      Mae smiles and turns her back to Red as she cleans the grill.
                                MAE
               Naw, Red Garnett, you don't come in here
               for the coffee and pie. You come in here
               for the company. To see me.
      Another patrol car races past.   Red's eyes follow it.

16B   ANGLE ON MAE                                                   16B
                                MAE
               Now that I've said that, I'll go   one better.
               What say I cook you dinner at my   place
               sometime? Steaks, baked taters,    cold beer,
               the works. Well?... I'm askin'    you out.
      She turns to face Red but he's gone. A coupla dollars lie
      next to the half-eaten pie. All she can do is sigh.


16C   INT./EXT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT                                   16C
      Red pulls up in front of a small house in a residential
      section of town. Police cars are everywhere and several
      officers are behind their vehicles, guns pointed at the house.
      Red steps out of the car and is greeted by a POLICE SERGEANT,
      about the same age as Red.
                                SERGEANT
               Long time, no see. What are you doin'
               here, Chief?
                                 RED
               Couldn't sleep.   Whattaya got?
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              8.
16C   CONTINUED:                                                    16C
      They walk. Red arrives at a truck with a 10 gallon coffee
      urn roped to the tailgate. He grabs a paper cup and pours.
                                SERGEANT
               Guy holdin' his family hostage. She kicked
               him out, served him divorce papers, he came
               back drunk and pulled a .38. Fired two shots
               but we don't think anybody's hit. Actually
               you might know the guy from your sheriff
               days. Hayden Webb. Been on suspension for
               awhile. Ring any bells?
                                 RED
               Yeah.   Lemme talk to him.

                                 SERGEANT
               No can do.   Police jurisdiction.
      Red tastes the coffee -- cold. He spits it out, pours the
      contents of the cup on the ground and walks toward the front
      yard. Sergeant follows.
                                RED
               And how are you guys doin'?
                                SERGEANT
               We got specific rules to follow in these
               kinda situations, Red.
                       (gives in)
               He won't talk. Jus' keeps yellin', crying
               and waving his gun around.
      Red moves forward into the yard.
                                SERGEANT
               At least use the megaphone, you stubborn
               jackass!
      But Red ignores and arrives at the front door.   He knocks.
                                RED
               Hayden, this is Red Garnett. We worked together
               a few years back. Mind if I come in?
      The YELLING inside STOPS and the door opens a crack.   HAYDEN,
      35, distraught, peers out.
                                  HAYDEN
               'Evenin', Chief.
                                RED
               Leave it to the P.D. They got a three-
               ring circus out there and not one cup
               of hot coffee. You mind?
      Hayden mulls it over, then opens the door.

                                                                9.
16D   INT. WEBB HOUSE - NIGHT                                        16D
      On the couch sits Hayden's wife, JULIE, cradling her two kids,
      an infant and an 8-year-old boy. Julie sobs. Her eye and
      temple are bruised purple.
      Red slowly enters, nods to Julie, takes off his hat and sets
      it on a lampstand. Hayden has moved away from Red against
      the wall. He holds the gun out at no one in particular.
                                HAYDEN
               Julie, put a pot of coffee on.
      She slowly gets up and moves to the kitchen, still weeping.
                                 RED
               Appreciate it.   Jus' what is it you want,
               Hayden?
                                HAYDEN
               I dunno... I want my job.    I want my family.
                                RED
               What'd they suspend you for?
                                HAYDEN
               I answer a call in South Austin. Girl
               gettin' raped, that's the word. I bust
               in the door, this lowlife is beatin' the
               shit outta her with a tire iron. 'Help me,
               help me,' she says. I take the guy down.
               He bites me. I break his arm. Case closed,
               right? No. She was his wife and they both
               sue me and the department. The guy's about
               to kill her and she sues me 'cause now he
               can't pump gas. They have chump change in
               the bank but they got the best lawyer in
               town. Three months I'm goin' crazy. No
               pay. Then my wife leaves me and I get
               served divorce papers by John Reese -- a
               sheriff's man. You know how embarrassin'
               that is? What's happenin', Chief? I
               mean, everybody's got a fuckin' lawyer!
      Julie emerges from the kitchen and retakes her seat.
                                  RED
               You love her?    Love the kids?
                                  HAYDEN
               Yeah.
                                JULIE
               Then why do you hit me!
      Hayden grips the quivering revolver tight and points it
      at her. Red calms the situation...

               You don't wanna shoot her.

               I swear to God I think I do.
                                RED
               Naw, Hayden, I don't     think so. I think you
               love her. You know      what else I think? That
               you'd like a way out     of this whole mess...
               That's where I come     in.
16E   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                                16E
      Sergeant and other cops stand around and watch the house.

               Well, I'll be damned.
      NEW ANGLE
      The front door opens and Julie emerges with her two kids.
      She takes a few cautious steps, then runs to the police.
16F   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                                16F
      Red sits on the coffee table, unloading Hayden's gun.       He
      opens the cylinder and drops the shells to the floor.
      A calmer Hayden exits the kitchen with Red's coffee.       Red
      accepts it, takes a sip.
                                    RED
               Hits the spot.
      Hayden starts to sob a bit.      Red hands over a handkerchief
      which Hayden accepts.
                                HAYDEN
               No cuffs, huh, Chief?
                                    RED
               Okay.   You ready?
      Hayden nods, they stand. Red picks up his hat, sticks it
      on his head, opens the door and holds it for...
      Hayden, transfixed by the multitude of lights outside.      He
      gulps.
                                RED
               We'll walk out together, okay?
      Hayden steps back, looks at Red, then reaches behind his
      back, underneath his shirt and pulls out a .22 pistol.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                11.

                                HAYDEN
               Any good officer has a back-up.
      Red holds his palms out and takes a step toward Hayden.
                                RED
               Lemme have it, Hayden.
      Hayden points the gun at Red, freezing him.
                                HAYDEN
               Was I a good officer, Chief?
      Red nods.

                                HAYDEN
               Was I a good deputy? The kinda man you
               could depend on to do what's right?
                                   RED
               Yeah.
      Hayden smiles.
                                   HAYDEN
               Thank you.
      Then he turns the GUN on himself, swallows the barrel and
      BLOWS his brains out.
                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
16G   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)                                16G
      Hayden's dead, covered body is carried out the door.    Julie
      screams and sobs, still holding her crying children.

      Red, looking pretty shook up, slowly exits the house. He
      stops and looks at Julie and the kids. His eyes lock with
      the little boy's.
                                COP
               Got a call, Chief Garnett.   They're
               lookin' for ya downtown.
      Red slowly walks away.   The little boy's eyes follow him.
17    INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT                                  17
      It's a small town version of a 7-11, kept open by an owner
      anxious to cash in on the later night munchies of beer
      drinkers. Good idea. Bad luck.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

17   CONTINUED:                                                     17
     Jerry skims through a girly magazine, turning the pages with
     the gun.
     Butch, wearing Larry's plaid jacket, jimmies open the cash
     register. He looks to the floor then to...
     Jerry, who catches Butch's gaze, holds it, looks down at the
     floor, then, smiling, looks back to Butch. He returns to
     the skin mag.
     Butch holds his stare at Jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad
     of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store.
     Jerry notices Butch leaving, grabs a handful of assorted
     Brach's candies and hurries after.

                                  JERRY
              Hey, wait up!
     Jerry's feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a
     quivering hand.
18   INT. D.P.S. - TEXAS RANGERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT               18
     It's very late, after midnight, and only a handful of people,
     half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices.
     A light from an office at the end of the hall catches our
     eye. A MUFFLED  VOICE over the phone...
                               RED (V.O.)
              I understan' your concern, Johnny.
19   INT. RED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                      19
     Red, behind a huge    ranchstyle desk covered with files and
     paper, sips coffee    with one hand, works a buffalo nickel
     through magician's    paces with the other and balances the
     phone receiver in    the crook of his neck.
                               RED
                      (on phone)
              Cons are creatures o' habit. Like old
              coyotes, they'll crawl back into familiar
              holes. Uh huh... Yeah... Sure yer' right.
              Listen you go back to bed and I'll call you
              in the A.M. with an update. I'll have the
              files by then. Say hullo to the Mrs..
     Red sighs, puts the PHONE back in the hook and stares at
     it until it RINGS again.
20   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT (JUST BEFORE DAWN)                    20
     The CLANGING wind up alarm CLOCK reads 5:30 and Gladys opens
     her eyes and gently quiets it with a touch. She groans and
     rises, not happy but used to the daily ritual required of her.

                                                              13.
21   INT. PERRY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                 21
     As the kitchen light comes on we see that the couch has been
     opened up to a bed in which all three children sleep. The
     twins sleep soundly but Phillip tosses and turns away from
     the light.
22   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                      22
     The Impala creeps through the previously seen neighborhood
     without its lights.
23   INT. IMPALA - NIGHT                                            23
     Butch drives while Jerry scours the block.
                                  JERRY
              There's a Buick.
                               BUTCH
              Don't want a Buick. Want a Ford.
                                  JERRY
              Ford's leak oil.     A car's a car.
     Butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop.
                               BUTCH
              Then take the Buick.
                               JERRY
              Soon as we cross state line I'll do just
              that.
                      (beat)
              I'm tired of riding around. I'll check
              down the block... for a Ford!
     Jerry gets out, slams the door, lights a cigarette and walks
     away.
     Butch waits a few seconds, quietly turns the key one notch
     and checks the gas ggauge. It reads almost empty. He taps
     it with his finger but it doesn't budge. He sighs, looks up
     and sees...
     JERRY
     as he checks one locked car, then feeling eyes on his back,
     turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a corner.
     BUTCH discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the
     door without a sound.
24   INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               24
     Gladys steps into a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs
     into a skillet. By rote she salts, stirs, and pops bread into
     the toaster.

                                                             14.
25    EXT. PERRY BACKYARD - SOMEONE'S POV - NIGHT                  25
      FROM BEHIND a fence, THROUGH the opened, screened windows we
      see Gladys at work.
      Phillip enters, dressed in cotton briefs and a T-shirt, drags
      a chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his
      mother by buttering the toast.
      POV MOVES CLOSER.
                                GLADYS
               Thank you, Phillip. Go wake up your
               sisters.
      Phillip dutifully steps down and returns to the living room.
      Gladys works to adjust her slip, then grabs plates and
      silverware and takes them to the table.

                                JERRY
               I take mine fried.
26    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         26
      Gladys gasps at Jerry's face pressed against the screen, but
      controls herself when he brandishes the pistol. He motions
      for her to open the back door. She does. He slides into the
      room and sits down at the table.
27    EXT. ON STREET - NIGHT                                       27
      A Ford sits in a driveway. In the far b.g. a back porch light
      glares. Butch ENTERS FRAME, looks at the light, turns to the
      Ford and starts to jimmie the lock. No luck. He rises and
      looks to the light.
28    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         28
      Jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys
      and makes a motion to the counter.
                                JERRY
               A lil' on the bland side.   Gimme' that
               ketchup.
      She picks up a bottle of Heinz and inches toward him. When
      she gets close, he grabs her and forces her onto his lap. He
      holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear.
                                JERRY
               Don't got a man around here, do ya'?
29A   INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                29A
      MR. CUMMINGS, 70, puts on his glasses and peers through the
      window.

                                                               15.
29B   HIS POV - PERRY KITCHEN                                        29B
      Gladys sits on Jerry's lap, thanks to .38 caliber coercion.
      The convict's hands move freely over the frightened woman's
      body.
30    INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               30
                                JERRY
               Feed me, sweet thing.
      Her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips.    He
      licks them once then gobbles with gusto.
      Phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks.
                                JERRY
               Well lookie here, you do got a man!
      Jerry smiles at Phillip while he kisses and licks Glady's neck.
      At once, Phillip darts across the room at Jerry, who backhands
      the boy with his gunhand, sending Phillip sprawling.
      Butch blasts through the door in an instant. With a swift
      kick to the head, Jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor
      against the cabinets.
      The gun slides across the floor and lands at Phillip's feet.
                                JERRY
                       (holding his ear)
               I'm bleedin'! You happy?
      Butch gives Jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level
      with Phillip. Butch looks at the gun and then at Phillip.
                                BUTCH
               What's your name, boy?

                                  PHILLIP
                        (scared shitless)
               Ph...   Phillip...
                                BUTCH
               Well, okay Phillip. Reach down and pick
               up that pistola.
                                   JERRY
               Give it to me.
                                BUTCH
                       (to Jerry)
               Shut yer' mouth.
                       (to Phillip)
               Pick it up and bring it over here.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             16.

     Phillip reaches down and slowly picks up the gun by the handle.
     He takes one step toward Butch, then another. Gladys,
     petrified, sobs.
     Phillip arrives armslength from Butch.
     CLOSEUPS - PHILLIP AND BUTCH
                               BUTCH
              Now say 'stick 'em up.'
                               PHILLIP
                      (hesitant)
              Stick 'em up...

     Butch laughs and then a NOISE from outside brings him back
     to reality. He grabs the gun and spins to see...
     MR. CUMMINGS
     Standing outside the screen door, gun leveled. Before the old
     man can utter a syllable, Butch grabs Phillip and points the
     gun straight at Cummings. Jerry jumps up and grabs Gladys.
                               BUTCH
              Put the gun down, old timer. You couldn't
              hit me anyway. Probably shoot the boy.
     The PHONE RINGS.
                               BUTCH
              Leave it be.
     The twins wiping sleep from their eyes, wander into the room.
                               NAOMI
              Mama?...
                               GLADYS
              It's all right, honey.
     PHONE continues to RING. Cummings can't decide what to do
     with the gun he's pointing at Butch.
                               JERRY
              You deaf?!!!
                               BUTCH
              Set it on the ground.
     Cummings reluctantly obeys.
                               JERRY
              We gotta' get the hell outta'here!

     PHONE still RINGS...
                                 JERRY
                Shut up!
     In one fluid move he rips the phone from the wall.    The
     silence is deafening.
                                 JERRY
                        (re: Gladys)
                I vote we bring her with us.
                                 BUTCH
                No.
                                 JERRY
                How we gonna' get outta' here without a
                hostage, tell me that? The whole goddam
                neighborhood's awake.
                                 BUTCH
                We'll take the boy.
     Silence.   Gladys can't believe her ears.   Then...
                                 GLADYS
                Nooooo!!!
     Jerry tosses Gladys aside. She collapses onto the floor.
     The TWINS instantly start to CRY.
     Phillip winds up and hits Butch as hard as he can. Butch picks
     him up, directs Cummings into the kitchen with the gun and nods
     for Jerry to lead.
                                 BUTCH
                You'll get him back. I swear it.

31   EXT. FRONT YARD - DAWN                                            31
     Butch, carrying Phillip, and Jerry emerge from the back of
     the house and race back to the Impala.
                                 GLADYS (O.S.)
                Phillip!!!!...
     Butch flips Jerry the gun, tosses Phillip into the passenger
     seat, leaps over the hood and into the driver's seat. The
     CAR STARTS and SQUEALS away.
     Neighbors, aroused by the noise, exit their homes clad in
     robes, nighties and curlers.

                                                               18.

     Jerry FIRES a SHOT over their heads, sending them to the deck
     or scurrying for safety.
                               JERRY
              Ain't you folks ever heard of sleepin'

     Cummings races from behind the house with the SHOTGUN,
     levels it and FIRES a BLAST...
     A nearby station wagon WINDOW SHATTERS. Rising from their
     cover position, its owners look at Cummings with disgust.

                               OWNER

     Garnett, still in the same clothes, rests the phone receiver
     in his ear while he shuffles through the files before him.
     Red's deputy and boy friday, TOM ADLER, 40, lank, thinning
     hair, with a face as soft as Red's is hard, warms up Red's
     coffee with a jolt from the Chief's favorite plaid Thermos.
                               RED
                      (into phone)
              Yes, Johnny, I do understand that...
     The jabbering on the other end of the phone line continues
     as Red's eyes squint to read the files.
     INSERT - FILES
     The first is Jerry's, complete with a grinning mug shot in the
     upper right hand corner. There are several pages in the file,
     but Red's fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet before
     turning to...
     INSERT - SECOND FILE
     It's Butch's and again Red's fingers start to move down the
     page then they stop and move to the photo of Butch at the top
     of the page.
     RED'S FACE
     A hint of recognition.    The jabbering continues...
     CLOSEUP - PHOTO OF BUTCH
     A little younger than now.    A younger con with the grim facade
     of a man facing hard time.

     RED
     keeps staring at the photo, oblivious to the phone conversa-
     tion he's "not having".
                                  PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
              Red?     Red, you there?

              He's talkin' to ya'.
                               PHONE VOICE (V.O.)
              Have you heard a word I've said?!
     Red comes to...

              Yeah, Johnny. Jus' thinkin' is all....
                               ADLER
                      (another whisper)
              Press has been waiting almost an hour, Red.
     Red nods then notices someone at the door and motions her
     in... SALLY GERBER, 28, cute in a plain, no nonsense way,
     with giant curls accenting her round face in step with the
     latest hair fashions, enters the room, closes the door behind
     her. She's nervous as hell but trying to hide it.
     Red motions her to have a seat while he finishes his call.
                               RED
                      (into phone)
              Yeah.... Clear as a bell... Mi' sabe.
     Red hangs up the phone, takes a draw on the coffee mug and
     looks again at the file. He seems lost in time.
                                  ADLER
              What'd he say?
                                 RED

     Red closes the file.

              Reminded me it's an election year.
     Red turns his attention to Sally.

              from Huntsville. Assigned by Governor
              Connally.
     Red is confused.     He turns a blank expression to Adler.

                                 RED
              Adler...    what is this?
     Adler searches the messy desk for something.
                               ADLER
              Rings a bell, Red. Believ' they sent us
              something about her this mornin'...

     Adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands
     it to Red.

              Uh, I'm Sally Gerber. Criminologist
              with the State Prison System.
     Sally offers her hand. Red, perusing the telex, ignores but
     Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed
     to like her or not.
                                ADLER

              On our way, Marge.

     Adler hangs up the phone.
                               ADLER
              Gettin' antsy, Red. You scheduled it.
     Adler hangs up, grabs Red's tie and coat from a brass rung on
     the wall and hands them over. Red puts down the telex, stares
     at Sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable.
                               SALLY
              The idea is that an understanding of the
              particular behavioral case histories
              should, in parole situations, help the
              subject to avoid habitual traps and, in
              penal escape situations could, conversely,
              identify those self-same traps as an aide
              to apprehension.

     Adler stares at Sally then turns to Red with a "never heard
     the like" look of amazement on his face.
     Red, roguishly handsome in his tan, western cut blazer, clip
     on tie and ten gallon hat, makes his way to the door. But,
     before he exits...
                               RED
              In the first place, Miss Gerber.

                               RED
              In the first place, Sally, it ain't a
              'penal escape situation.' It's a manhunt.
              Fancy words in a circle don't help much.
                               SALLY

              inmates over to Huntsville, Robert 'Butch'
              Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through
              an air shaft, grabbed a prison employee's
              car and got out through the main gate. At
              approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed
              a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed
              the store's owner.

     warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press
     conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off
     a bit, but....

     There are no questions. In fact there is utter silence as

     parked in the middle of the lot hitched to the back of a new
     Chevy truck. The Airstream is painted in state colors and
     sports banners, decals and logos.

40   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                         40
     Saunders follows Red as he walks around the showpiece,
     occasionally kicking a tire or two.
                               SAUNDERS
              So whattaya' think?
     Saunders motions for the Photographer to come closer and take
     pictures. He moves in next to Red and poses as the camera
     clicks.
                                SAUNDERS
              We are very proud of this baby. Governor
              Connally special ordered it so state
              officials and dignitaries can ride in the
              parade in Dallas. You know President
              Kennedy's comin'?

                               RED
              So I hear.
                               SAUNDERS
              Latest technology, oversized engine,
              complete kitchen and sleeping quarters,
              gun racks, frig, stove, the works. Even
              got a hot line phone straight to the
              Governor's office.
     Red stops circling and nods to Adler, who scurries away.
                               RED
              Fine piece of machinery.

                               SAUNDERS
              What's more, as soon as it gets back from
              Dallas it will be at your requisitioned
              disposal. Perfect for lots of situations
              -- a headquarters on wheels.
     Red smiles, walks up to one of the Lone Star decals and rips
     it off.
                               RED
              We'll take it.
                               SAUNDERS
              Uh, Chief?....
     Red rips off another decal. Adler and a few others start to
     load equipment, guns and files into the motor home. In
     addition they cart out unecessary items: mattresses, etc.
     and stack them in a pile outside the motor home.
     The Photographer continues to snap photos.

                               SAUNDERS
                      (to Red)
              Whattaya' doin', Red?!
                      (to Photographer)
              Stop takin' pictures!
     Red does away with the parade banner.   Saunders follows behind
     and tries to reinstate the decal.
                               SAUNDERS
              It's jus' not possible, Red. The Governor's
              gonna' ride it in a campaign parade tomorrow.
                               RED
              Guvner' hisself told me this manhunt was
              top priority.

     Adler moves through the door to the RV carrying Red's favorite
     desk chair. He's followed by BOBBY LEE, 20's, cocksure,
     wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots.
                               ADLER
                      (to Saunders)
              S'cuse me.
                      (to Red)
              This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist
              with the Feds. They want him to tag along.
     Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods.   Bobby Lee steps
     into the Airstream.
                               SAUNDERS
              Please, Red, ya' gotta' believe me...
     Red spots Suttle, 35, bright-eyed, with a cowlick, sitting at
     the wheel of the Chevy truck.
                                RED
              Who are you?
                               SUTTLE
              Dick Suttle, the driver.
                                RED
              Not anymore.   Bradley.
     BRADLEY, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in.
     Suttle shrugs and steps out.
     Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red.
                               SAUNDERS
              This man stays with the vehicle wherever
              it goes, Red!
                               RED
                      (to Suttle)
              You know how to operate the gadgets?
                                SUTTLE
              Yessir.
                               RED
                      (to Suttle)
              Grab a seat.
     Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck.
     Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an
     armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red.
     Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              28.

                               SAUNDERS
              Please Red, I'm beggin'. I mean, what am
              I suppose to tell the Governor?
     Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word...
                               RED
              Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked
              me out on it.
     Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the
     motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger
     side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window.
                               SAUNDERS
              Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle?
              Not a scratch!
     Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally.   She's
     pissed and overloaded with files.
     AIRSTREAM
     about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop.    A second later
     the door opens and the steps pop out.
     Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door...
     ... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream.   The Airstream
     moves another 20 feet then stops.
     Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out
     of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously
     forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. Again,
     when she gets close...

     ...the Airstream moves. Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure
     wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box
     in anger.
     The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a   few AD LIBS,
     i.e. -- "Okay, Okay." More LAUGHTER. Red steps    out the door,
     turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and  comments stop
     on a dime. Smiling slightly he turns to Sally,   moves straight
     for the file box, picks it up and walks back to  the Airstream.
     When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to  Sally, who
     stews and holds her ground.
                               RED
              You comin' or not?
     She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red,
     grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him.

                                                                29.
41   OMITTED                                                          41
42   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             42
     Sally enters, balancing the   boxes, and glares at the faces
     surrounding her. A smiling    Red, a grinning Adler messily
     gorging on a cinnamon roll,   a nervous KAISER, the radio man,
     and, in the corner, a nasty   smirk from Bobby Lee.
     When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and
     drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help
     but she gives them the evil eye.
                                SALLY
               I've got it.
     She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her.     She
     looks up to the men staring at...
     Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh.
     She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll
     dangling on his chin.
                                SALLY
               You've got shit on your face.
     Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face.
43   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                            43
     The IMPALA BLASTS along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows
     as it heads into a one light township. It slows, however,
     before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay
     phone booth.

                                BUTCH
               So give him a call. See if we can shack
               there til' things cool down.
     Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe,
     grabs the keys from the ignition. Then he laughs and crawls
     out on his way to the phone booth.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

     In the b.g. we see Jerry strut to the phone booth and pore
     through a thin directory. Phillip steals a glance at Butch,
     who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth.
                               PHILLIP
              Why'd he take the keys?
                               BUTCH
              So I won't leave him.
                               PHILLIP
                      (a tad hopeful)
              Would you leave him?
                               BUTCH
              Oh yeah.
     In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and
     returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses
     the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off.
                               JERRY
              Musta' moved. Prolly' couldn't have heard
              'em anyway. Goddam ear's still bleedin'.
              You ever try that shit again...
                               BUTCH
              What?
                               JERRY
              What?
                               BUTCH
              You were in the middle of threatenin' me.
                               JERRY
                      (from the movies)
              Ain't a threat. It's a fact.
     Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the
     steering wheel.
                               BUTCH
              Here kid, take the wheel.
     Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best
     to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch
     turns back over the seat to confront Jerry.
                               BUTCH
              In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose.
              That's a threat...

     Before Jerry has time to snicker Butch hits him full in the
     face and grabs the gun. Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and
     the injured man cups his hands over the wound.
     Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip.
                               BUTCH
              ... And that's a fact.
     Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the
     seat wearing a look of pure hatred.
                               JERRY
              I'm gonna' kill you for that.

                               BUTCH
              And that's a threat. Beginnin' to
              understand the difference?
     Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and
     turns into...
45   EXT. RURAL STORE - DAY                                       45
     The Impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store,
     which is bordered by a giant hay field.
46   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                      46

              Okay, Phillip, listen up. I'm gonna'
              run in here and get some smokes.
                                  JERRY
              Get beer.

     Butch hands Phillip the revolver.
                               BUTCH
              Here, hold it like this.... And point it
              right between his eyes.
                                  JERRY
              What the hell?...

              If he so much as moves you pull the trigger
              ... right here... Put your finger on it.
     Jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally. Butch reaches
     over and cocks the pistol. Jerry's guffaws stop on a dime.
                               JERRY
              Yer' a fuckin' crazy man.

     Butch enters.   A short fat man with a fishing cap is sweeping
     up.
                                 BUTCH
              How-do.    Where's yer' sodees?

     Phillip's slightly shaking hands hold the pistol pointed
     directly at Jerry's head.
                               JERRY
              You ever shot a gun before, boy?
     No answer. Phillip steals a glance at the store, anxious for
     Butch to return.
                                 JERRY
              Powww!!!...    It'll knock you on your ass.
                                  PHILLIP
              Be quiet, mister.
                               JERRY
              Naw. You ain't never shot no gun before.
              Livin' in a house with three split tails...
              no Daddy around. You'll prolly' grow up
              queer, you know that?
     A bead of sweat rolls down Phillip's cheek.
                               JERRY
              Now I'm gonna' lean up here real slow,
              okay? So we can talk.
     Jerry raises his hands, palms up and slowly leans forward in
     the back seat. Phillip's hand quivers but he doesn't pull
     the trigger.

              There we go. Now we can have a 'man to
              man.' You are a man, ain't ya'?

                                                              33.

     Butch dumps a six pack of RC Colas, a handful of Moon Pies,
     a handful of beef jerky and some gum on the counter.
50   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                        50
     Jerry's chin is on the front seat now and his arms are draped
     over it.
                               JERRY
              Those are cute little underwears you got
              there, boy. Say does your mama sew yer'
              name in 'em, initials or anything?
     Jerry's hand slowly reaches down to the white briefs. He
     places one finger in the front elastic waistband and slowly
     pulls it open.
                               JERRY
              Whatcha' got in there?
     Jerry sneaks a peek.
                               JERRY
              Kinda' puny, ain't it?
     Phillip, diverted, looks down.    In a flash Jerry grabs the
     gun.
                               JERRY
              The hand is quicker than the eye.
     Jerry flicks open the revolver, spins it -- empty slots.
                               JERRY
                      (re: Butch)
              That sonofabitch. Hell's bells, no
              shells.
51   INT. STORE - DAY                                               51
     The Old Man puts down his broom and ambles to the register.
                               OLD MAN
              This be all for ya'?
                               BUTCH
              This and a carton of Chesterfields.
                      (beat)
              Are those .38 shells? Gimme a box.
     The Old Man puts the cigs and shells on the counter and starts
     to tally the bill on a notepad.

     Butch reaches in his pocket and extracts the wad stolen from
     the convenience store. The Old Man takes note. Butch
     selects a five and places it on the counter.
                                  OLD MAN
                Land's sake.   What line of work you in?
     The Old Man bags the goods, but Butch takes the shells and
     puts them in his coat pocket.
                                 BUTCH
                Used cars. Buy 'em, fix 'em up. Sold a

     Jerry puts his gun hand around Phillip's neck and pulls the
     sobbing boy closer. Jerry rests his face on Phillip's neck.
                                 JERRY
                Come over a little closer.
     As Jerry    groans, Phillip seizes the moment and bites Jerry
     hard on    the ear. Jerry screams and drops the gun, which
     Phillip    picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of
     the car    and into the hay field.
     Jerry, in pain, now with both ears bleeding, crawls out of
     the back seat and gives chase.

53   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                                   53
     Phillip, still sobbing, runs for his life in the hay, which
     is a full foot taller than he.
     JERRY
     no longer stumbling, now grinning maniacally, gives chase,
     whistling as if calling for a lost puppy.
                                 JERRY
                I'm gonna' find you boy.    You best come here.
     PHILLIP
     gun in hand, stumbles, falls, gets up, keeps running. He falls
     again and crawls to a stop. He wipes his tears and balls up
     on the ground trying to make himself invisible.

                                                             35.

     Butch exits with a grocery sack. When he sees the car doors
     open he dumps the groceries in the front seat and looks to
     the field.
     HIS POV
     The hay rustles as Jerry moves through the field.
55   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                              55
     Jerry, crouching, moves through the field -- eyes peeled for
     any sign of Phillip.
     Phillip lies still. He hears the hay rustling near him and
     he looks up, squares his body and points the revolver at...

     Butch, who spots him, motions for him to stay put and holds
     out his hand for the gun. Phillip hands it over and watches
     while Butch reaches into the plaid jacket pocket, extracts a
     few shells and loads the .38.
     JERRY
     a little frustrated now, but still moving forward.
                                JERRY
                       (a whisper)
               Hey boy. Hey boy. You better hope I
               don't find ya'.
     He spots something -- a dash of color -- and begins to crawl
     faster. He parts a thick batch of hay and looks up into the
     gun barrel and eyes of ...
     BUTCH

     squatted down,   who levels the revolver and closes one eye.
     Jerry laughs.
                                JERRY
               Whatcha' gonna' do? Hit me with it?
     Butch reaches into the coat pocket with his free hand and
     shows a shell or two. Jerry's grin drops.
                                JERRY
                       (pleading)

                                   BUTCH
               Thick as theives.
     PHILLIP
     hears a GUNSHOT and runs for his life back toward the store.

                                                             36.
56   EXT. PARKED IMPALA - DAY                                      56
     Phillip runs to the car and hides behind the tire opposite the
     store and field. In the b.g. we see Butch emerge from the
     field and walk toward the car.
     The Old Man, who also heard the shot, emerges from the store
     with a baseball bat.   Butch arrives at the car, spots the Old
     Man and levels the revolver at him. Phillip is relieved when
     he hears Butch's voice instead of Jerry's.
                               BUTCH
                      (to Old Man)
              You got a phone?
                                OLD MAN
              Naw.

                               BUTCH
              Then go inside and lie down til' we're gone.
     The Old Man meekly does so. Butch goes to the car door, opens
     it and motions to a frozen stiff Phillip.
                                BUTCH
              Well... Get in.

58   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                          58
     The place is a functioning mobile headquarters now. Adler on
     the short wave and tacking up a map, Bobby Lee still in his
     corner, Red and Sally sitting across from one another at the
     "kitchen table".

     In the rear section of the Airstream Red's chair and a mini
     office for the Chief have been put together.
                               ADLER
              Got a spot on 'em. A store right outside
              of Benhur. About 20 miles from here.
     Adler sets down the mike, sticks a tack on the map and stands
     back.
                               RED
              All right. Push the roadblock on 288
              north by 50 miles.
     Kaiser calls in the instructions. (NOTE:   Kaiser's radio
     transmissions are not scripted but go on a lot of the time
     we're in the Airstream. In addition, his  and Adler's direc-
     tions and missives to Bradley in the truck are not all

                Sunday drive. I like that. Never heard
                you use that one before, Red.
     Sally is watching Red and listening to all of this with a
     troubled look on her face. Red notices...

                It's... perhaps premature, but do you have
                an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they
                split up?
     Everyone stares.    No one ever questions Red.

                What makes you so sure they won't stay

                You got somethin' to say, spit it out.

                Their situation is one of accommodation.
                They won't be together long.
     Silence.   Sally continues.

                Haynes and Pugh are opposites. Haynes is
                a criminal's criminal -- armed robbery,
                mano y mano confrontation. Pugh, on the
                other hand, has a rap sheet littered with
                molestation and petty crime. They'll

              We don't have a dilemma. And neither do
              they. They'll keep one hostage... and get
              rid of one, if they haven't already.

              an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat.
     Red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to
     his office in the back. Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser chuckle
     lightly at their boss's snubbing of the female upstart in

                               SALLY
              You're the one that what?
     But Red side-steps.
                               RED
              Tell ya' what. You think I'm makin' a
              wrong turn you speak up. Might not agree,
              but I'll listen. As far as stepped on
              toes and wounded pride, I'll buy everyone
              a drink when we head for home. Not until.
              I got more to worry about.
                      (beat)
              That sound fair to you?
                                 SALLY
              Yes.
                                 RED
              Well okay then.
     Sally turns, about to leave.
                               RED
              So who's the other one?
                                 SALLY
              Other one?
                               RED
              If yer' one brain, who's the other?
                                 SALLY
              Haynes.    He was tested in prison.

     Butch drives and catches an occasional glance at Phillip who
     sits quietly, but who, too, steals looks at his captor
     between swigs of RC Cola.
     He finishes off the bottle. Butch reaches in the sack for
     another, pops the top on the dashboard and hands it to
     Phillip.
                               PHILLIP
              Thankyew.

     Butch realizes that in Phillip's eyes he and Jerry were
     probably friends.
                               BUTCH
              If I was choosin' a runnin' buddy, I'd

     The RV slides to a stop in the gravel parking lot which is
     full of state and local police. Red exits first, followed
     by the others. A LOCAL SHERIFF walks up to greet.
                               RED
              We got a positive I.D.?

                               LOCAL SHERIFF
              Yessir, with only the boy as hostage. But
              not five minutes ago we found something else.

     PAN FROM a fingertip UP an arm and TO the face of Jerry Pugh.
     A clean bullethole has left him with a third eye, a bloody
     back and an entourage of late summer flies. We hear the
     CLICK of a photographer's CAMERA.
     BOOM UP TO Red, Local Sheriff and other bystanders.
                               RED
              Least now we know who's in charge.

     Butch notices that Phillip is pretty somber as he tugs on
     another RC.

                               BUTCH

              You thinkin' about yer mama?
     Phillip sits still.    That was it.
     Butch brings the car to a stop.    He points to the horizon.
     Desolate.

              Lemme' ask you somethin'.    You right or
              left handed?
     Phillip meekly holds up his right hand.    The car races
     forward.
                               BUTCH
              Then that's the way we'll go. You ever
              ridden in a time machine before?
     Phillip shakes his head.
                                 BUTCH
              Sure you have.    Whattaya' think this is?
                                 PHILLIP
              A car.
                               BUTCH
              Yer' lookin' at this thing bassackwards.
              This is a 20th Century time machine.
              I'm the captain and you're the navigator.
     Butch points forward through the dash.

                               BUTCH
              Out there... that's the future.
     Butch taps on the rearview mirror.
                               BUTCH
              Back there... that's the past. If life's
              moving too slow and you wanna' project
              yerself into the future you step here on
              the gas. See?
     He does so and the Impala surges forward.
                               BUTCH
              And if yer' enjoyin' the moment yer' in,

                               BUTCH
              This is the present, Phillip.   Enjoy it
              while it lasts.
     Then he laughs uproariously and steps on the gas.

     The Impala spins out, kicking dirt in all directions.
                               BUTCH (V.O.)
              Yessir. Time travelin' through Texas! We
              got to find us a Ford. My daddy always
              drove Fords, you know that?

     The Airstream sits in the parking lot of the store.   Bradley
     and Suttle sit up front in the truck.
     INT. TRUCK - DAY
     Bradley turns the knob on an intercom speaker system next
     to the radio.
                               SUTTLE
              It's an intercom speaker system. You can
              get and give instructions to and from the
              rear of the vehicle.
                               BRADLEY
              How's it work?
                               SUTTLE
              You push the power button but if you've
              got the volume turned up...
     Bradley pushes the power button. The SYSTEM SQUAWKS LOUDLY
     and then CREAKS TINNILY. Speakers blown.
                               SUTTLE
              ... you'll blow the speakers.   Sheeeit...

     Red cringes, his ears still ringing from the squawk, and turns
     to stare at the front of the RV.

     Red shakes his head and stands in front of the map, placing
     thumbtacks at crossroads indicated by the circle mark.

              That oughta' put his pecker in a sling,

                      (ignoring Adler)
              Shouldn't these be roadblocked as well?
     She points to several other unmarked roads.
                               RED
              Sooner or later he'll get on a main road.
              We don't got the manpower to roadblock
              every farm to market.
                               ADLER
              In a perfect world, Miss Gerber, we'd lock
              arms and thrash the bush til' he turned up...

     Adler hears something on his headset, turns to Red.

              Locals are heading out.   Wanna' follow?

     The Impala travels slowly along the road until it edges to a
     stop by the entrance to a small farmhouse with a truck and
     car parked in a long dirt driveway. A farmer on a combine
     works a small field.

                                                               45.

              Ok, Phillip, we're gonna do some  car
              shoppin'. You ever play cowboys   n' Injuns?
              See that Ford sedan? Now I want   you to
              sneak on over there like an Injun  and take
              a peek and see if the keys is in  it.
     Phillip hesitates.
                               BUTCH
              Don't have to if you don't wanna... but
              I'd appreciate it... You bein' the new
              navigator and all.
     Phillip thinks it over then opens the door and slips out.

                               BUTCH
              Hey, Phillip, check for a radio, too.
70   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            70
     Phillip, still in his skivvies, legs cut up and muddied from
     his escape from Jerry, sneaks up to the car and quietly peers
     into the open window.
     The keys dangle when his small hand touches them.
     Phillip closes the door, looks around and then runs pell-mell
     to the passenger window of the Impala.
                               PHILLIP
              It's got keys and a radio.   I checked.
                               BUTCH
              Good man.

     Phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet.
                               PHILLIP
              Can we stop at a fillin' station.
                               BUTCH

              This here's nature, Phillip.   Pee in the
              ditch.
     Phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while Butch
     steps out of the Impala, tosses the keys into the field and
     walks toward the Ford.

     The FARMER stops his tractor and notices Butch and Phillip.
     Phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having trouble coaxing
     relief.
     Butch slides into the Ford, pumps the gas pedal and turns the
     key. The ENGINE GRUMBLES and DIES.
     The Farmer is walking now, slowly and then at a trot as he
     realizes what's happening.
     Phillip finally starts to pee.
     Butch cranks again and again but the Ford is flooded.

                               BUTCH
              Start, you sonofabitch!
     The Farmer runs faster, comes closer...
                               FARMER
              Hey, that's my car! Hey!!!
     Butch floors the gas to clear the flood and the ENGINE finally
     STARTS. He throws it into reverse and peels out backwards
     into the road beside the ditch where Phillip continues to
     relieve himself.
                               BUTCH
              Get in the car, Phillip!
     The Farmer, only 30 yards or so away, is racing toward them
     madder than a wet hen.
     Phillip tries to hurry but the RC continues to run through
     him.

                                BUTCH
              Phillip!   Get in the car!
     Phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car. He leaps
     into the open passenger door at the same moment Butch steps on
     the gas and the Farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it
     closes.

     The CAR is SCREECHING down the road but the Farmer holds on
     for dear life and auto. He claws at Phillip, who does his
     best to fend off flailing hands and fingers.
     Butch reaches under the seat for and grasps the pistol.
     Phillip sees what's about to happen and bites the Farmer's
     hand as hard as he can.

     The Farmer releases his grip on the door and falls backward,
     summersaulting into the adjacent ditch.
     Butch places the gun back under the seat.
                               BUTCH
              Goddam, boy, how many RC's did you drink
              anyway?
                                 PHILLIP
              Four.

     Butch shakes his head and laughs.
                               BUTCH
              One thing's for sure. You got one helluva

     Bobby Lee sits alone in the back corner of the main room of
     the RV. He just sits and stares, occasionally smiling
     cynically at Sally.

     Adler takes the latest info off the radio while the others
     listen in.

              The Ford he stole.
                               ADLER
              Owner told the locals they only drove it
              to church, but it does have a bad emergency
              brake.
                      (to Sally)

              He likes Fords.

     Adler looks at the map.
                               ADLER
              Looks like you was right, Red. He's off
              the farm to market and onto a spur.
              Whattaya' wanna' do?
                               RED
              Beef up the I-20 roadblock.
     Adler gets more news through the headsets.
                               ADLER
              What's that?

              Red, the locals wanna' know if they're to

     Red stares out the window for what seems like an eternity...

                                RED
              No.
     Adler looks quizzically at Red and pulls off the headphones...

              No, er, yes. No means negative.     Same
              thing. Over.
     Red sees Sally peering at him over the top of her file.      He
     glances around at the other sets of eyes.
                               RED
              I don't want some half-ass Sergeant York
              taking pot shots with a deer rifle.
     Adler puts the headphones back on.
     Bobby Lee smirks a bit.

                               SALLY
              It's the only thing to do.    He's got the
              child with him.
     Red gives her a look that says, "Don't defend me".

              Maybe, maybe not.
                               BOBBY LEE
              Well now there's a safe bet.
                               SALLY
              I'll give you a safe bet. The boy's
              in better hands now than he was.

              The third eye Pugh's sportin' on the way
              to the morgue shouts otherwise.
     Sally flashes Red a look back. Bobby Lee rises and moves
     past Red on his way to the toilet.
                               BOBBY LEE
                      (casually)

     Red just stares at Bobby Lee as the younger man moves slowly
     past him to the toilet.

     Red pulls out a package of Red Man chewing tobacco and mulls
     over the question while he slaps a wad into his cheek.

              Me'n you got a lot in common, Phillip.
              The both of us got blue eyes, we both

     The Ford pulls off the dusty road and into the lone pump in
     this dilapidated petrol mirage. A BUCK TOOTH BOY, 15, in
     overalls steps to the window.

      PAN TO: an ambulance door opens and the Farmer, strapped in,
      is rolled toward it as his wife, sobbing, attends to him.

      Several local police scour the surrounding field, walking
      four feet apart, looking for what they hope they won't find.
      Red leans on the trunk of the Impala, chews and spits on the
      ground. He sniffs the air. Unsavory. Adler strides up from
      the field.

      But it's black as night. A   CROWBAR CRANKS at the lock until
      the trunk blasts open like a  bottletop. A blast of light
      gives way to the silhouetted  faces of Red, Adler and Sally,
      who turns and walks away in  nauseous disgust.

     A long counter at the front of the store is backed by a small
     office with a large glass window that gives the Manager, MR.
     WILLITS, 45, bespectacled, anal-retentive, a clear view of the
     store. A nuclear family with two kids exits the store just as
     Butch and Phillip enter. Butch holds the door open and smiles
     at them. They say "thanks" but can't help but notice Phillip,
     cowering behind Butch, still clad in his underwear. He hides
     behind a nearby display which reads: Cast Your Vote For
     Friendly's Friendliest Clerk!
     A clerk, LUCY, 30, holding a handful of shoeboxes notices
     their entrance. She's schoolmarmish with a smile that looks
     like it's painted on.
                               LUCY
              Well, hello there and welcome to Friendly's.

              too. He'll tell you his size. Go with the
              lady, Buzz.
     Phillip, still in somewhat of a daze, doesn't recognize his

     Phillip snaps to, cracks a smile at Butch and follows the lady
     to the children's section of the store.
                               LUCY
              Buzz, what a cute name.   Like a bee.
     BUTCH

     walks past the cash register, gives the clerk behind the desk
     a wink and proceeds to an aisle which features hardware, rope,
     tape, nails, etc. He stoops and grabs a shank...
     ... with his hands he grips the rope tight and jerks it taut.
     CHILDREN'S AISLE
     Lucy is holding jeans up to Phillip's waist.
                               LUCY
              It'd be easier if I knew your size, but
              we'll get it right.
     Phillip's eye catches something...

     HALLOWEEN COSTUME DISPLAY
     on a circular rack with shelves. Hanging prominantly is a
     Casper the Friendly Ghost costume. Above it a sign reads:
     "MARKED DOWN - Get the Jump on Next Year!"
     CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
     mesmerized by the display.
     BUTCH
     takes a roll of electrician's tape. He tears off a strip,
     attaches it to the back or his hand and tugs. It holds tight.
     LUCY

     kneeling, looking for sizes, selects a pair and turns to find
     Phillip gone. She spins around and smiles when she sees...
     PHILLIP
     wearing the Casper mask.
                                   LUCY
               Why look.     It's a friendly ghost.   Say 'Boo.'
                                  PHILLIP
                         (unconvincingly)
               Boo.
                                   LUCY
               Not    very scary but you'll have a whole
               year    to work on it if your Daddy lets
               you    have it. Good price, too. What'd
               you    go as this year?

     He's greeted there by PAULA, to whom he earlier winked. She's
     25, country cute, and wears a fake smile that rivals Lucy's.
     Butch reaches for and tries on a pair of sunglasses.
                                 BUTCH
              Whattaya' think?
                                 PAULA
              Look good.
     He adds them to the pile of stuff.

              Will that be all for you today?

     Butch nods and hands over the goods.

              You folks are about the grinninest bunch I
              ever seen.
     Paula laughs, then drops her grin, looks behind her to see
     Mr. Willits is watching, and whispers...
                               PAULA
              Old Man Willits holds a contest ever'

              Here's the clothes, but Buzz has his

      Pete not expecxting this kind of pace, at least not from the
      get-go, leaps into his back seat.
      The Ford rams into the black and white pushing it backward
      into a lightpole and a truck. The TRUCK'S OWNER, carrying
      mulch from the feed store, watches as his truck slides
      toward him.

      Two young, country boys stand by the side of the road. One,
      FRANK, tosses an egg from hand to hand while he watches the
      horizon. The other, BILLY, approaches, crawling through a
      barb wire fence dragging something behind him.

                                 FRANK
               Hurry up.   Someone's comin'.
      ON HORIZON
      Sure enough, a hail of dust signals the approach of a vehicle
      a mile or so away.
      Billy crawls into the ditch next to Frank. We see what he's
      dragged from the field -- a scarecrow with a floppy hat and
      red bandana.
                                FRANK
               Stick it in the road. Hurry up.
      Billy does so, propping the scarecrow into a sitting position
      with a forked stick. Then he races back to the ditch and
      slides in next to Frank to divide the eggs.

               We got seven eggs. I get four to throw
               and you get three... since it was my idea.
      Billy nods.
                                 FRANK
               Here they come.   Aim for windows and get
               ready to run.
      The car crests the hill, followed by another, and another and
      a final one, all Highway Patrol, all with their lights on and
      SIRENS WAILING.
                                FRANK
               Oh shit!

      The cars don't even slow at the sight of the scarecrow, blast-
      ing right through it, sending hay, hat, limbs and all, flying.
      The scarecrow, or what's left of it, lands in a ditch next to
      the boys. In unison they breathe a sigh of relief, look at
      each other, drop the eggs and hightail it for home.

      The car is parked in a field of some sort.   Butch reaches in
      the back seat for the bag of clothing.
                                BUTCH
               Here, take them nasty skivvies off and
               put on yer' jeans.
      He spots Phillip's not so successful effort to hide the
      costume box.
                                BUTCH
               Whatya' got there?

                                 PHILLIP
               A ghost suit.
                                 BUTCH
               From the store?   You kyped it?
      Phillip nods, expecting the worst.
                                BUTCH
               Well, hell, Phillip, put it on.

               Stealin's wrong, ok? But if there's
               somethin' you need bad and you ain't got
               the money, then it's okay to take a
               loaner on the item. It's what ya' call
               an exception to the rule.
      Phillip tears into the box, rips out the costume, looks at it,
      starts to take off his underwear then balks. Butch notices.
                                 BUTCH
               What's wrong?
                                 PHILLIP

      Butch notices Phillip's hands covering his crotch.

               What? You don't wanna' get undressed,
               is that it?
      Phillip shrugs.

               What?
                                 PHILLIP
               It's puny.

                                BUTCH
               Well hell, lemme' see.
      Phillip still hesitates.
                                 BUTCH
               Go on.   I'll shoot ya' straight.
      Phillip gingerly pulls off his underwear. Butch smiles a
      broad grin.
                                BUTCH
               Hell no, Phillip, it's good size for a
               boy yer' age!
      Phillip, remasculated, smiles and starts to put on the
      costume.
                                 BUTCH
               Here they come.

      The four Highway Patrol VEHICLES from before BLAST past at
      90+, sending stray dogs and roadrunners scurrying for cover.
      CRANE    DOWN to reveal the Ford off the same roadside, but
      behind    a burm in a field. As soon as the patrol cars pass,
      Butch    STARTS up the ENGINE and humps it to the road and off
      in the    opposite direction.

      Sally, deep in her files.      She looks up from the file to...
      ANOTHER ANGLE
      Bobby Lee who sits by himself, whittling away at a stick and
      leering at her. Adler is at the map, holding the shortwave
      mike and wearing the earphones. Behind him, Red stares out
      the window.
                                ADLER
               Haynes bought tape, rope, and some clothes
               for the boy.
      Red comes to and turns to Adler. Sally smiles almost to her-
      self. She was right -- Haynes is looking after the boy.
      Everyone knows it, but no one says anything.
                                  ADLER
                 One puzzler though. They say the boy
                 could have gotten away but didn't.
                                  SALLY
                 Probably scared to death.
                                   ADLER
                 That's not all. The kid stole a
                 Halloween outfit.

                                  RED
                 Holy Jeezus, they're a team.

                 With the pit stop in Noodle looks like
                 he's headed for the Panhandle.
      Red sighs and groans. Unpleasant news but somehow he knew it.
      He moves to the back room for another shot of Geritol.

               roads then start on another one.

               But if anybody knows them backroads it's
               Red.
      Sally lifts her head, watches Red reenter the room, then
      stares out the window.

               Okay, so... I'm Robert Haynes. Called
               Butch by everyone. I was born in
               Amarillo, but grew up in the French
               Quarter of New Orleans.

                                SALLY
               I killed a man when I was eight.
      Silence. Nobody seems willing to play along.    Red turns
      from the window to Sally.
                                RED
               How'd ya' kill him?
                                SALLY
               Shot him with a pistol. There was always
               one around the dance hall. That's what
               they called it but it was a whorehouse.
               We lived there.
      Red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front
      of the Airstream, staring out the front window.
                                ADLER
               What'd the authorities do?

               The victim was wanted by the locals so
               the whole thing got shoved under the
               carpet Cajun-style.
                                ADLER
               They didn't even stick him in juvy?

               Nobody knows where he is now. Ditched
               when I was six. He was a small-time felon.
               Popped up again after Mom died -- he'd just
               been paroled. Moved us back to Amarillo.
               A year later I'm in trouble again.

      The Airstream slows to a grind, pulls off the narrow shoulder
      and begins to make a wide U-turn.

                We'll never make it. Stop!
      It's a close fit but the Airstream just survives a brush with
      a burm. The TRUCK PEELS away with Airstream in tow.

     The Ford makes a sharp veer off the road into a flat scrub
     brush field. The car spins out a bit when it hits the dirt
     sending forth a dust devil, then it regains its traction and
     blasts ahead through the dust.

     Trees, scrub brush and boulders are no deterrent for the
     sleek silverfish which seems to be moving even faster than
     before.

112   INT. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE (AUSTIN, TEXAS) - DAY             112
      A large group of very serious advisors sit and stand in a
      circle around the Governor's desk. Across from GOVERNOR
      CONNALLY sits a nervous, near tears GLADYS PERRY. An AIDE
      on the telephone, turns to the Governor.
                                AIDE
               They say the boy looked A-okay.
      Governor Connally nods, sighs, and reaches hand across the
      desk and touches Gladys's shoulder.
                                GOVERNOR
               He'll be fine, Mrs. Perry. This whole
               nightmare will be over and done with very
               soon and you'll be home with your boy. I
               promise.
      Gladys, distraught, nods. Governor Connally discreetly nods
      to a photographer in the group while keeping his hand on
      Gladys's shoulder. A CAMERA'S FLASH causes everyone to blink
      in reaction.
      The Governor shakes it off and continues...

      The Airstream, the amazingly futuristic piece of law
      enforcement equipment sits beat to hell and leaning to one
      side in the dry pond bed. All the tires are flat and dents
      and bruises abound. The door tries to open but is stuck.
      Red applies a boot to it and the whole thing comes off its
      hinges and flies to the ground. Red exits. He groans and
      shakes his head when he spots...
      Bradley and Suttle limping toward him across the field.
      Red sighs and starts slowly walking in the direction Butch
      and Phillip headed.

      Butch reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a folded
      postcard. He hands it over to Phillip.

      his mouth and follows, hurrying to catch up.

123   EXT. DUSTY FIELD - DAY                                            123
      Butch continues his hell-bent brisk pace in the field of dirt
      clods. It's all Phillip can do to keep up.
                                 PHILLIP
              Where we goin'?
                               BUTCH
              We're goin' trick r' treatin', Phillip.
      Phillip stops dead in his tracks. Butch, sensing that the boy
      is no longer following, stops, spins and faces Phillip.
                                 BUTCH
              What?
                               PHILLIP
              We ain't allowed to trick r' treat.
                                 BUTCH
              Huh?
                               PHILLIP
              My mama don't allow it.
                               BUTCH
              Trick r' treatin'? Why not?
                               PHILLIP

                               BUTCH
              Against yer' religion.     What kind of
              foolishness is that?

      Butch picks up a dirt clod and hurls it as far as he can.         He
      sighs and turns to Phillip.

124   EXT. YARD OF FARMHOUSE                                        124
      Butch and Phillip cross the dirt yard and make their way to
      the door.
                                 BUTCH
                Ok, Phillip, all ya' gotta' do is knock
                on the door and when they open it you say
                'trick or treat.' Got it?

      They arrive at the door.   Butch nods at Phillip who RINGS the
      BUZZER.
                                BUTCH
               Now wait til' they come.
      A FARM WIFE, 65 or so, like something from a Grant Wood, only
      smiling, opens the door and looks out on the pair through the
      screen door.
                                BUTCH
                       (whispers)
               Now, Phillip.
                                 PHILLIP
               Trick r' treat.
                                WOMAN (FARM WIFE)
               Well ain't you the cutest lil' ghost I
               ever did see.
                                BUTCH
                       (whispers)
               Say it again, Phillip.

                                PHILLIP
               Trick r' treat, ma'am.
                                WOMAN
               Well, seein' that Halloween was yesterday,
               I guess you'll have to trick me. You
               missed the caramel popcorn balls I made
               up special.
      Butch smiles, pulls up his shirt and exposes the revolver
      stuck in his pants.

      The Woman returns with an armload of anything she could find
      in the kitchen. Phillip gratefully opens his sack and watches
      as the Woman drops in a loaf of bread, a jar of mustard,
      candies, jams, butter and anything else she could find.
      Empty-handed she reaches inside the door, opens her purse and
      dumps her money -- a couple of dollars and lots of change into
      the bag.

      Phillip smiles.
                                 PHILLIP
               Thankyew.
125   EXT. YARD - DAY (SECONDS LATER)                                125
      Phillip, sack in hand, waves goodbye to the frightened old
      Woman, who shuts her door and locks it.
      Butch and Phillip make their way back across the yard.
                                BUTCH
               Never underestimate the kindness of the
               common man, Phillip.
      Butch reaches up and grabs the phone line, yanks it loose and
      tosses it aside.
126   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                           126

      The Airstream is fast becoming a pig sty. Coke bottles,
      coffee spills, overfull ashtrays, etc. are everywhere. Adler
      holds the mike and stares at the thumbtacked map.

                                 RED
               Yeah.
      Adler moves to set down the mike and topples a cup of coffee.
      It spills on the floor. Suttle grabs a towel to wipe it up
      but realizing the futility of keeping the Airstream clean, he
      simply throws it aside.

                                                               79.
127   INT. FORD - LATER - DAY                                        127
      Butch drives while Phillip digs through the sack and comes
      up with a jar of mustard.
                                 BUTCH
                You sure there's no meat in there? Spam
                maybe, Vienna sausages, anything like that?
                                    PHILLIP
                Nawsir.
                                 BUTCH
                Well, I bet you can make us some mustard
                sandwiches, can't ya'?
                                    PHILLIP
                Yeahsir.
                                    BUTCH
                Well go to it.
      Phillip breaks out the loaf of bread and lays out four
      slices on the dashboard.
                                    PHILLIP
                How many?
                                    BUTCH
                Many as you want.
      Phillip   lays out six more slices. The dashboard is now
      covered   with bread. Phillip pulls out the mustard but has no
      knife.    Butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to
      Phillip   to spread with.
      As they drive  along they pass a large, happy family (Mom, Dad,
      girl 5, boy 7)  picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside
      the highway.   From the look of their brand-new loaded down
      station wagon  they are on vacation.
      CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
      Mesmerized by the family.
      CLOSEUP - BUTCH
      Ditto.    He pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something.

      Butch brings the car to a stop near the crest of the hill,
      sets the emergency brake, grabs the first completed mustard
      sandwich and gets out, leaving the Impala running.

                Be right back. Don't be stingy with
                that mustard now.
      Phillip nods and continues piling the yellow goop on each of
      the slices of bread.
      BUTCH
      walks ahead to the crest of the hill, the tallest hill in the
      county. He takes in the 360 degree view. His eyes settle
      on...
      LINE OF CARS

      IDLING as they wait their turn to pass a roadblock at the
      bottom of the hill.
      PHILLIP
      spreading even more mustard. Every so often he sneaks a peek
      back at the picnicing family.
      EMERGENCY BRAKE
      slips a little, then gives all at once.

      back down the hill.

                Step on the brake! Put your foot on the
                brake! The middle one!!
      PHILLIP
      panicked, slides over and grabs the wheel. Of course, he is
      too short to press on the brake and when he bends down...
      FORD
      swerves off the road and onto the shoulder.

                Are you crazy.    It's only got a 1000 miles
                on it!
      He jumps in the Driver's seat of the WAGON and frantically
      REVS it just as...
      PHILLIP
      gains control of the wheel and steers the rapidly reversing
      Ford around the Wagon.
      FORD
      continues backwards to the bottom of the hill, but it has
      enough steam built up to head backwards up the other incline
      of the previous hill.
      BUTCH
      comes to a heaving halt next to Bob, who is near heart attack
      himself.

                That was close.
      Bob gets out of the station wagon and stands next to Butch.
      They watch for the Ford for a second, see that it's losing
      momentum and smile at each other.

      FORD
      like any car on a roller coaster, starts to move downhill,
      slowly at first, but then picking up speed.

                 kids like the back down like that so they
                 can play.
                                  BUTCH
                 No trouble at all, Bob.

      Bob brings his precious car to a gingerly stop.    He pulls out
      his license, shows it.
                                  BOB
                 Why the roadblock, Officer?
                                  OFFICER
                 Escaped convict, sir. Just a precaution.

      Bradley examines the gooseneck hitch. Bobby Lee sits on a
      nearby rock, still whittling at his stick. It's starting to
      resemble something.

      As in the old Westerns, it's quiet, too quiet. The      inside of
      the RV is pretty much trashed now -- the product of     men
      working in close contact. Sally stares at a file.       The
      silence is broken as Red spits tobacco juice into an     empty
      Coke bottle.
      Sally peruses a file.
      INSERT - FILE

      It's Butch's again. She's reading an addendum page with
      JUVENILE COURT RECORD stamped at the top. A photo of 14-year-
      old Butch is stapled in the corner.
      BACK TO SCENE
      Sally finds something very interesting.    She looks up at Red.
      He returns her stare.
                                RED
               What?

      Bobby Lee finishes his whittling, blows away shavings,
      smiles at his creation, sets it on the rock, gets up and
      walks away.

               They've got two Highway Patrol cars they
               can give to us now.

               Tell 'em stand by. We got the     best seat
               in the house right here. Have     the
               southern roadblocks call in the    dogs and
               move north. Check every road,     every farm
               from San Angelo to Sweetwater.

      Adler surveys the map and sticks in a few more thumbtacks.
                                ADLER
               He knows he's hemmed in. I predict we'll
               have him singing a different tune by
               nightfall.

      The red station wagon creeps along the highway to the
      whistled strains of "Old MacDonald had a Farm."
137   INT. STATION WAGON - DAY                                         137
      Butch, truly "singing a different tune," whistles "Old
      MacDonald." Bob joins in and soon the whole damn Family Bob
      is whistling the tune.
      Bob's daughter PATSY, 5, red hair, freckles, starts jumping
      up and down on the back seat, singing and spilling her drink.
                                   BOB'S SON
               You're spilling!     You're spilling!
      Bob and his Wife immediately turn around.
                                  WIFE
               Patsy!    Look at what you're doing?!
                                   BOB
               Ahhh noooo!
      Bob's wife grabs Patsy by the arm and shakes her. Butch con-
      tinues to whistle softly, almost eerily, but he's watching
      closely.
                                BOB'S WIFE
               Look at what you did! It's all over
               the seat of your father's new car!
      The little girl    starts to cry while Bob grabs at tissues
      feverishly and    hands them to his Wife who, leaning over the
      seat is wiping    hard at the stain. She grabs her daughter's
      arm and shakes    her, staring into her face.
      Butch, directly behind the little girl, watches closely.
                                BOB'S WIFE
               What is wrong with you?! I told you twice
               not to jump up and down! Didn't I!!
      Patsy bawls harder than ever. Bob's Wife finishes wiping and
      reseats herself in the front seat.

               Damn that kid!
      The little girl is crying harder than ever now. Bob reaches
      back over the seat and tries to touch his daughter.
                                BOB
               It's okay, sweetie. Daddy's not mad.
                                BOB'S WIFE
               So much for the new car smell.
      The little girl muffles her tears.

      Butch smiles sincerely then looks to the passing landscape.
                                BUTCH
               This will do fine right here, Bob.   But I
               do have one more favor to ask.
138   EXT. ROAD - DAY (FIVE MINUTES LATER)                           138
      The entire Family Bob is standing along the roadside, their
      luggage and belongings by their side. The looks on their
      faces say it all -- Stranded.
      Butch hands over the stuffed animal to Patsy, pats Bob Jr. on
      the head and sticks out his hand to Bob.
                                BUTCH
               Just a loaner, Bob. Not to worry.    You'll
               get her back.
      Bob reluctantly shakes Butch's hand in an attempt to impress
      upon Butch his most important concern of all...

                                BOB
               Please, it's new. Hold it under 45... at
               least for the next 500 miles.
                                BUTCH
               You know I will, Bob.
      Butch gives a snappy salute and is off to the wagon.

      Butch STARTS the CAR and he and Phillip slowly pull away.
                                 BUTCH
               Wave, Phillip.
      Phillip does so.   Bob's kids wave back.   Phillip starts to
      giggle.

                                BUTCH
               Maybe, but Bob did the right thing. What
               if he'd put up a fight? I mighta' had to
               shoot him, and where would that family be
               then? Naw, Bob's a fine family man and
               that's about the best thing a fella' can
               hope to be.
      Butch floors the wagon and the CAR SCREECHES rubber on the

      across the winding plains of West Texas.

      A skinny, small town WAITRESS checks her face in a bathroom
      mirror. She applies too much lipstick and pinches her cheeks
      before exiting. We FOLLOW as she exits the kitchen bathroom
      door, grabs two already prepared hamburger platter specials
      from beside the grill and moves through a swinging door into
      the diner. A counter, three booths, grease everywhere...
      She sets the two plates in front of Butch and Phillip at a
      booth.
      Butch digs in but Phillip holds for a beat. Butch notices
      and stops chewing while Phillip says "grace".

      She leans down to the table and flirts with her overdone eyes.
                                   BUTCH
               You Dottie?
                                WAITRESS
               Eileen. Dottie died. Her son runs the
               place but... he ain't never here.
                                   BUTCH
               Never?

               He leaves at four. Not much traffic
               after lunch.

      She brazenly stares a hole through Butch as she lifts a slice
      of pickle off his plate, places it in her mouth and slowly
      chews.
      Phillip, mouth full, takes note of the confusing spectacle.
      Eileen turns to walk away.
                                EILEEN
               If you need me, I'll be right over here.
      She slowly sashays away to behind the counter.
      Butch watches her every step. Phillip chews and watches
      Butch's eyes. Butch turns his head and catches Phillip
      watching him.
                                BUTCH
               Eat yer' food.
146   EXT. FIELD - AIRSTREAM - DUSK                                  146

      A SIRLOIN STEAK hits a grill beside a Tater Tot shiskabob and
      SIZZLES to beat the band.
      A homemade barbecue pit, built from nearby abundant rocks,
      sits square in the middle of the highway with red flares set
      up just in case a car did come by.
      Red smiles and shakes a liberal dose of Lea and Perrins onto
      the flesh. He's obviously a veteran of many back yard B-BQs
      and this is definitely one.
      We see Sally THROUGH the window. She's inside, still going
      over her files. She gets up and walks into the back room to
      look for something.

      BACK TO SCENE
      Red continues to cook with Adler and Bradley looking on.
147   INT. AIRSTREAM - BACKROOM - DUSK                                147
      Sally turns on a nightlight and looks at herself in the
      mirror. She splashes a little water on her face and is
      startled when ...
      Bobby Lee slides in behind her.

                                BOBBY LEE
               Think yer' pretty smart now don'tcha'?
      She doesn't back down, instead looking him straight in the
      eye.
                                SALLY
               Excuse me?
                                BOBBY LEE
               Well yer' not smart but you are pretty.
      Sally stares right at Bobby Lee then moves for the door.    He
      shifts his position and blocks her.
                                SALLY
               Excuse me.
      Bobby Lee smiles a crooked-tooth grin, refusing to move.
                                BOBBY LEE
               Work and pleasure should naturally go
               together don't you think? Take me, I
               enjoy my work.
                                SALLY
               I could give a shit.

               A woman after my own heart.
      She takes this opportunity to slide between Red and Bobby Lee
      on her way into the main room. As she goes...
                                RED
               I'll just wipe its ass, herd it through and
               you can cut off a hunk. How'd that be?
                                SALLY
               Maybe medium-rare.
      Bobby Lee and Red are left standing face to face.
                                RED
               I don't give a damn who you work for.
               You're here for one reason and one
               reason only.
                                BOBBY LEE

               Yeah.   Yer' in my office.
      The hot line PHONE RINGS...
      Bobby Lee flinches first and moves back into the main room.
      Red follows.
                                ADLER
               That's the Governor's line, Red!
      Red calmly walks past Sally who smiles a "thanks". He gives
      her a one finger to the hat salute, walks to the phone,
      reaches down and yanks out the cord. The RINGING STOPS.

148   INT. DOTTIE'S    CAFE - NIGHT                                148
      Phillip, at the booth, plays with the parsley on his empty
      plate, which sits across from Butch's barely touched one. The
      boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a peek at Butch, who
      sits at a barstool watching Eileen work behind the counter.

      AT COUNTER
      Butch leans over and whispers something sexy into Eileen's
      ear. She giggles and licks her lips.
      Butch feels eyes on his back and looks at Phillip, who
      immediately turns away from them. When Butch returns his
      attention to Eileen she's moved a few feet away and is
      refilling ketchup bottles.
                                BUTCH
               Buzz, go ahead and chew on mine if you want.
                                PHILLIP
               No thankyew.

      Eileen slides back down toward Butch. She makes refilling
      condiment bottles the sexiest pasttime since the hula hoop.
                                EILEEN
               Very polite.
                                BUTCH
               I try hard but, ya' know, since his mama
               died...
                                PHILLIP
               -- My mama's not dead!
      Butch, a tad annoyed, turns to Phillip and gives him a look.
      Once again, when he turns back, Eileen has moved.
      She's flirting with Butch, moving, bending, wiping her hands
      on her hips. His eyes are focused on her every squirm.
                                BUTCH
                       (over his shoulder)
               Okay now, Buzz, you go on out in the parking
               lot and chunk some rocks or something.
      BACK TO SCENE
      Phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks
      out the door. His eyes stay on Butch and Eileen, barely
      concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy.
                                EILEEN
               So is she dead or not?

               Well his biological mother is alive. Gave
               him up for adoption to me and my wife. My
               dead wife, that is. She is, was Phil, er
               Buzz's stepmother, so she's his mom, was his
               mom, stepmom, but... she's dead.

      But she's not.     In fact it seems to have turned her on even
      more.
      She puts her hand behind Butch's neck and slowly pulls him
      close for gentle kiss.
149   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                        149
      Phillip tosses a rock then turns to the diner. They're gone.
      Phillip drops his handful of rocks and walks to the front
      window of the diner.

      PHILLIP'S POV - DINER
      It is empty. He sees that the kitchen swinging door is still
      swinging on its hinges.
150   INT. DINER - ADJUNCT OFFICE - NIGHT                             150
      A one room addition office built onto    the kitchen. It has a
      desk against one wall, a few chairs, a    fan -- pretty sparse.
      Two large windows throw light from the    outside neon sign onto
      the room. A large lamp provides harsh     light.
      Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door
      behind them. At once they are all over each other. Butch
      lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and
      neck. Then, in an instant, he flips her over, pulls the
      ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress
      outfit to the waist. He kisses her neck, her back and
      suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins
      kissing her voluptuous backside.

151A EXT. DINER - NIGHT                                               151A
      Phillip, a bit scared, moves around the side of the front of
      the diner and sees something.

      In profile Butch continues to kiss Eileen's buttocks.     She
      moans in ecstasy.

      Phillip, like a pacifist at a prizefight, doesn't want to
      watch but can't not watch. He moves down the wall to a
      window positioned right at the desk. When he stops he's right
      in front of the window, separated from Butch and Eileen by
      only a foot of air and a thin plate of glass.

                                                              96.

      Kissing, writhing, but FROM this ANGLE  all he can really see
      is a mane of hair swinging to and fro.   Butch is out of sight
      but it's obvious that his lips continue  to caress Eileen's
      backside. She cranes her neck, arching   it like a swan,
      moaning like a wildebeast and then...
      She stops and stares STRAIGHT AHEAD. Butch continues to kiss
      but only for a beat, sensing the locomotive he's on has
      stopped at an unscheduled station. He slides his face from
      around her rear, a la Kilroy, and he stares, too. Except for
      their continuing heavy breathing they could be modern art
      statues staring STRAIGHT AHEAD AT...

      any harder there wouldn't be any glass.
152B BUTCH AND EILEEN                                         152B

      the parking lot.

      parking lot.

      In the b.g., over his shoulder, the cafe door opens, CLANGING

154   INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT                             154
      Silence. Butch drives away libidinous desires, Phillip sits
      quietly, staring straight ahead, now and again stealing a peek
      at Butch.
                                PHILLIP

               Hell, I don't know how it looked....
      As Butch's voice trails off silence overtakes the car. After
      a few seconds Butch seems happy not to have to answer any
      more questions. Phillip fidgits with the door handle.
      Several more seconds pass, then...

155   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT (LATER)                               155
      The station wagon pulls off the main dirt road and onto a
      smaller, private road. After 150 yards or so, it leaves the
      graded dirt and, shocks bouncing, crosses into a plowed field
      and comes to a dusty stop.

      gristle and bone, cigarettes burning in ashtrays and swirl-

      groaning and picking their teeth with toothpicks.

      B)   A Haynes family photo -- a grizzled father standing
           behind a mother seated holding a baby. They stand
           in front of a small, white framed house.
      C)   Extreme closeup -- The baby in the snapshot - Butch.
      D)   Snapshot of a young Butch, age 6, with his father and
           another adult male, who are both holding deer rifles
           with one hand and with the other the antlers and head
           of a dead deer.
      E)   Extreme closeup -- Butch's father from the same photo.
      F)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, with his mother but no father.

      G)   An establishing snapshot of a nightclub in New Orleans.
           The gaudy sign above the joint reads: CLUB - DANCE HALL.
      H)   A snapshot of Butch's mother dressed in a somewhat
           sleazy Latino outfit. She's surrounded by 3 or 4
           lounge lizard types, whose hands are all placed on
           parts of her body. She has a drunken sneer on her face.
      I)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, being taught to dance in the club
           by his mother. He looks awkwardly into the camera.
      J)   Snapshot of Butch, 8, sitting on the bar of the club,
           surrounded by a motley group of sleazy "dime dancers".
      K)   Another snapshot of Butch being taught to dance by his
           drunken mother.
      (NOTE: A heavy MACHINE GROWL should START LOW and INCREASE
      IN VOLUME through the remainder of these fast-paced series
      of cuts.)

      L)   Snapshot of Mom dancing very closely, too closely, to
           a handsy patron of the club.
      M)   Snapshot of Mom kissing the same man.   We see a tattoo
           on his arm.
      N)   Extreme closeup -- the tattoo. It is of a naked
           girl. The words "hell-bent" in cursive frame the
           tattoo.
      O)   Snapshot of Mom sitting on the tattooed man's lap at
           the bar. His hand is resting on the inner portion of
           her thigh.
      P)   Snapshot of Butch at the bar with the club bartender.
      Q)   Same as (K) -- Butch being taught to dance.

      U)    Same as (O).   Mom with tattooed man.
      V)    Extreme closeup -- tattooed man from same photo.
      W)    Snapshot of crime scene in the bar. A man lies      on the
            floor in a pool of blood. Onlookers, including      some of
            the dime dancers and Butch's mom, express their     shock
            at the incident while police photographers and     newsmen
            look on.

      X)    Extreme closeups    -- Some of the onlookers faces.
      Y)    Extreme closeup    -- Butch's mom's face. As  opposed to
            the others, her    face is rather displaced.  You'd think
            she'd witnessed    a fender bender instead of a murder.
      Z)    Extreme closeup -- The face of the victim.      It's
            the tattooed man.
      AA)   Extreme closeup -- The tattoo.

      light shines directly at...
      EXTREME CLOSEUP - BUTCH
      who exits his dream and enters reality with a throttled
      shock. He squints and tries to discern the source of the
      light while groping for his gun under the seat.
      BUTCH'S POV - WHITE LIGHT
      It's bright as hell but getting clearer, less fuzzy.
      We can now see it's the headlights of a huge COMBINE which
      sits, ENGINE RUNNING, directly in front of the station
      wagon.

      A BLACK MAN - 50 or so, KILLS the ENGINE (but leaves the
      lights on) steps down from the combine cab and starts
      toward the station wagon.
      BACK TO SCENE
      Phillip, now wide awake and scared.   He notices that...
      Butch is fingering the gun, resting it in his hands and
      under his right leg.
      The Black Man, whose name is Mack, crosses the front of the
      wagon and walks to the driver's side window.
                                 MACK (BLACK MAN)
                Didn't mean to scare ya'. I work at

                                 BUTCH
                Drove from Texarkana yesterday.
                                 MACK
                Quite a haul.
                                 BUTCH
                Said a mouthful there.

                                 MACK
                Well, ain't no sense in ya'll
                sleepin' in the car. Not when I got a
                fold out couch sittin' empty.
                                 BUTCH
                Wouldn't want to put you out.     'Sides we
                need to get back on the road.
                                 MACK

165   INT. HIGHWAY PATROL CAR - DAY                                  165
      Two officers, MONTGOMERY and HALL, scan the horizon.    They
      look like they've driven all night.
      Saunders wakes up in the back seat and leans forward.
                                SAUNDERS
               We didn't pass it did we?
      Saunders spots the RV on the horizon.
                                  MONTGOMERY
               There it is.

      Hall and Montgomery view the beat to hell RV while Saunders,
      ready to cry, jumps out and runs into the field.
                                 MONTGOMERY
               Good Gawd Almighty. Governor ain't

      Suttle is asleep among the rubble. He jumps to when
      Saunders bursts in. Saunders gasps when he sees the shape
      his prize vehicle is in.
                                  SAUNDERS
               Where are they?!
                                SUTTLE
               Uh, uh, they're gone.

               How long?!
                                SUTTLE
               I don't know, uh, four, five hours.
      Saunders, dejected, starts to move some of the trash from
      the couch. He sits down and moans...
                                SAUNDERS
               Well, goddammit, did he say anything?
                                  SUTTLE
               Yeah.

               you that the vehicle gets his seal of
               approval....
      Saunders' face begins to turn red.
                                SUTTLE
               And that he wants his chair back.
      If he was red before, now Saunders is crimson.   A ther-
      mometer dropped into boiling water.

      We hear a SCREAM and then a second later, Red's desk chair
      comes flying out the door. It hits a rock and splits as it
      bounces.

      A COFFEEPOT RATTLES on the stove.
      Two black hands move the pot and rescue overfried eggs in
      a skillet on the stove.
      Two small black   feet dangle from a too-high bathroom
      toilet. As they    hit the ground we hear a FLUSH. We
      FOLLOW the feet   DOWN down a short hall and into the
      living room. As    they pass the bottom of a fold-out couch
      we...
      BOOM UP to reveal Butch and Phillip asleep. Butch's arm
      has found its way under Phillip's head and is acting as
      an early morning pillow.

      A small head pops up on the side of the bed nearest
      Phillip. The six-year-old eyes of CLEVELAND peer close
      to Phillip and watch, only inches away, as Phillip sleeps.
      Phillip's eyes blink a bit and then they open...

      Cleve, still whispering and giggling with Phillip, isn't
      really listening.
                                MACK
               Don't ya hear good, boy?!
      Mack firmly cuffs the boy's ear and Cleve jumps up and out
      the door, one hand holding the side of his head. Butch and
      Phillip both look up at Mack.

      Phillip sits on   the couch and watches as Butch shows Cleve
      a trick. Cleve    bends over, puts his hands between his legs
      and Butch grabs   them and pulls -- a flip. Cleve is
      ecstatic at the   result. Phillip and Butch laugh along.

               We left her at home this time.   Boy's
               night out kinda thing.
      Butch spots an old phonograph.
                                   BUTCH
               Say, lookie here.
      He gives it a spin with his finger and searches through a
      stack of 78s.

                                LOTTIE
               Mr. Andrews give 'em to us when he got
               hisself a newfangled one.
      Butch finds a particular favorite.
                                BUTCH
               Jeezus. Now this is music. You know
               how long it's been since I heard this.
                                LOTTIE
               That's an oldie all right. Mrs.
               Andrews' maiden name was Bougeois --
               half-Creole herself she is, but Mr.
               Andrews he don't like nobody to know.
               'Suppose that's why he give 'em to us.

      Mack drops his pants and sits on the throne. He reaches
      over and turns ON the RADIO resting on the wash basin. A
      FARM REPORT comes on just as...
178   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       178
      A NEEDLE DROPS on a 78, filling the room with the SCRATCHY
      sounds of a Coonass waltz.
      Butch's eyes come to life.
                                BUTCH
               You dance, Lottie?
                                   LOTTIE
               Lawd goodness no.

               Here, jus' follow me.
      He takes her in his arms and slowly but surely adjusts her
      movement to his. After a few rough turns they're not too
      bad.
      Phillip can't help but smile as he and Cleve watch and
      giggle.
      Butch and Lottie dance, swirling around the room.
                                LOTTIE
               Mr. Poe, you sure can move.

                                BUTCH
               Oughta be able to. Was raised in a dime
               a dance whorehouse.
                                  LOTTIE
               Yer' foolin' me?
                                BUTCH
               No, ma'am. My mama would dance their
               asses out of the fryin' pan and into the
               back room fire.
      Butch spots Phillip and Cleve, watching, giggling.
                                BUTCH
               Get on yer' feet, Buzz.     You'n Cleve
               shake a leg.

                       (encouraging)
               Well go on!

      Cleve and Phillip reluctantly stand and stare at one
      another.
                                  BUTCH
               Dance, boys!
      The little boys do their best to emulate the adults and
      soon they're laughing and dancing, too.
      The RECORD STOPS. They all clap and laugh.         Butch hears
      something... The RADIO in the bathroom.

      the radio announcer begins a news flash.

               Update on the manhunt for the escaped
               convict. Haynes is armed and extremely
               dangerous. He is believed to have a
               hostage with him, an eight-year-old boy.
      A finger turns OFF the RADIO. We FOLLOW the finger UP an
      arm TO Butch's concerned face. He sits down on the edge of
      the tub across from Mack and takes the knife away from him.
                                BUTCH
               We'll be leavin' soon enough. I'll kill
               all of you if you try anything stupid.
      Mack swallows hard.

      Lottie quizzes Phillip...
                                LOTTIE
               What's Texarkana like? I ain't never
               been there.

               Oh, it's real nice. I got a dog named...
               Phillip and a tree house and...
      Mack, nervous, enters the room followed by Butch.
                                 BUTCH
               Come on, Buzz.   Time for us to hit the
               road.
                                LOTTIE
               Whass' wrong, Mack? You look like you
               seen a ghost.
      Cleve runs up to Butch, turns around backwards and puts his
      hands between his legs.
                                  CLEVE
               Do me agin'!

               No!   Boy! Get over by yer' Mammaw!
      Lottie senses something is wrong.   Cleve, too young to
      smell trouble, persists...
                                CLEVE
               Come on, Mister, do me agin'!

      Butch smiles and starts to oblige the boy, but Mack inter-
      venes and smacks Cleve hard, sending him sprawling to the
      floor bawling.
      Butch, instantly enraged, back-hands Mack, grabs him by the
      collar and tosses him onto the floor.
      Phillip -- frozen, sitting, watching as things go from bad
      to worse.
      Cleve -- confused, bawling, afraid.
      Butch pulls    the gun from his pants, bends down, picks up
      Mack by his    throat, presses the gun in his mouth and lifts
      him into a    chair beside Lottie. He bends close to Mack --
      their noses    are inches apart.
                                  BUTCH
               Why'd ya'   wanna' go and hit Cleve for?
               He didn't   move fast enough for ya', is
               that it?    Or maybe he gets excited
               sometimes   and don't hear everything ya'
               say? You    make me sick to my stomach.
      Butch spits in Mack's face, then rises and walks over to
      Phillip and hands him the revolver.
                                   BUTCH
               Point it at 'em.
                                   PHILLIP
               I don't wanna'...
                                   BUTCH
               Point it!

      Phillip does so, occasionally wiping a tear from his eye.
      Mack reaches down and holds Lottie's hand.
      Butch kneels down to a still-sobbing Cleve.
                                BUTCH
               Now, son, you wanna' flip?
      Cleve shakes his head "no" between sobs. Butch gently
      takes the boy and lifts him to a standing position.
                               BUTCH
               Go ahead. Put yer' hands between yer'
               legs. I won't hurt ya'.
      Cleve turns to Mack and then runs to him. Butch walks
      calmly over and pulls the crying child away from the old man
      and back to the center of the room.

                         (to Cleve)
                 Put yer' hands 'tween yer' legs, son.
      Cleve,    still sobbing, does so. Butch reaches down and
      flips    him, all the while staring at Mack. Each time he
      flips    the boy, Butch reaches down, grabs Cleve's hands and
      flips    him again.
      Finally he allows the frightened child to go to Mack and
      Lottie.

      Butch takes the gun from Phillip.
                                    BUTCH
                 Buzz.    Go out to the car and get that
                 rope.
      Phillip stands frozen.

                 Phillip!...
      Phillip slowly rises and walks away.      He stops for a moment
      and turns his back.
      EXTREME CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
      His eyes lock in a gaze with...
      EXTREME CLOSEUP - CLEVE
      His sobbing eyes plead for something, anything.

      station wagon. He opens the door, stops, looks back.

                 Now you hold that boy and tell him you

      Butch cocks the revolver and slides forward.     His nose is
      almost touching Mack's.

      in his hand.
      HIS POV
      Butch sits on the coffee table, which is pushed right up
      to Mack, Lottie and Cleve, who sit on chairs.
184   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                         184

      Butch, enthralled with the episode he's directing, almost
      quivers with anticipation.
                                  BUTCH
                Say it, Mack.   Don't cost nuthin'.
                                 MACK

                        (serious)
                Gawd that's beautiful.
      Butch spots Phillip standing at the entrance to the living
      room with the bag. He takes it from the boy, empties the
      contents -- candy, cookies, bread, sugar and all -- and
      picks up the rope, takes Mack's Barlow knife from his
      pocket and cuts off a long shank. Butch takes the rope and
      begins to tie up the three.

      Phillip stands, stares, aware that something bad is
      happening.
      Butch finishes tying, sticks the knife in his pocket and
      walks over to the PHONOGRAPH. He turns it back ON. The
      SCRATCHY RECORD plays. He turns UP the VOLUME.
                                BUTCH
                       (to Phillip)
               You can go wait in the car or you can
               watch. Yer' old enough to think for
               yer'self.
      Phillip, unsure what to do, stands his ground.

      Butch returns to his seat   on the coffee table and stares
      at the three hostages. He    appears as if he's about to cry,
      closes his eyes and rests   his chin on the barrel of the
      revolver while he recites   instructions...
                                BUTCH
               Shut yer' eyes, Cleve. Mack, you and
               Lottie hold the boy tight. Shut yer'
               eyes, too.
      Phillip, awkwardly aware that he's going to witness an
      execution, starts to cry out, then squelches himself.
      Butch seems to be in another world now -- taken to another
      place and time. A slight smile finds its way to his face,
      then disappears.
                                LOTTIE
               Please, mistah', ain't no use in it.
                                MACK
               We'll give you ever'thing we got!
      But Butch doesn't even hear the words. He slowly opens his
      eyes, pulls his chin from the pistol barrel and points it
      at Mack.
                                LOTTIE

      Butch looks to Phillip in a strange way, sets the gun on
      the floor between them, and crawls amongst the candy, gum
      and wrappers until he finds the electrician's tape.
      Phillip watches, not knowing what to do.
      The revolver -- cocked, resting on the floor.

                                MACK, CLEVE & LOTTIE
               Giv' us this day our daily bread and
               forgiv' us, Lawd, our trespasses as we
               forgiv' those who tresspass agin' us...
      Butch rips tape from the roll and slaps a piece over each
      of their mouths, silencing their prayers one by one.
      Out of breath, he kneels down in front of them and stares
      at the three while he reaches his hand behind him for the
      .... pistol -- but it's not there...
      Butch looks up to see...
      Phillip -- teeth gritted, holding the pistol, pointing it
      directly at Butch.
      CLOSEUP - BUTCH
      His expression is blank -- then a slight smile. For a
      second it's as if none of this has happened, that Butch will
      grasp Phillip in his arms...
      A DEAFENING GUNBLAST turns his expression to blank.
      Phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver's kick,
      recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf.
      The MAMBO RECORD comes to an END, but SCRATCHES ON AD
      INFINITUM.
      Butch falls back to his knees, still staring at Phillip.
      He looks at his stomach, where a stain of brown-red
      gushes through his T-shirt, and back to the boy.
                                BUTCH
                       (as if he hasn't
                        seen him in years)
               Phillip?....
                                                      (CONTINUED)

      Phillip, momentarily dazed, stares at the gun in his hand,
      at Butch, the blood pouring from Butch's side, and the
      shocked faces of Mack and his family. Then, in a flash, he
      runs, pell-mell, out of the house.
185   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             185
      Phillip blasts out the screen door and runs straight to the
      well.
      He drops the gun into the well, catches his breath and heads
      for the road.
      After a few yards he has a thought, runs back to the
      station wagon, grabs the keys and throws them as far into
      the adjacent field as he can. Then he resumes his race for
      the road.
186   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                             186
      Butch gropes to his feet, still in shock. He stumbles
      toward the door, then stops, reaches in his pocket,
      extracts Mack's Barlow knife, holds it up and walks toward
      them, staring hard.
      Mack, Cleve, Lottie -- Afraid they'll be killed after all.
      Butch, surprisingly, meekly sets the knife down on the
      coffee table...
                                 BUTCH
                Thanks for yer' hospitality.
      And walks away.
187   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             187

      Butch emerges and stumbles out.
                                 BUTCH
                        (to the horizon)
                Phillip?!...
      No answer. He drags himself to the station wagon and, with
      much effort, slides himself into the seat. No keys. He
      opens the door, crawls out, leaving a trail of blood, looks
      out to the road and starts to walk.
      PHILLIP
      runs down the road, looking back every so often to see if
      Butch is following
                                                   (CONTINUED)

      BUTCH
      makes his way onto the private dirt and starts walking back
      toward the main road.
                                 BUTCH
                       (yelling)
               Phillip?!! I won't hurt ya', I swear!
      PHILLIP
      is running out of steam on the road ahead.   He stops for a
      blow and looks back.
      HIS POV

      A few hundred yards back, Butch struggles forward.
      BACK TO SCENE
      Phillip crawls through the ditch beside the road and
      squeezes through a barb wire fence.
      His costume hangs on a barb. He rips away from the fence
      leaving a foot-long strand behind.
      In the b.g. -- a pickup truck drives by.
188   INT. TRUCK - DAY                                              188
      ARCH ANDREWS, 50, the owner of the Ranch, slows down when
      he sees...
                                    ARCH
                What the hell?...
      HIS POV - PHILLIP

      clad in his white costume, running across a field toward
      a grove of trees beside the creek.
      BACK TO SCENE
      Arch continues on down the road and passes...
      Butch -- nearly in shock, stumbling down the road.
      TRUCK
      pulls into Mack's place, and Arch gets out, peers into the
      station wagon, sees blood, grimaces and walks up to the
      house. He notices a dripping trail of blood on the porch.

                                                                122.
189   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                                189
      Arch enters the kitchen, sees no one and starts toward the
      living room. The MAMBO continues to SCRATCH.
                                ARCH
               Mack?... Lottie?...
      Arch enters the living room and stops when he sees Mack and
      family, still gagged and tied to the chairs.
190   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                 190
      Butch, holding his side, the pain is worse as he stumbles
      along.
      He stops when he spots something -- a piece of white
      costume on the fence. He crosses the ditch, steps through
      the fence and walks in the same direction Phillip did.
                                BUTCH
               That was a helluva' thing to do, Phillip.
               You're a hero. Prolly' be in all the
               papers tomorrow, how you saved those
               folks. Truth is, I don't think I woulda'
               killed 'em. I only killed two people in
               my whole life. One hurt my mama and one
               hurt you.

      Butch follows Phillip's path through the field.
                                 BUTCH
                What say we talk this over? Settle
                things man to man. Then we can be on
                our way. I'll even let you drive. Knock
                that right off yer' list. How'd that be?
      PHILLIP
      finally arrives at the creek, looking over   his shoulder all
      the way. He looks at the water -- deep and    running swift.
      Where to go? He decides and heads for the    nearest tree --
      a big oak, and shimmies up to a branch ten   feet or so above
      the ground.

                                                                124.

      A country cop answering the report, drives slowly down the
      road, his pistol drawn and held upright in one hand. He
      pulls into Mack's driveway and parks. Arch walks out of
      the house to greet him.
                                ARCH
                That's his car. Took off on foot. He's
                got a pistol. Mack says it looks like a
                .38.

      Butch stops to rest.   Something catches his eye.
      HIS POV

      A white figure moves slightly in the boughs of an oak tree.
      Phillip tries to climb higher but can't reach the next limb.
      BACK TO SCENE
      Butch walks underneath the tree without even looking at
      Phillip. He sits down to rest.
                                    BUTCH
                Alaska, Phillip.     Wild and wooley. Man
                against nature.     Me personally, I like
                them odds.
                        (beat)
                Did I tell you my   daddy lives there?
                He's the one that   sent the picture
                postcard. Listen    here to what he says
                about it...
      Butch pulls the postcard from his back pocket and reads...

                                  BUTCH
                        (reading)
                'Dear Robert'... that's my real name,
                Phillip. Robert. Jus' like old Bob the
                family man. 'Dear Robert, I just wanted
                to tell you that me leaving has nothing
                to do with you.'
      Phillip, still afraid, can't help but listen as Butch
      suffers through his memories.

               Someday you can come and visit and we'll
               maybe get to know each other better.'
               Short and sweet. That's the old man's
               style. 'Cold all the time' -- like that's
               a big sellin' point.
      He laughs to himself.
                                BUTCH
               He useta' pat me on the head and tell
               folks 'that it's some that can live life
               without askin' about it and it's others
               has to know why, and this boy here is
               one of the latters.'
                       (beat)
               That's why I wanted to go up there. To
               visit the old man, I guess. Prolly'
               punch him one first, but then maybe we'd
               end up bein' friends, sit down, have a
               beer, talk things over....
      Butch groans. He pulls his hand from his side. Blood is
      oozing all over the place. He returns the postcard to
      his pocket.
                                BUTCH
               We'll jus' rest awhile. Then you
               can make up yer' mind. How's that?
      Phillip, still clinging to the tree, can't help but feel
      compassion for his friend.
195   EXT. MACK'S HOUSE - DAY                                      195
      A dozen Highway Patrol cars now sit in the driveway. The
      Fed in charge, AGENT HENDRICKS, assigns different officers
      to secure the area in an incredibly organized fashion.
      Mack, Lottie, Cleve and Arch watch from the porch.
196   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                         196
      Butch's eyes are closed. A small puddle of blood drips
      and becomes a rivulet running down into the creek.
      Phillip, still in the tree, still watching, can't bear it
      any longer. He slowly climbs down and drops next to Butch,
      who opens his eyes to the boy and smiles.
                                BUTCH
               One thing's for sure now -- I definitely
               believe in ghosts.

               I know ya' are. Truth is, if it had to
               happen, I'm glad it was you. As opposed
               to someone I don't know, I mean. All
               things considered, I feel pretty good,
               though. Could use a beer, though.

                                 PHILLIP
               You better run.
                                BUTCH
               Naw, Phillip, I need me a time machine
               with a loud radio to take me where I'm
               goin'. Walkin's for squares.
199   EXT. MACK'S HOUSE - DAY                                       199
      Red exits his patrol car, followed by Sally.     Agent
      Hendricks walks up.
                                HENDRICKS
               Garnett, I'm Tom Hendricks, F.B.I., out
               of the Amarillo office. I understand you
               have one of our men with you?

                                 RED
               Yeah.   You got the area quadroned off?
                                HENDRICKS
               Water tight. Like a frog's pussy.
                       (notices Sally)
               Sorry, ma'am.
                                SALLY
               No doubt an observation based on personal
               experience.
      Red can't help but smile.
                                RED
               You got him spotted?
                                HENDRICKS
               By the creek, half-mile down the road.
               I spaced officers in a circle around them
               100 yards or so away.
                                RED
               You got any problem with me handling this
               one?
                                HENDRICKS
               What say we both handle it?
      Red sighs.
                                RED
               Let's head on down there.     Bradley, gimme'
               a megaphone.
                                HENDRICKS
               One other thing, Chief. Haynes is wounded.
               The boy gut-shot him.
                                   RED
               Yer' shittin' me.

      Phillip scoops a handful of water and brings it to Butch,
      who opens his mouth and drinks, A megaphoned voice
      interrupts...
                                RED (V.O.)
                       (through megaphone)
               Butch, this is Red Garnett of the
               Texas State Police.
      A thin, knowing smile crosses Butch's lips.

               I know yer' hurt. We've got damn near
               100 armed men here. Take a look around
               and you'll see I'm shootin' ya' straight.
                                BUTCH
                       (yelling back)
               All this for me. I'm touched, but I'm
               afraid ya'll gonna' have to back it up a
               step or two. I'm headed to Mexico.
                       (to Phillip)
               Lyin' to 'em, of course.
201   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                        201

      Red leans against a patrol car, accompanied closely by Adler,
      Sally and Hendricks.
                                   RED
                          (into megaphone)
               Hate    to tell ya', Butch, but yer' headed
               the    wrong direction. Tell ya' what.
               You    let the boy go and we'll talk about
               it.     Discuss it over a cold beer.

               Beer. What'd I tell ya'.
                       (to Red)
               Appreciate the offer, Cap'n, but ya'
               know I can't do that. If you and yer'
               pals back outta' here, I'll drop the boy
               at the border.
                       (beat)
               If you don't I'll shoot him in the
               head. I mean it!
      Phillip, betrayed beyond comprehension, stares at Butch.
                                BUTCH
                       (to Phillip)
               Don't look at me like that. I don't
               even have a gun. What did ya' do with
               the pistola' anyway?
                                PHILLIP
               Threw it in the well.
                                   BUTCH
               Good thinkin'.

               Ya' think he means it?
      Red mulls it over, replaces his old chaw with a fresh one
      and looks to Sally.
                                RED
               What do you think?
                                SALLY
               Based on what's happened the past two
               days I don't think he would.
                                 RED
               One thing's for sure. If he gets outta'
               here with the boy, we're right back to
               where we started.
                                BRADLEY
               If he kills the boy he'll get the chair.
                                ADLER
               Shit, he'll get the chair anyway.   He's
               killed two in two days.
                                SALLY
               We don't know that he pulled the trigger
               on either of the innocent victims.
                                ADLER
               Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-O-
               Lounger. 'Sides, who killed Pugh?
               Casper?
                                RED
               All right, both of you, that's enough!
               From the trail of blood I got a feelin'
               it ain't gonna' make any difference.
               Let's jus' concentrate on gettin' the
               boy out for now.
      Bobby Lee approaches with a leather case, bypasses Red and
      goes straight to Hendricks.
                                BOBBY LEE
               Where ya' want me, sir?
                                RED

               That'd be the boy's mother.

               Butch, we got the boy's Mama here.
               She wants to say something.
      Phillip is visibly stunned by the news. He crawls up to
      the crest of the creekside and squints, looking for his
      mom.
                                BUTCH
               What's wrong, Phillip?

               It's my mama.
      Phillip still cranes his neck to see.

                                BUTCH
               Now that ya' got yerself a ghost suit,
               do ya' think she'll let ya' trick r'

                       (better than none)
               I got to do one house.
      Butch smiles.   He has an idea.
                                BUTCH
               Put yer' mask back on.

      and opens it on the hood of the patrol car.

      Inside is... a high-powered military rifle in three parts.
      Hands unzip a velvetine bag and pull out a high-powered
      scope.
      Bobby Lee holds the lens of the scope to his mouth, blows a
      breath on it and wipes it clean with a piece of clean
      cloth. He feels eyes and turns to see...
      Sally, watching him at work.
      Bobby Lee smiles at her, cocksure.   His dark role in this
      manhunt is now perfectly clear.
      Sally turns her head, disgusted.

      Gladys Perry, frazzled, somewhat in shock, is ushered
      forward. She's handed the MEGAPHONE. She fumbles with it,
      pushes the button. It SQUAWKS LOUDLY.
                                RED
               Jus' push the button and talk normal.
      It SQUAWKS again.

               I can. Please, I want to take my boy
               home! I want to...
      The MEGAPHONE SQUALKS one final dying time and SHORTS OUT.
      Red hands it to Bradley, who immediately sets it on the
      trunk and starts taking it apart.
                                RED
                       (to Gladys)

      mints, anything from the surrounding officers.

               Don't have another megaphone, Chief.

                       (yells)
               One more thing. His old lady has to
               swear to take him trick r 'treatin'
               every year.
      Phillip strains to look for his mom.    He's upset, ready to
      leave.
                                BUTCH
               Gimme' yer' list, Phillip.
                                  PHILLIP
               Butch?...
                                  BUTCH
               Gimme that list.
      Phillip pulls it out. Butch snatches it and reads it to
      himself, laughing. He's on a death roll of sorts, between
      losing blood and being in an impossible situation he almost
      seems to be enjoying the macabre scenario as it unfolds.
      Phillip, on the other hand, is beginning to sob.
                                BUTCH
                       (yells)
               And she's gotta promise to take him to
               the fair for rollercoasters and cotton
               candy whenever he wants... or at least
               once a year...
                                PHILLIP
               I wanna' go home!...

               And when he gets older he gets to drink
               beer...

               And to go out on dates with girls!

               Not on the list, but you'll thank me
               later for that little addition.

               Done that, got to drive, gonna' ride that
               rocketship. That's about it.

               She's gotta' promise or I won't let him
               go!
                                PHILLIP
               I wanna' go home, Butch. My mama's not
               bad! She gives me those things.

      Red, exasperated, he can't believe how weird this has
      gotten.

               Make her say it!
      Red looks to Gladys as if to say, "go ahead".   She seems
      reluctant. Red's frustration is showing.
210   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                         210
      Phillip is near tears.
      He rises and starts to move for the field, but Butch grabs
      him with one arm, pulls him close and holds him like he's
      his own child.
                                PHILLIP
               I jus' wanna' go home.

               Phillip knows those things are against
               our beliefs.

               She's a real good mama.
      Butch reaches into his pocket, extracts the remaining wad
      of stolen bills, unzips the Casper outfit, stuffs them
      into the costume and rezips.
                                BUTCH
                       (to Phillip)
               When you get home, hide this. If
               she's lyin' you can buy yer' own damn
               beer.
      Phillip quiets for a moment and stares at Butch.

               Yer' not bad, are you, Butch?

               step out there real slow, keepin' yer'
               paws in the air. Then strut right over

      Butch nudges Phillip and the boy starts toward the field.

      Phillip reaches level ground and for the first time sees
      the full strength of the amassed police forces -- at least
      20 cars, swirling lights, guns everywhere, pointing at him.

               Call for yer' boy to come!
      Gladys, near shock, AD LIBS commands to Phillip. "Come on
      honey," "Phillip, keep walking," that kind of thing.
      (NOTE: Her commands become more and more shrieking and
      frantic and continue throughout, giving rise to even more
      confusion than is already present.)

      Phillip turns back and sees ...
      Butch -- He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for
      it, but his strength is gone. He collapses.
      Phillip, standing still, with his mother's shrieks filling
      the air behind him, watches Butch for a second then runs
      back toward him.

               Personally I think we negotiated a pretty

      Butch smiles.
                                BUTCH
               If I had a pistola I'd be headed the
               other direction. My partner here got rid
               of the evidence.
                       (beat)
               Do I know you, friend?
                                   RED
               No... not really.
                                BUTCH
               Hmm. Well, look I wanna' talk to the boy
               and then we'll take care of bidness. How's
               that? Only take a second.
      Red nods then looks over his shoulder at the patrol cars
      lined up like a wagon train, guns aimed, Bobby Lee peering
      through the scope of his rifle.

               He's stopped.
                                ADLER
               He's gonna make a run for it.

      Butch kneels down beside Phillip.    He reaches slowly, pain-
      fully for his back pocket.
                                  BUTCH
                 Mebe' someday you'll get to go...

      Hendricks looks through the binocs.
                                  HENDRICKS
                 He's goin' for his weapon!
      THROUGH BINOCULARS

      Butch reaches into his back pocket...
      IN FIELD
      Red squints to make out what Butch's reaching for.
      HIS POV
      Butch smiles as he retrieves the POSTCARD from his pocket.
      BACK TO SCENE
      A look of concern crosses Red's lips...
      ROADSIDE
      Sally realizes it's not a gun that Butch is reaching for.
                                  SALLY
                 Noooooo...!!!!

      FINGER ON TRIGGER
      squeezes -- An EXPLOSION followed by a RINGING ECHO.
      IN FIELD
      Butch's chest explodes when the bullet hits him. He rocks
      backwards, still on his knees... and looks at Phillip in
      amazement.
      Phillip screams, grabs Butch and holds him up.
      THROUGH CROSSHAIRS OF GUN
      Phillip is obscuring a second shot at Butch.
      BUTCH
      tastes blood and sighs.

                 Damn, Buzz, shot twice in the same day.
      He collapses and falls into Phillip's arms. Phillip backs
      away two steps and falls to his knees. Butch wavers for a
      second then topples on his back.
      Phillip moans, sobs, as he watches Butch, the GUNSHOT still
      ECHOING.
      AT ROADSIDE
      Gladys runs from behind the car, followed by a host of
      officers.

                                  HENDRICKS
                 Keep everybody back!
      Bobby Lee stands, lowers his rifle disengages and smiles at
      Hendricks.
                                     BOBBY LEE
                 No need to worry.     He can't hurt nobody
                 now.
      IN FIELD
      Red stands frozen, staring, in another world. An OFFICER
      trots up to Butch and does a careful ground frisk.
                                   OFFICER
                         (calls back)
                 No weapon, Chief!
      Red "comes to," turns and walks toward the...

      ROADSIDE
      Red walks   up to Bobby Lee, stops and stares at the grinning
      marksman.    After a beat, Red turns then nearly jumps out of
      shoes with   a sudden right cross that floors the younger man.
      Red starts   to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps
      in, grabs   Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the
      older man   back. Shouting, i.e. "Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa!"
      Red settles a bit. Hendricks turns to Bobby Lee who rises
      to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and then to Red who
      is still breathing hard.
                                  HENDRICKS
                 What the hell was that all about?!

      Red turns and walks away. Hendricks throws his hat to the
      ground, kicks it and follows Red with his eyes...
                                 HENDRICKS
                        (to no one/everyone)
                Goddammit!!
      Adler catches up to Red.   He stares at his old friend and
      boss as they walk along.
                                 ADLER
                I thought he had a gun, too, Red.   There
                was just no way of knowin'.
      Red doesn't even look at Adler, just keeps walking.    Adler
      stops, his eyes following Red.
      Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away.
      PHILLIP
      is helped to his feet by his mother. She holds him dearly
      to her chest. He hugs back just as hard, his blood-stained
      Casper outfit staining her blouse. She unzips the costume
      and dollar bills fly all around. She starts to lead
      Phillip off but he won't leave until...
      He pulls the postcard from Butch's hand.
      CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
      Staring down at Butch.
      CLOSEUP - BUTCH
      His eyes flutter a bit with recognition.

      AT PATROL CAR
      Red leans against the car.   After a few seconds Sally walks
      up and finds a spot a few feet down from him where she, too,
      leans against the car. After a few more seconds.
                                 SALLY
                You did everything you could.    You know
                that.
      Red just stares straight ahead.
                                 RED
                I don't know nuthin'.   Not a damn thing.

      Red reaches into his pocket, pulls out his tobacco and
      stuffs a chunk into his mouth.
      IN FIELD - CLOSEUP - BUTCH
      He licks his lips as the MUFFLED VOICES CONTINUE around
      him. He squints hard and sees:
      HELICOPTER
      as it lifts off and speeds away.    As it wipes the sun...
      CLOSEUP - BUTCH
      A slight smile crosses his dying face as he squints to
      see Phillip's flight.
      CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
      Nose pressed against the glass bubble.
      BUTCH
      His eyes don't close, still squinted but frozen.

      We realize now, are lifeless.

          EXT. FARMLAND - DAWN
          
          IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down       
          the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
          The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
          Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
          and through a massive field of emptiness.
          
          The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
          GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
          AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
          the car.
          
          Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
          General scans his surroundings with concern.
          
          TITLE CARD UP: THE PAST                                      
          
          Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL
          HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and
          into the earth.
          
          
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          They descend a metal staircase and walk with great
          urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a
          hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing
          in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading
          them across the room.
          
                                 GENERAL BRAT
                    When did it start?
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.
          
          
          INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way
          mirror.
          
          On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several
          archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject
          on the other side of the mirror.
          
          The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits
          at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises
          his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT.
          
                                                                    2
          
          
          He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts
          into a coughing fit.
          
          The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their
          devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black
          Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a
          cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone
          in the corner.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                           (into microphone)
                    Private Miller, we are now going to ask
                    you several questions. How do you feel?
          
          His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side
          of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone.
          
                                  PRIVATE MILLER
                    Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But...
                    It's good. Good queer.
                           (beat)
                    Sir. Good queer, Sir.
          
          The scientists scribble madly. One of them mumbles into
          General Brat's ear.
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D)
                    But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir,
                    I should mention that I'm also feeling
                    quite gay...so, a little queer, but
                    mostly gay.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    Private Miller. When you think of your
                    superiors, what emotions do you feel?
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                           (holding out the joint)
                    This went out...Sir.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    We will send someone in. Now answer the
                    question.
          
          A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out
          wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old
          fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door
          that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private,
          who looks at him in shock.
          
                                 SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)
                           (through speakers)
                    Private Miller? Answer the question.
          
                                                                     3
          
          
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                    Oh...um...what was the question again?
          
          The Agent in the strange suit reaches the private and
          holds a lighter up to the joint.
          
                                 SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                           (through speakers)
                    What are your emotions towards your
                    superiors?
          
          Miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. The
          Agent exits the room.
          
                                  PRIVATE MILLER
                     COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit.
                           (beat)
                    Well, now that I think of it, it's
                    strange that they are called my
                    `superiors'. Does that make me their
                    `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked
                    up.
          
          General Brat scowls.
          
                                 GENERAL BRAT
                           (curtly to the scientists)
                    I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the
                    hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him.
                    This never happened.
          
          Instantly, the scientists start packing up their
          equipment. Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED
          PHONE and dials. Two Agents in the scuba-like suits
          emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging
          him away.

          DALE DENTON (late 20s, out of shape, slightly unkempt)
          looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits       
          in his cluttered and worn old lady car. He smokes a joint       
          while listening to talk radio.                                  
          
                                 TALK RADIO DJ                            
                    Well, let's look at the facts.                        
                    Financially, coins are better because                 
                    they're cheaper, and environmentally,                 
                    forget-about-it, coins win hands down.                
                    For those just joining us, we're with                 
                    caller Dale Denton discussing if America              
                    should lose the paper dollar bill.                    
          
          We see that Dale has a wireless ear piece in.                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of             
                    coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants,             
                    clangs around. With all this unnecessary              
                    new security everywhere, we'll be setting             
                    off alarms left and right!

                    We certainly do, Mr. Denton. Crude, but               
                    to the point. Next caller!                            
          
          Dale puts away his phone and pulls up in front of a nice        
          house.

          Dale, wearing a name tag that reads "Garth", holding a          
          clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat, knocks                 
          repeatedly on the door. A woman cautiously answers the          
          door.

          Dale shoves an envelope into her hand.                          
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up             
                    to your divorce proceedings 4 times under

          Dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to        
          open the envelope.

          Dale is driving and smoking a joint. He looks at his            
          check list - it is a list of people he served that day.         
          He's only got a few left. He listens to a different talk        
          radio dj while playing music from a tiny iPod boom box          
          that sits in his passenger seat.

          His iPod starts playing HOT STEPPA by INI KAMOZE.               
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)

          Dale turns down the talk radio and puffs away at his            
          joint; he enthusiastically dances in his car while              
          singing along.

          Dale, wearing a Zerox hat, walks into the building.             
          
                                 SECRETARY

          The secretary nods and goes back to her work. Dale              
          casually waltzes down the office halls looking at the           
          names on the doors. He glances down at his clipboard, it        
          read: Walter Tandum.                                            
          
          He finds the office and knocks on the door.

          Dale enters to see Walter, a 40 year old accountant,            
          seated at his desk.

          Dale turns and walks away. As he does, he notices a small       
          kitchen. He enters and is delighted at the array of             
          snacks and beverages. He helps himself.

          The receptionist immediately picks up the phone.

          DR. TERRENCE runs towards reception, where Dale is still        
          waiting.

                    Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who                
                    repeatedly refused to take care of the

          Dale hits a pipe. It is clear he strongly disagrees with        
          what the DJ is saying.

          We see his ear piece and hear that he is on hold.

          Dale, wearing a chauffeur hat, stands by the main               
          entrance holding a sign that reads: JOSH CORBER. A man          
          walks out of the hotel and, seeing the sign, approaches         
          Dale.
          
                                 CORBER                                   
                    My name's Corber.                                     
          
                                 DALE
                    You're Joshua Aaron Corber?                           
          
                                 CORBER                                   
                           (overjoyed)
                    Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't
                    she? I was just telling her before I left
                    how I've never been in a limo. Can you
                    believe it? 35 and I've never been in a
                    limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?
          
          Dale hands him a BLUE ENVELOPE.
          
                                 DALE
                    Sorry, but you've been served.
          
          Dale walks away. CORBER opens the envelope and reads it.        
          
                                 CORBER

          Dale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and          
          walks out of the airport. Then, a huge smile comes across
          his face. He has noticed a nearby Burger King.
          
                                 DALE
                           (excited)
                    Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.
          
          He happily walks toward the food.
          
          
          INT - DALE'S CAR - DAY
          
          Dale sits in his car   outside a high school. An array of        
          Burger King wrappers   surrounds him as he rolls a joint         
          with the last of his   weed on top of a Batman comic. He         
          lights the joint and   turns on the radio.                       
          
                                 RADIO DJ                                  
                    ...3:09 in the PM and we-                              
          
          Dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then          
          snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather           
          kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand           
          sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash           
          and breath mints.                                                
          
          Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet        
          naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in        
          his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all          
          over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes.         
          He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some             
          cologne, and then gets out of the car.

          Dale walks towards the school.

          Dale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend,         
          ANGIE ANDERSON, walking towards him with her group of

                    fine with it. They just want to meet you

                    I'm not dating you just because you're

          look.                                                           
          
                                 MR. EDWARDS                              
                    This is your boyfriend? How old are you,              
                    30?                                                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    24.                                                   
          
                                 MR. EDWARDS                              
                    And you're dating an 18 year old?                     
          
                                 ANGIE                                    
                    I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.                    
          
          Dale doesn't know what to make of Mr. Edwards comments          
          and looks.                                                      
          
                                 MR. EDWARDS                              
                    Alright, well this school is for students             
                    and faculty only. Friends can't just stop             
                    by.                                                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Dude, you may be a teacher here, but                  
                    we're about the same age, so don't get                
                    all high and mighty. It's not that weird.             
                    Frankly, it's natural.                                
          
                                                                    12
          
          
          
                                 MR. EDWARDS                              
                    Well, in that case, get off school                    
                    property or I'm calling the Police                    
                    Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to                 
                    you, but if this guy's dating someone                 
                    your age, it's because nobody his age                 
                    will date him.                                        
          
          Then, four HANDSOME AND FIT STUDENTS walk by.                   
          
                                 HANDSOME STUDENT                         
                    Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama                
                    today.                                                
          
          Angie smiles at the guys. Dale doesn't like how all this        
          is going down.                                                  
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    I'll wait in the car.                                 
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER                                 
          
          Dale and Angie sit in the parked car making out.                
          
                                 ANGIE                                    
                    So, do you want to get some food?                     
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    No...actually I can't. I have to go serve             
                    a guy.                                                
          
                                 ANGIE                                    
                    Now?                                                  
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang                
                    out later though. You can come over.                  
          
                                 ANGIE                                    
                    We'll see if Neo is truly the one.                    
                                                                          
          
          They share a long kiss, and Angie gets out of the car.          
          Dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone       
          and hits speed dial.
          
                                 SAUL (O.S.)
                           (over phone)
                    Yo?
          
                                                                 13
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick
                    up some shit?
          
          
          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two
          joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia
          are scattered all over the coffee table. A large
          "Scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. There is a
          knock at the door and Dale enters.
          
                                 DALE
                    What's up, Saul.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (unpleasantly surprised)
                    What the fuck?!?
          
                                 DALE
                    What?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did
                    you get in here?
          
                                 DALE
                    Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me
                    in. I-
          
                                 SAUL
                    That's fucked up, man! This building is
                    filled with fuckin' assholes. What else
                    is the buzzer for? Fuck.
          
                                 DALE
                    I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry.          
                    I'm just not familiar with your,                   
                    uh...protocol yet.                                 
          
                                 SAUL
                    Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro.           
                    We're always cool. It's those fuckin'
                    jaggoffs.
          
                                 DALE
                    Um...sure.
          
          Dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch.
          
                                                                    14
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Brass tacs. I've got this new bud.
                    Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but
                    fortunately, it's hands down the dopest
                    fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've
                    smoked some dope fuckin' shit.
          
                                 DALE
                    Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue
                    Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had
                    a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest
                    Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso
                    Snowflake had a baby, and then by some
                    miracle those babies met, and fucked -
                    then this would be the shit they'd birth.
          
          Saul pulls out a big bag of weed. He places it on the
          coffee table as though it was his child. He pulls out a
          large bud.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Smell it.
          
          Dale takes the weed and looks at it. It looks
          spectacular. Bright red hairs and large crystals, huge
          purple and blue leaves - just spectacular! Dale smells it
          and is taken aback.
          
                                 DALE
                    What is this? It's spectacular.
          
                                 SAUL
                    It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red
                    told me it's when this Hawaiian flood
                    takes special dirt to the weed or some
                    shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the
                    only guy in the whole city who has it.
                    And, its only ten bones more for a
                    quarter.
          
                                 DALE
                    So...can I get a quarter?
          
                                 SAUL
                    No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
          
          Saul walks into another room. Dale looks around
          anxiously; he clearly wants to go.                              
          
                                                                    15
          
          
          
          A moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits
          down. Dale notices that he didn't bring anything back
          from the other room. Saul notices Dale looking at him
          strangely.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    What's with the look? What?
          
                                 DALE
                    Where's the scale?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
          
          Saul hustles into the other room.
          
                                  SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           (from other room)
                    You know what's weird? How sometimes,
                    your brain just chooses to like, not keep
                    things in it, you know?
                           (beat)
                    Fucking scale.
                           (beat)
                    Shit. Where is it?
          
          Dale checks his watch and then looks at the door;
          suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross-
          joint Saul was constructing.
          
                                 DALE
                    Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
          
          Saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on
          the coffee table.
          
                                 SAUL
                            (nonchalantly)
                    Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen
                    one of these? Not surprising. They are,
                    like, the apex of the vortex of joint
                    engineering. NASA built the first one in              
                    the eighties.                                         
          
          Saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the         
          scale.
          
                                 DALE
                    You can actually smoke that contraption?
          
          Saul puts Dale's weed in a baggie.
          
                                                                    16
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    You light all three ends at the same
                    time, then, you smoke it as it resonates
                    the main section, creating a "trifecta"
                    of smoking power. It's like, three times
                    as powerful as a normal joint.
          
          Dale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed.
          Dale lingers for a moment.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, be careful with that thing.
          
          Dale gets up and heads to the door.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with
                    me?
          
          Dale turns around. He clearly wants to smoke it, but he
          tries to play it cool.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    I can't even light it on my own.
          
          Dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl.
          
                                 DALE
                           (excited)
                    Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what
                    do I do?
          
          Saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Alright. Firstly you light these two
                    ends. Then I will light the tip, making
                    the trifecta complete. Are you ready?
          
          Dale nods and they light the joint. Saul tokes hard;
          plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a COUGHING
          FIT.
          
                                 DALE
                    Holy...
          
          Dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a
          coughing fit.
          
                                 SAUL
                    It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It
                    opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you
                    twenty-five percent higher.
                                 (MORE)
          
                                                                   17
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    And that, combined with the pineapple
                    weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're
                    a good thirty to forty times higher. I
                    don't know the exact math, but, pff,
                    you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You
                    know what I mean?
          
          Saul takes a toke. Dale coughs HARDER and HARDER. He
          seems like he might throw up.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It's crazy. The better the weed, the more
                    I wish I could think of how to explain
                    what's so good about it, but the...uh,
                    the better it is, the less shit I can
                    think of in total, you know?                         
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all
          over his suit. Slightly agitated, Dale brushes it off.
          
                                  SAUL (CONT'D)                          
                    Okay, so, like, you've been buying from
                    me for, like, a few months now and I
                    really gotta ask.
                           (beat)
                    What's with the suit?
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm a process server.
          
                                 SAUL
                    You`re a servant? Like, a butler.
          
                                 DALE
                    No, process server.
          
          Saul looks confused.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    I'm hired to give people papers they                 
                    don't want. It's pretty much the easiest
                    job on earth.                                        
          
                                 SAUL
                    Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?
          
          Dale takes a big hit from the joint.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree
                    two years ago, then I did nothing for a
                    year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked
                    me up.                                               
          
                                                                 18
          
          
          
          They both revel in the thought.                              
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)                         
                    I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I            
                    smoked like five joints, gave out some             
                    pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger             
                    King-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Hey man, did you get those new chicken
                    fries?
          
          Dale passes the join to Saul.
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're
                    fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot-              
                    boxed my car and then...got some action            
                    from my girlfriend.                                
          
          Saul laughs at this.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Does she smoke pot?
          
                                 DALE
                    A little. She's in high school.                    
          
                                 SAUL
                    That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're          
                    like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his              
                    biography.                                         
          
                                 DALE                                  
                    No, no. She's 19.                                  
          
                                 SAUL                                  
                           (dissappointed)                             
                    Oh. It's still cool I guess.                       
          
                                 DALE                                  
                    Yeah, it's awesome, although I think               
                    she's getting old enough where she's               
                    realizing I don't do much. And these high          
                    school guys these days. They're all                
                    roided out and going to Harvard. Even on           
                    my best days, I look like a fat, dumb              
                    piece of shit next to them.                        
          
                                 SAUL                                  
                    Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it           
                    pretty good. I wish I had a job that               
                    easy. Fuck.

                                 DALE                                   
                    Dude...you've got, like, the actual                 
                    easiest job in the world.                           
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    Hey! You're right, man. I never thought             
                    of it like that.                                    
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    You can actually do whatever the hell you           
                    want. You get to sleep all day and people           
                    come buy weed at night.                             
          
          Dale passes Saul the joint.                                   
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    That's totally true. Except tomorrow.               
                    Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I            
                    gotta go change my grandma's clocks
                    forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't
                    figure it out.
          
                                 DALE
                    Sorry to hear that.
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yo, so, like, what have these people done
                    that you go after?
          
                                 DALE
                    Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
          
          Dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a
                    Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in
                    town. Maybe it's him!
          
                                 DALE
                    I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot
                    of Ted Joneses's out there.                         
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's
                    what I want to be one day. He's like the
                    "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like
                    Jah. Or Scarface.
          
                                                                    20
          
          
          
          Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After
          a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a
          conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in
          awkward silence. Dale gets up.                                  
          
                                 DALE
                    Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.
          
                                 SAUL
                    No worries dude, peace.
          
          They slap each other five and Dale exits. Saul turns on
          the TV. Saved By the Bell is on. It makes Saul chuckle.
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house.
          It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale        
          parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off
          the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH!        
          Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a         
          COP CAR!
          
          He sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the
          cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! The
          FEMALE COP walks up the block - TOWARDS DALE'S CAR!
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Oh shit on me.                                        
          
          Fortunately,   the COP crosses the street and walks towards     
          Ted's house.   Confused, Dale watches as she is let in.         
          Dale waits a   moment and then re-lights the joint. He          
          tries to see   into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOKE.
          
          BANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house.
          Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he
          focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes
          are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and          
          crashes through the front window!                               
          
          Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the
          Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM!          
          BLAM! Blood splatters!                                          
          
          Dale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car
          and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He
          smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks
          the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse
          - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still
          hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away!                        
          
                                                                    21
          
          
          
          The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the
          house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish
          into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired
          Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He
          lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S
          ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips           
          open the paper and examines the weed closely.

          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Saul is laying on his couch watching Saved By the Bell,
          laughing so hard that he's crying.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.                                  
          
          Suddenly, the BUZZER sounds repeatedly.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                           (mumbles)
                    Fucking hell.
          
          He grudgingly walks to the intercom and presses talk.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          He presses listen.
          
                                 DALE (O.C.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me
                    in! It's Dale! Let m--
          
          Saul casually presses the talk button.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (annoyingly casual)
                    Denton? Dale Denton?
          
          He smiles to himself, then presses listen.
          
                                 DALE (O.C.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea-
          
          Annoyed, Saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door.
          
                                                                   22
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                           (to himself)
                    ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you
                    can't handle it.
          
          A moment later, Dale, completely freaking out, BURSTS
          through the door and SLAMS it shut.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)

                                 DALE
                    He fucking killed him, man!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-
          
                                 DALE
                           (quietly)
                    He killed him!
          
                                  SAUL
                           (loud)
                    Somebody killed somebody?!?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A
                    lady, and a guy.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! A guy!
          
                                 SAUL
                    A cop killed a guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy!
                    The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking
                    woman, a police woman, and   an old guy,
                    shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking
                    window at Ted's house!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Was the guy Ted?
          
                                 DALE
                    Which guy?
          
                                                                 23
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know, the old guy who shot the
                    guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't fucking know. He was this big,
                    old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he
                    fucking took him, and he shot him! Right
                    there in the fucking window! BAM!
          
                                 SAUL
                    I heard Ted's got grey hair!
          
                                 DALE
                    And they saw me! They saw me see them
                    shoot the guy!
          
          Saul jumps to his feet.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did
                    you come here? Did they follow you?!?
          
          Saul dashes to the window and peeks out.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Did they follow you here!?!
          
                                 DALE
                    No! I panicked. I was having a coughing
                    fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car.
                    Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at
                    least. They knew someone was there.
          
                                 SAUL
                    But they don't know it's you?
          
                                 DALE
                    No. I don't think so. No.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So...they're not coming here?
          
          Dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. Saul shrugs,
          sits back down, then picks up his joint and re-lites it.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You
                    gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd
                    appreciate it if you left my shit out of
                    this shit.
          
                                                                   24
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm not calling the cops - one of them
                    was a cop. They could all be cops!                   
          
                                 SAUL
                    Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. I saw some blood.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I wonder who the guy he shot was?
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't know, who do drug dealers kill?
                    It was probably another drug dealer. He
                    was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers.
          
                                  SAUL
                    Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up
                    with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit.
                    They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two
                    in town.
                           (beat)
                    Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo,
                    you want some of this?
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint. Dale takes the joint and           
          frantically smokes as he paces.                                
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                           
                    So, like, exactly what was the sequence
                    of happenings?
          
                                 DALE                                    
                    I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a
                    massive joint of that weed you sold me-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare
                    it's almost a shame to smoke it, like
                    killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.              
          
                                 DALE
                    When I threw it...out...the window...                
          
          Dale stops pacing and stares at Saul. He then looks down       
          at the joint of pineapple weed. Saul notices wheels
          turning in Dale's head.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What?
          
                                                                  25
          
          
          
          Dale continues staring at the joint.
          
                                 DALE
                    This weed is actually that rare?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (proudly)
                    Yeah, it's like, "the rarest".
          
                                 DALE
                    So, you are actually the only guy in town
                    with this weed?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was
                    giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".
          
                                 DALE
                    And am I the only guy you gave it to?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yeah. So, we're the only guys.
          
                                 DALE
                    But, like, another dealer, couldn't
                    identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if
                    they found a roach of it, right?
          
          Saul thinks for a moment.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I could. Why?
          
                                 DALE
                           (panicking)
                    We should go, we shouldn't be here! We
                    should go!
          
                                 SAUL
                    No...seriously, why?
          
                                 DALE
                    I left a roach of this weed in front of
                    Ted's house!
          
                                 SAUL
                    So what? I leave roaches all over fucking
                    town.
          
                                                                    26
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    No, listen - they could find the roach
                    and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's
                    the only guy in town who has pineapple
                    weed, therefore he must have witnessed
                    the murder or know who did - let's go
                    kill him."
          
          Finally, Saul understands.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Mother of fuck!
          
          He SPRINGS to his feet and BOLTS for the door.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Let's go!
          
          Dale grabs Saul and stops him.
          
                                 DALE
                    Wait!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck
                    out of here!
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need,
                    like your weed and money and stuff.                   
          
          Saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack.
          They run for the door.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Are you sure you're not forgetting
                    anything?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yes! Come on!
          
          
          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Saul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press
          the button, terrified for their lives.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck! I forgot something!
          
          Saul runs back to his apartment, leaving Dale alone and
          frightened. Saul BURSTS back out of his apartment holding
          his cell.
          
                                                                    27
          
          
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Dude, I was so scared going back, I
                    thought there was gonna be guys there,
                    and then you'd be gone, and there was
                    this music in my head-
          
                                 DALE
                    We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.
          
          They scramble towards the distant stairwell. Almost at
          the door, they hear the DING of the elevator arriving.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Go back! Go back!
          
          They DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm
          between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses
          the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the
          verge of hyperventilating.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, man. We gotta try to relax.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Why?!?
          
                                 DALE
                    We don't want to draw attention.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (freaking out)
                    Whose attention!?! You think they could
                    be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be
                    cool.
          
           DING  The elevator SUDDENLY STOPS on the second floor.
          
                 DALE (CONT'D)                     SAUL
          Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!!
          
          The doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What the fuck was that?
          
                                 DALE
                    That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!
          
          The elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open, they
          step out, bumping into two rough looking guys.                  
          
                                                                   28
          
          
          
                                  DALE (CONT'D)
                    Oh. Pardon.
          
          Dale and Saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the
          elevator.
          
          
          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The rough looking guys, BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON, kick in        
          Saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. Matheson       
          spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray.
          
                                  MATHESON                               
                    Look.
          
          Budlofsky whips out his cell and hits speed dial.              
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                               
                    Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I              
                    think he knew we were coming.                        
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                   
          
          Dale peels out of his spot and down the road.
          
                                 DALE
                    Okay, what do you know about Ted?
          
                                 SAUL
                    What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's
                    tracking us with space satellites right
                    now! He's got grey hair, that's all I
                    knew.
          
          Saul checks behind them.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Let's go to your place.
          
                                 DALE
                    No way! What if they did see my license
                    plate!?!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a
                    motel, or a Holiday Inn.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, how much money do we have?
          
                                                                   29
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    All I've got is the seventy-five you gave
                    me.
          
                                   DALE
                    That's it!?!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Well, how much money do you have?
          
          While Dale gets out his wallet, Saul opens Dale's change
          tray. It's full of roaches.
          
                                 DALE
                    Uh...nine bucks.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Well, shut up then! I've got more than
                    you!
          
                                 DALE
                    Fine. Forget the hotel.
          
          A tense beat.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I wish we could just go nowhere.
          
                                 DALE
                    Okay...where's nowhere?
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
          
          The car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit
          woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over.
          
                                 DALE
                    So what do we know? Nothing. We may or
                    may not be followed because we don't even            
                    know if he found the roach or not. And,
                    we could just be completely crazy. But,
                    the question is this: even if he found
                    the roach, how could he know where you
                    were?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (thrilled)
                    He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's
                    impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on
                    the bottom of the car or some shit, but I            
                    mean-
          
                                                                  30
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    No, what I mean is, if Ted found the
                    roach and identified the weed, how could
                    he connect it to you?
          
                                 SAUL
                    There's no way. He could only find out
                    from Red.
          
                                 DALE
                    Who is this Red guy?                                
          
                                 SAUL
                    Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted
                    and guys like me. And we're mad fucking
                    tight. One time he convinced some girl he
                    knew to give me a hand-job within, like,
                    five minutes of me meeting her.
          
                                 DALE
                    But let's say someone calls asking who he
                    sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say
                    you, because...why wouldn't he?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have
                    called me if that happened. A hand-job,
                    Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand              
                    job by now!                                         
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug                 
                    dealer.                                             
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you            
                    don't trust me then?                                
          
          Saul stares at Dale, who doesn't know how to respond.         
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him.            
          
                                 SAUL

          Pleased, Saul pats Dale on the back.                          
          
                                 DALE
                    You're right. You are. I'm just being               
                    paranoid. Sorry, dude.

          Saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We
          hear someone pick up.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)

                                 SAUL
                    Yo, Red. You okay man?
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe.
          
          Red sounds nervous.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the
                    house. But Red, I gotta get straight to
                    brass tacs, I need a favor.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Sure man, anything. I'm Red.
          
                                 SAUL
                    You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know
                    how you gave me some of that pineapple
                    express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave
                    it to me.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Sure man, no problem. Red swears it,
                    hombre.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So, can I come on over now?
          
          Dale waves his hands in front of Saul's face.
          
                                 DALE
                           (louldy whispering)
                    No! We should do it tomorrow!
          
                                  SAUL
                           (covering phone, talks to
                            Dale)
                    I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's
                    just go and get this shit over with.
          
                                 DALE
                    Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared
                    shitless. I want to think things through
                    before I do anything. Let's go in the
                    morning. Please.
          
                                                                    32
          
          
          
          Saul looks around the dark forest.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in
                       the day.
          
          Dale nods.

                       -I can hear him talking to someone, so-
                       Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the
                       morning?
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah, right after I see my grandma.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow!
                       Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is
                       that the one on Granville and 41st.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be
                       chillin' by noon.
          
          Saul gives Dale the thumbs up.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       Well, cool brother. Noon it is.
          
                                    SAUL
                       We should definitely hit up the casino
                       again sometime.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       For sure. We should definitely hit up the
                       casino.
          
          Saul hangs up the cell.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone
                       cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the

                    Why isn't he coming now? What did you
                    say?
          
                                 RED
                           (incredibly afraid)
                    I didn't say shit, man! There was another
                    guy there and he said tomorrow!

                    Why did he mention the casino? The Asians
                    run the casinos. Is Saul Asian?
          
                                    RED
                    No, man!

          EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS                                        
          
                                 SAUL
                    I always liked smoking weed in the                    
                    forest.                                               
          
          Saul lights a joint and starts smoking. He passes it to         
          Dale. Dale puffs. They look around at their expansive,          
          dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with       
          paranoia. Saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky       
          as Dale takes out his cell phone.                               
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some
                    bull shit.
          
          As Dale dials, Saul, paranoid from the pot, looks at his
          cell phone. He takes another hit, and then looks up to
          the sky again. He looks back at Dale's phone. Dale starts
          to walk off.
          
                                                                    34
          
          
          
                                   SAUL
                    Dale...wait!
          
          Saul snubs out the joint and runs over to Dale.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know
                    how this shit works, but...can cops...
                    you said they might be cops...could they
                    triangulate our phones or trace `em or
                    some shit like that? I don't know. I feel
                    like I've seen that.
          
          Dale stares at Saul, then flips open his phone -  beep 
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace
                    them when we're not even on them!
          
          Dale takes a hit as he looks up to the sky. Just then, a
          loud rumbling noise is heard.
          
                                 DALE
                    What the fuck is that?!
          
          The rumbling gets louder.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Are we on fucking "Lost"?! What the hell
                    is that?!
          
                                   SAUL
                    It's them!!!
          
          The noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys
          dive behind a tree stump. A moment later, a JUMBO JET
          buzzes overhead, heading towards the nearby airport. Dale
          and Saul pop up.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Holy fuck. That was close.
          
                                 DALE
                           (clutching cell phone)
                    You know what? You're right. We should
                    just get rid of them. We should just
                    smash `em.
          
          Dale looks at his phone, which is a new, expensive Razor.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I
                    can just take the batteries out?
          
                                                                    35
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    No! Smash it!
          
          Dale sighs, then SMASHES his phone on a rock. Saul looks
          at Dale, then HURLS his phone into the woods as hard as
          he can, sending it SAILING into the FOREST.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Shit!
          
                                 DALE
                    What the fuck was that?!
          
          Dale tosses the joint aside.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that
                    tree!
          
                                 DALE
                    What tree?
          
                                 SAUL
                    That one.
          
          Saul points out a group of trees about 30 feet away.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free
                    with the plan. It must've smashed when it
                    landed.
          
                                 DALE
                    Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why
                    couldn't you have just smashed it on a
                    rock like a normal person?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I was trying to smash it! How often does
                    a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck.
          
                                 DALE
                    Did you at least see where it landed?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could
                    call it!
          
                                 DALE
                    With what? I just smashed my phone!
          
          They look into the scary dark depths of the woods. Both
          of them are clearly terrified.
          
                                                                 36
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Man, it's not like they got McGuyver
                    workin' on the case. I bet they can't
                    even triangulate it.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, then you shouldn't have said
                    anything, cause now you've convinced me
                    that they can!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid
                    thing and get back to doing what we were
                    doin'.
          
          Horrified, they cautiously inch into the forest.
          
                                 DALE
                    Do you see it?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, this is the scariest place I've
                    ever been in my life.
          
          They nervously walk on.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    You ever see that movie where all the
                    people are in the woods and they slowly
                    get killed?

                    The "Blair Witch Project."

                    No...Shit. That one's way scarier than
                    the one I was thinking of. Mine had
                    Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm
                    thinking of the fucking Blair Witch.
          
          They inch forward, nervous.

                    What is-
          
                                 DALE
                           (whispering)
                    Sshh! Can you hear that?
          
                                  SAUL
                            (whispering)
                    What?
          
                                 DALE
                           (whispering)
                    Just listen.
          
          Saul listens.
          
                                  SAUL
                           (whispering)
                    I literally hear nothing.
                           (gasp)
                    Wait...
          
          SUDDENLY, Saul SPRINTS off into the darkness!
          
                                    DALE
                    SAUL!!!
          
          Dale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees.
          
                                 SAUL(O.S.)
                           (screaming in pain)
                    ARGHHH!!!
          
          Dale hears a loud THUD.
          
          Scared for his life, he SPRINTS in the opposite
          direction! He weaves in between the trees, avoids some
          rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then
          SLAMS half his body against a tree and FALLS HARD.
          
          ANGLE ON: SAUL
          
          Saul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around
          the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something
          and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS
          into the ground.
          
                                                                    38
          
          
          
          ANGLE ON: DALE
          
          Dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe
          the dirt off his suit.
          
                                 DALE
                    Shit.
          
          Saul hears Dale and whips around, breaking a twig -
           CRACK 
          
          Dale looks towards the noise, then SPRINTS off.
          
          Saul hears someone and BOLTS in the opposite direction.
          
          Like chickens with their heads cut off, they both
          scramble through the woods trying to evade their
          imaginary enemies.
          
          Dale spots his car! He jumps in and SLAMS the door shut.
          He's about to turn the ignition, but stops. Panting and
          wheezing, he sinks into his seat.
          
          BAM! Something slams into the car.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
          
          Dale sees Saul BANGING against the passenger side door.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (muffled through the window)
                    Let me in! Let me in!
          
          Dale unlocks the car and Saul JUMPS in.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Let's go! Go!
          
                                 DALE
                    Is there anyone even out there?!?
          
                                 SAUL

                                 DALE

                    you run like that?!?
          
                                 SAUL

                    No! We're not going anywhere!

                    But there could be something out there!               
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    There's nothing out there, that's why                 
                    we're here. God, man, you scared the                  
                    fucking shit out of me.

                    Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm             
                    staying in the car.                                   
          
          A moment of silence. They both look around. There is
          clearly nothing out there. Dale turns on the car. Talk
          radio comes on.

          Dale and Saul start rolling separate joints.                    
          
                                                                   40
          
          
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - THE NEXT DAY
          
          Dale slowly wakes up. He stretches, and then shakes Saul.
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
          
          Saul opens his eyes and realizes where he is.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck me.
          
                                 DALE
                    What's the time?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (groggy)
                    It's too early.
          
          Saul brings his wrist up close to his eyes.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It's...
          
          Saul stares at his watch, confused.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    This can't be right.
          
                                 DALE
                    What does it say?
          
                                 SAUL
                    It says, uh...
          
          Saul looks outside towards the sun.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It couldn't be three in the morning,
                    could it?
          
                                 DALE
                    It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to

                            (angry)
                    How?
          
          Dale digs in his pockets for the keys.
          
                                 SAUL
                    We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number
                    was in my phone!
          
          Dale notices the keys are in the ignition.
          
                                 DALE
                    You remember where he lives, right?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yes, I remember. What the hell is that
                    supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm
                    forgetful? That's right, I know the word
                    insinuating.
          
                                 DALE
                    Let's just get out of here.
          
          He turns the keys. NOTHING. He tries again. NOTHING.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck? Come on.
          
          He tries twice more, but nothing happens.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                           (pissed off)
                    I think the battery's dead.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Are you fucking serious?
          
          He tries again.
          
                                  DALE
                    It's dead.
          
                                  SAUL
                    It's dead?

          Dale shoots Saul an angry look.                               
          
                                  SAUL (CONT'D)                         
                     What the fuck happened? How did this
                     happen?
          
                                  DALE
                     How? We fell asleep!

          Frustrated, Dale tries to gather his thoughts.
          
                                  DALE
                     We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll          
                     walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.
          
                                 SAUL
                     For real?
          
          Dale opens his door and hops out.
          
                                  DALE
                     Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but               
                     we'll get there. Then we can fix this
                     insane situation.
          
          MONTAGE:                                                      
          
          - Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road,     
          each smoking their own joint.                                 
          
          - Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf.
          Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then
          blows weed smoke onto it.
          
                                  DALE (CONT'D)                         
                     Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave           
                     that thing alone.                                  
          
          - They emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride.
          
          - Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his         
          zipper.
          
                                  SAUL
                     It's like, my thumb is my cock!
          
          Dale doesn't laugh.                                           
          
                                                                    43
          
          
          
          - Bored and tired, they wait.   Saul lights a joint. Dale       
          notices. Saul shifts his body   away from Dale. Just then,      
          an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. Saul snubs out the
          freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket.
          
          
          EXT. RED'S HOUSE - LATER                                        
          
          Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (to the driver)
                    Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.
          
          Saul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's           
          house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of         
          town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul           
          knocks.
          
                                 DALE
                    So, what's this guy like?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know. He's short...and stout. So
                    he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, do you think he'll be there?
          
                                  SAUL
                    I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight
                    hours late.
                           (beat)                                         
                    That's actually pretty late.                          
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                           (through door)
                    Who is it?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Red! It's Saul. Open up.
          
          Red opens the door. He has a SPLIT LIP and has clearly
          been CRYING. He tries to act normal. Dale immediately
          suspects something is up.
          
                                 RED
                           (sniffling)
                    Who's this guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    Dale. Nice to meet you.
          
                                                                    44
          
          
          
          Red ushers them in and shuts the door.
          
                                   RED
                    Dale who?
          
                                   DALE
                    I think it's    better if you don't know my           
                    last-                                                 
          
                                 SAUL
                           (oblivious)
                    Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.                
          
          Red notices their dirty clothes.
          
                                 RED
                           (to Saul)
                    What happened to your clothes? Where'd
                    you call me from, man?
          
          Dale notices Red quivering as he lights a cigarette and
          becomes increasingly suspicious.
          
                                 SAUL
                    We were in the forest laying low.
                    Thinking.
          
                                 DALE
                    Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?
          
          Saul finally notices Red's dishevelled appearance.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?
          
                                 RED
                    What? Oh, I uh...
                           (feeling his split lip)
                    ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one
                    before. I started crying.
          
                                 SAUL
                    A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
          
                                 RED
                    ...uh, yeah, man.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how
                    many joints we've shared? I told you,
                    man. This is from that time you ate the               
                    lollypop straight from the strippers sna-
          
                                                         45
          
          
          
                       DALE
          Saul. Ask him.
          
                       SAUL
                     (to Dale)
          Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill
          out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask-
          
                       RED
          Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all
          about? That's what I want to know.
          
                       SAUL
          Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for
          protest lawyers, and-                                
          
                       DALE
          Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well,
          Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't
          think we should tell you any more than
          you need to know.
          
                       RED
          Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I
          deserve to know.
          
                       SAUL
          Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his
          house.
          
                       DALE
          Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you
          into the shit we're in. It's just
          trouble.
          
                       SAUL
          Don't be weird about this. If he wants
          trouble, it's his right to have it.
          
                       RED
          Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.
          
                       DALE
          That's why we only need to clarify one
          thing - nobody's called about Saul or the
          pineapple express or anything like that?
          
                       RED
          No one. Nada.
          
                                                                   46
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine.
                    We had a crazy night in the woods, which             
                    I assume we can both put behind us like              
                    grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant            
                    bong to get super-duper high.                        
          
          Dale doesn't seem convinced. Saul picks up Red's huge          
          bong and starts to pack a bit of Red's weed into it.           
          
                                 RED                                     
                    Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at
                    home. I'm just going to use the ol'
                    telephone-o.                                         
          
          Saul sits down and picks up a lighter as Red walks             
          towards the phone. Dale watches Red, suspicious of his         
          odd behavior. Red begins to dial...
          
          SMACK! Dale knocks the phone out of Red's hand.
          
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!
          
          Saul jumps up. Dale SNATCHES the phone and backs up.
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
          
                                  SAUL
                    Dale!   What the fuck are you doing?
          
                                 DALE
                           (to Saul)
                    We can't let him call anyone! He's acting
                    weird!
          
                                 RED
                    Fuck you man - this is my house!                     
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and
                    paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!
                           (to Red)                                      
                    I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought             
                    this guy over here, he's a total lunatic.            
          
          Without warning, Red grabs a LARGE ASHTRAY filled with
          cigarette butts and WHIPS it at Dale. BAM! It smashes him
          in the head!!!
          
                                                                    47
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                           (in pain)
                    AAAHHH!
          
          Ash EXPLODES everywhere as Dale drops the phone and
          clutches his head.
          
                                   SAUL
                    Holy cock!
          
          Red approaches the cowering Dale. Saul intercedes.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Dude! He's sorry! Wait!
          
          Red PUNCHES Saul in the face! Saul SCREAMS and drops to
          the ground.
          
                                   SAUL (CONT'D)
                    WHY!?!?!
          
          Dale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom,
          slamming the door behind him.
          
          
          INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Disoriented, Dale scans the small bathroom. Saul and Red
          can be heard fighting outside.
          
                                 SAUL (O.S.)
                    Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is                 
                    wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked              
                    off that shit again!?! Ow!                            
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please                  
                    don't fight!                                          
          
          A loud CRASH is heard from the other room.
          
                                   SAUL                                   
                    AAAHHHHHH!!!                                          
          
          Dale throws the phone in the toilet bowl and smacks down
          the seat. He runs back to help Saul.
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Red is BEATING the shit out of Saul.
          
                                                                    48
          
          
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    Why, man!?! Why!                                      
          
                                   RED                                    
                    I'M SORRY!!!                                          
          
          Saul manages to stand up when Red boots him in the BALLS!
          He SHRIEKS and stumbles backwards. Dale dashes into the
          room and LEAPS onto Red's back. Red wobbles forward, then       
          starts RUNNING BACKWARDS. He trips on his coffee table
          and CRASHES Dale through it, landing on top of him. Red         
          gets up, sprints into the bathroom and locks the door.
          With great effort, Dale and Saul manage to get up.
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    He's going for the phone! Bathroom!                   
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Frantically searching for the phone, Red flips the toilet
          seat up and grabs it. He begins to dial as Dale and Saul
          sprint down the hall.
          
          Just as Red is about to finish dialing, Dale and Saul
          CRASH into the bathroom door! They knock it completely
          off it's hinges, SLAMMING it directly into Red! The phone
          flies into the bathtub.
          
                                 DALE
                           (pointing at the phone)
                    SAUL!!! Phone!!!
          
          Saul jumps into the bathtub and begins STOMPING the
          phone. Dale continuously SLAMS his body against the door
          in an attempt to keep Red pinned down.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is
                    going on!?!
          
                                 RED
                    I don't know!!! They're going to kill
                    me!!!
          
                                 SAUL
                    You didn't stub your toe, did you?
          
          Red stops struggling and tries to catch his breath. Dale
          kneels on top of the door, keeping him pinned.
          
                                   DALE
                    Now tell us-
          
                                                                   49
          
          
          
                                 RED
                    They're gonna come back and kill me!!!
          
          In an impressive show of strength, Red shoves the door
          off him, knocking Dale aside. He runs.
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul chases Red and TACKLES him into a wall. Dale follows
          seconds later, and notices Red's LARGE GLASS BONG. He
          looks back to see Saul getting pummelled.
          
                                  SAUL                                   
                    DALE! HELP!                                          
          
          Dale grabs the bong and swings around - CRASH!!! It
          shatters on the back of Red's head.
          
          Red falls to the ground moaning, blood dripping from his
          head. Dale and Saul stand over him, out of breath,
          bruised and battered.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                           
                    Red, you motherfucker.
          
          Dale, lost in thought, starts to seriously freak out.
          
                                 DALE
                    It's happening! It's actually happening!
                    He knows my name! Red knows my name!
          
                                 SAUL
                    We should beat it out of his sellout
                    brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck
                    the Casino! Go alone!
          
                                 DALE
                    This is fucked, what do we do now, he
                    knows my name!?!
          
                                 SAUL
                    He knows my name too!
          
                                 DALE
                    Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!
          
                                 SAUL
                    We're not gonna have to kill him, are we?
                    I don't think I could do that.
          
          Dale stares at the almost motionless Red.
          
                                                                  50
          
          
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Maybe we could talk him into killing
                    himself, or, like, make him promise not
                    to tell.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, we have to find out what he knows.
          
                                 RED
                           (in great pain)
                    I don't know anything...you broke my
                    bong...
          
          Dale, trying to act tough, grabs Red by the collar.
          
                                 DALE
                    Tell us everything. Now!
          
          Red looks to Saul for sympathy.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Don't look at me, you sellout bastard.
                    Now start talking!
          
                                 RED
                    I can't...I don't know anything.
          
          Dale pulls Saul aside.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What do we do? He's not gonna talk.
          
                                 DALE
                    I think we beat it out of him.
          
                                   SAUL
                    For real?
          
                                 DALE
                    Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't
                    tell us everything, we're going to beat
                    you up.
          
                                 RED
                    Don't beat me up! Saul, dude, I'm Red!
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    You were Red. Now you're no one to me.              
          
                                 DALE
                    You've got five seconds, okay? Ready?
                    Five, four-
          
                                                                 51
          
          
          
          Dale raises his fist.
          
                                 RED
                    Please don't.
          
                                 DALE
                    Three, two...one!
          
          Red cringes as Dale softly "punches" his gut. It doesn't
          hurt him.
          
                                 RED
                    That didn't hurt.
          
                                 SAUL
                    You didn't even hurt him! Hit him hard,
                    man. Like, fucking hit him!
          
          Dale takes a deep breathe and raises his fist.
          
                                 RED
                    Wait! I...I...                                     
          
          Dale grabs a potted plant.                                   
          
                                  RED (CONT'D)                         
                    No!                                                
          
          Dale swings the plant back to strike Red. The pot flies      
          off the plant and Dale smashes the dirt covered roots of     
          the plant against Red's face.                                
          
                                 RED (CONT'D)                          
                    Ow! Fuck, man! Stop it.

                    Who were they?
          
          Dale raises his fist.
          
                                 RED
                    They work for Ted. Budlofsky and                   
                    Matheson. Fuckin' crazy weird guys. They           
                    were here all day, but you guys didn't
                    show. They said they'd kill me if I
                    didn't bring you to them, they said I'd-
          
                                                                   52

                    How many cops does he have in his...uh,
                    payroll, or whatever?
          
                                 RED
                    I know there's this lady cop. He could
                    have more, I don't know. He's got pretty
                    crazy connections. He's also got a cool-             
                    ass hideout. It's crazy man.                         
          
          Dale and Saul exchange very worried looks.
          
                                  RED (CONT'D)
                    Listen, I-
          
          Dale swings the PLANT upwards, prepared to strike Red          
          again.

                                 DALE
                    Asians? Which Asians? Indians are
                    technically Asian.
          
                                 RED

                    calls them the Asians.
          
          Dale and Saul exchange an even more worried look.
          
                                  SAUL
                    What else?

                                 DALE
                    Alright. We should...tie him up and...and
                    get the fuck out of here.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I made a gravity bong here once. I know
                    where his duct tape is.
          
          Saul runs off. Dale puts on Saul's backpack and looks at
          the battered Red moaning on the floor.
          
                                                                    53

                    up.
          
          Dale pulls Red's hands behind his back. Saul is picking
          at the tape.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    I can't find the edge.

          Saul rips open the DUCT TAPE. He quickly BINDS Red's            
          hands and feet. SUDDENLY, there's a KNOCK at the door.          
          They stop, silent. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. Red starts              
          thrashing and trying to scream.

          Ted walks into the kitchen where CAROL BRAZIER (female

                    If the Asians have the balls to send an
                    assassin right into my home, we can't be
                    too cautious. The boys say Denton and
                    Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their
                    assassin failed, they hired this outside              
                    guy Denton to finish the job.                         
                           (pondering)
                    Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned
                    "going to the casino."
          
                                 CAROL                                    
                    "Going to the casino"? I don't like that.

                                 ANSWERING MACHINE

                    " cough  It's Dale. I'm probably at work,            
                    maybe we'll talk later.  BEEP "                      
          
          Matheson walks to the fridge and yanks off a NOTE.             
          
                                 MATHESON

          Budlofsky looks at the note:

          Dale and Saul get out of the cab in a pleasant                  
          neighborhood. Saul begrudgingly pays the driver. They           
          walk towards Angie's house.                                     
          
                                 DALE
                    Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a
                    minute.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I
                    want to go with you!
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally              
                    be five minutes. Please.                              
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fine. But hurry.                                      
          
          Dale runs up to the front door and frantically knocks.          
          Angie answers the door.

          Dale dashes in.                                                 
          
                                 DALE

          Angie opens the door with a smile, the phone in hand. Her
          attention is towards the phone conversation she is
          having. Dale enters her apartment.
          
          
          INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                             
          
                                 ANGIE                                    
                    It's Dale! You came.                                  
          
          Dale freezes in horror: ANGIE'S PARENTS (SHANNON and            
          ROBERT) are pleasantly eating at the dining room table.         
          
                                 SHANNON                                  
                    Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and              
                    have some couscous. Can I get you a                   
                    drink?                                                
          
          Robert sees that Dale is DIRTY, DISHEVELLED, BRUISED and        
          BATTERED.

                                  ANGIE                                 
                    Dale?   What happened to you?                       
          
          Robert and Shannon exchange worried looks.

                    Nothing, I was in the woods and...                  
                           (turns to Angie's parents)                   
                    ...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to                  
                    finally meet you both...I apologize for

                    Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both           
                    of you.                                             
          
          Dale walks to Robert and extends his DIRTY, BLOODY HAND.      
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)

          Robert smugly declines Dale's hand shake.

                    I've been thrust into a kind of,                    
                    ah...situation. So, uh, if we could all             
                    just start to evacuate...                           
          
          Dale starts gathering all their jackets and shoes.            
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)                          
                    ...that'd be really, really good right

                    to get the "F" out of here!                           
          
          The Anderson's stare at him dumbfounded. Robert gets up         
          and stands tall.

                    Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal             
                    - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I              
                    was working...this morning. The cop shot              
                    the guy then saw my car drive off, and I              
                    think they might have seen my license                 
                    plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the              
                    woods, so...                                          
          
          They stare at Dale as though he were crazy.

          Saul sees a car nearing. He sees Budlofsky and Matheson

                    Why?
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, it's complicated. See,

                    we just have to get out of here.

          Robert runs up the stairs to his bedroom.                      
          
          Suddenly, Saul bursts through the front door in a              
          panicked frenzy.                                               
          
                                 SAUL
                           (completely out of breath)
                    You... huff ...Angie? Dale! It's                     
                    happening!

                    EEEHHHH!!!
          
          Angie grabs a fork off the table and stabs it into Saul's      
          shoulder.

                                 ANGIE
                           (freaking out)
                    Dale, it's one of the drug dealers!!!
          
                                 SAUL
                    No! I'm Dale's dealer, I'm S-

                    Angie! Stop! It's Saul!                            
          
                                 SHANNON                               
                    What did you do, Angie?!                           
          
          Saul yanks the fork out and tosses it on the ground.         
          
                                 SAUL

                    Saul? Dale, who is-

          Then - Robert appears at the top of the stairs with his      
          gun. He sees Saul bleeding and SCREAMS. BLAM! He fires at    
          Saul!

          Budlofsky and Matheson are walking towards the front door    
          when they hear the gunshot and dive behind some bushes.      
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY

                    What the fuck is going on?

          Everyone is in shock. Saul frantically pats himself down     
          to see if he got hit.

          Dale looks at the pandemonium as everyone tries to be         
          heard.

          Budlofsky and Matheson are now at the front door. They've     
          each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in.           
          Budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge.

          Budlofsky puts in the last few bullets.

          BAM! They kick open the doors and run into her house. No        
          one is there. Budlofsky cautiously walks over to the            
          table and touches the food. It's still warm. Matheson           
          bends down and picks up a bloody fork.

          Dale, Angie, her parents, and Saul burst into the garage.       
          Robert is fumbling with the keys. He manages to open the        
          car. Saul pulls up his shirt to look at the stab wound.

          Ted and Carol are in mid-discussion, and rather
          distraught at that. Behind them two henchmen take the
          dead Asian man's body out the back door.

                    A bloody fork. In his girlfriends house.            
                    And the blood was fresh.
          
                                 CAROL
                    Maybe he killed her, to protect himself.

                    Or maybe it's the Asians fucking with us.

                    in the woods to distract us. Took us an             
                    hour to find it. And we found Denton's              
                    car, which was filled with all these

          INT. CHEUNG'S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cheung, the leader of the Asians, has a lavish mansion
          which is covered in ornate decorations and expensive
          merchandise. It is immaculately clean and organized.
          Several armed men with earpieces stand in strategic
          locations throughout the house. Cheung is reading a
          Korean book alone in his study. The phone rings and he
          picks it up.
          
                                   CHEUNG

                    Cheung. It's Ted.
          
          Cheung sits up, shocked to have his opponent calling him.
          He snaps his fingers and two guards run in. He covers the
          phone.

                    Ted. This is surprising. What would you
                    like?
          
                                 TED
                    Cheung, I want you to call off your man
                    Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout,
                    assassin, and frankly I don't care. I
                    just want him gone. I want him dead. If
                    you do this, I'll consider it a peace
                    offering, otherwise, you're asking for
                    war. And just in case you forgot, I'm
                    number one, and there's a reason for
                    that. You've got 24 hours to reply.
          
          We stay on Cheung. He hails another guard.
          
                                                                   68

                    failed to kill him, but it did rattle his            
                    confidence. It's earlier than planned,               
                    but we should strike now, while he is                
                    confused. Let it be known-

          Dale and Saul are sitting in the branches of a tree. Fast      
          food wrappers lie scattered. Saul is rolling a joint.

                    Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
          
          Saul passes it to Dale, who lights it. Dale takes another
          puff and starts to seriously relax. A smile creeps across
          his face as he passes the joint to Saul.

                    always, like, "you don't like me, you
                    like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" You
                    know? And just so you know, I totally              
                    could have lit that cross-joint on my
                    own. I'd just have to use candles, but,
                    like, I've never smoked one of those with

          stretches; for a few moments, looking completely relaxed,
          but then-
          
          A COP CAR screeches to a halt right in front of Dale! A
          female POLICE LIAISON OFFICER (who is not Carol) gets out
          of the car. Dale freezes in horror.

          places her hand on a can of pepper spray.

                    they got it back here. Put your hands up.
          
          She cuffs Dale's hands behind him!
          
                                 DALE
                    Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I
                    have is this little joint.
          
          
          Police Liaison takes the large joint out of Dale's hand.
          
                                                                    75
          
          
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    You call this little?
          
          She throws it on the ground and smears it around with her
          foot.
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't even have any money! How did I
                    sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I
                    was just smoking it. I swear. Please.
          
          She pats him down, finding only his wallet. The Police
          Liaison sees he only has nine dollars. She pulls out his
          DRIVER'S LICENSE.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    It's possible you're telling the truth.
                    I'm going to run a check and if it turns
                    out you don't have any priors and all
                    you've got is this small amount of
                    marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine.
                    Take a seat.
          
          She walks towards her car as Dale sits on the ground.
          
          ANGLE ON: Saul
          
          Saul merrily turns into the alley holding TWO RED
          SLURPEES, when he jumps back in terror! He sees the cop         
          car up the alley. He ducks back behind the corner.
          
                                 SAUL
                    They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh
                    fuck...
          
          ANGLE ON: Dale and the Police Liaison
          
          She looks at her car computer. The screen reads:
          
          DALE DENTON: OUTSTANDING WARRANT - DOUBLE HIT AND RUN.
          
          She looks back at Dale and types into her computer.
          
          
          INT. CAROL'S COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          We see Carol (who is in fact Ted's evil accomplice)
          speeding down the road. Her police computer beeps. She
          looks at the screen.
          
                                 CAROL
                           (smiling)
                    Denton.
          
                                                                    76
          
          
          
          
          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
          
          The Police Liaison stuffs Dale in the back of her squad
          car.
          
                                 DALE
                    What is this for? What did that thing
                    tell you? What did I do?
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double,
                    actually. You hit two parked cars two
                    nights ago.
          
          A look of crippling horror comes across Dale's face as
          she throws him in the back seat and slams his door shut.
          
          ANGLE ON: Saul
          
          He peaks down the alley and sees Dale in the back of the
          car and the FEMALE Police Liaison getting in the front.
          
                                 SAUL
                    The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
          
          The car slowly makes a three point turn.
          
          
          INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
                                 DALE
                    You don't understand! You have to let me
                    go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please!
          
          The Police Liaison ignores Dale.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    This...this lady cop, and these guys                  
                    Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for

                           (suddenly interested)
                    Ted Jones?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know
                    what I'm talking about. He lives near
                    Evergreen Heights. He-
          
                                                                    77
          
          
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and
                    a police office shoot someone?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. An Asian someone.
          
          The Police Liaison ponders as she finishes her three
          point turn and drives toward the exit of the alley.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you
                    down to the station.
          
                                 DALE
                           (ecstatic)
                    Yes ma'am.
          
          
          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car. He looks
          at the two red slurpees and thinks, then suddenly jumps
          out and THROWS himself onto the hood of the cop car!
          
          The Police Liaison and Dale see a body SLAM against the
          car and RED LIQUID SPLATTER everywhere, covering the
          windshield. They SCREAM.
          
          WHAM! In the impact, we clearly see Saul's BALLS getting
          ROCKED on the car! The Police Liaison slams on the
          brakes, causing Dale to SMASH into the metal cage.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
          
          She puts the car in park. As the Police Liaison gets out
          of her car, Saul can be seen crawling around the back of
          the vehicle, clutching his testicles. The frightened
          Police Liaison looks at the windshield.
          
          She notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and
          quickly turns around. She sees Saul jumping into the
          drivers seat.
          
          Saul sees a SHOTGUN beside the passenger seat. The Police
          Liaison reaches for her GUN!
          
                                 DALE
                    NO! What are you doing!?!
          
                                                                    78
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and
                    Cash!
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Freeze mister! Don't even...
          
          Saul slams the car into reverse! He speeds backwards up
          the alley as the Police Liaison runs after them - GUN
          DRAWN!
          
                                 DALE
                    No! She was going to help us!
          
                                 SAUL
                           (in pain)
                    Oh...my balls...I seriously think I
                    popped one...
          
          Suddenly, Carol (the cop from Ted's house) whips her COP
          CAR into the alley! WHAM!!! It smashes into the rear of
          their car! Dale turns around and establishes eye contact
          with the stunned Carol.
          
                                 DALE
                           (horrified)
                    IT'S HER! The lady cop!
          
          Saul slams down the gas! Through the slurpee covered
          window Saul sees the Police Liaison rushing towards them.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (motion at the Police
                            Liaison)
                    Then who's that?
          
          The Police Liaison raises her gun.
          
                 SAUL (CONT'D)                      DALE
          NOOOO!!!                      AAAAH!!!
          
          BLAM! She fires and the bullet punches through the              
          windshield! The Police Liaison dives to the side as they        
          zoom past her! They burst out of the alley. A moment
          later, Carol follows, in hot pursuit.
          
          
          I/E. DALE AN SAUL'S STOLEN COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The car weaves through traffic.
          
                                 SAUL
                    The slurpee! I can't see!
          
                                                                    79
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    Turn on the wipers!
          
          Saul mindlessly starts grasping at switches in the car.
          He finally turns on the wipers, which wipe away the
          slurpee and reveal that the window is so badly cracked he
          still can't see through it. Carol's car emerges right           
          behind them.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, I seriously can't see!
          
                                 DALE
                    Kick out the window! Isn't that what they
                    do?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know. Okay.
          
          Saul, with great effort, keeps one foot on the pedals
          and, with all his might, kicks his other leg through the
          front window. His leg PUNCHES straight through the glass,
          but he can't pull it back in!
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Oh fuck! Shit!
          
                                 DALE
                    Get it out of there!
          
          Suddenly, their car gets jerked to the side.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Ah! Ah! My leg!
          
          Carol is ramming them from behind.
          
                                 DALE
                           (hysterical)
                    She's following us! She's gaining on us!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Her car's better!
          
          Saul yanks at his leg and manages to wriggle it out of
          the hole. He begins to accelerate and realizes he can see
          where he's going through the hole.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole!
          
          Saul bumps over the curb and cuts through a LARGE PARK.
          Carol is right behind them.
          
                                                                    80
          
          
          
                                  DALE
                     Do something!
          
          Saul thinks hard, then buckles his seat belt.
          
                                  SAUL
                     Hold on. I've got an idea.
          
          Dale does what little he can to brace himself. Saul SLAMS
          on the breaks. Carol sees Saul screeching to a halt and         
          slams on her breaks. She grunts and whips out her GUN.          
          Both cars come to a full stop beside one another.               
          
          She opens fire - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! - Bullets
          rip through the stolen cruiser. Shattered glass flies
          everywhere. Dale and Saul desperately duck for cover.
          
          Saul hits the gas and the bullet riddled car takes off.
          Carol follows.
          
                                  DALE
                     WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
          
          Saul pops back up and begins steering again.
          
                                  SAUL
                     Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd
                     keep going.
          
          The car bumps back on to a main road. Carol follows,
          sirens blaring.
          
                                  DALE
                     Turn on the sirens!
          
          Saul's hand flails around, grasping everything. He feels
          the SHOTGUN and accidentally pulls the trigger-
          
          BOOM! The blast blows through the roof of the car and
          hits an overhead TRAFFIC LIGHT - shredding it to pieces!
          
                      SAUL                          DALE
          JESUS!!!                         SHIT!
          
          Carol flies into the intersection on a collision course
          with Saul and Dale.
          
          CRUNCH! A car smashes into the side of the Carol's
          cruiser.
          
          As Dale and Saul speed off, Carol emerges from the
          smoking wreckage, a look of hate in her eyes.

          The stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and Saul hops out.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Run!
          
          He starts running up the block at top speed.
          
          Dale, still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser, starts
          thrashing and screaming.
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
          
          Dale continues to scream as Saul obliviously bolts to the
          end of the block and just keeps going.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!
          
          Dale sits in the car, helpless. He has a look of utter
          disbelief on his face. After a moment of silence he
          starts wildly kicking the door window. He soon gives up.
          
          Just then, Dale notices Saul, over a block away, running
          back towards the stolen car. Saul soon arrives,
          completely out of breath, and opens the door.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So... huff ... huff ...fuckin'
                    sorry... huff ...forgot...
          
          Dale flops out of the car and onto the grass. Saul tries
          to help him to his feet, but Dale pulls away.
          
                                 DALE
                    Don't touch me, you asshole!
          
          Dale wiggles to his feet runs for it. Saul follows.
          
          
          INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                       
          
          Dale and Saul enter the hardware store, walking very            
          close together so that no one sees Dale is handcuffed.          
          They receive a few odd looks as they search and locate          
          what they are looking for: saws. Saul quickly finds a           
          sturdy looking hack-saw.                                        
          
                                                                    82

                    Okay, only one way to do this, hard and               
                    fast. Bend over.                                      
          
          Dale gets on his knees and bends over, pressing his face        
          up against the wall. Saul begins to manically hack away         
          at the cuffs.                                                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Ow! Ow! Hurry!                                        
          
                                  SAUL

          Suddenly, Saul sees a store clerk coming and shoves the         
          saw underneath Dale's suit jacket.                              
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Which saw do you like most?                           
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    The brown ones nice, but the metallic                 
                    ones seems more...                                    
          
          They watch the clerk walk off and immediately return to         
          sawing the handcuffs.

          Dale stretches his arms. The handcuffs are still on his         
          hands, but no longer attached.

                    Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be                  
                    right back.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Angie is watching TV alone in a hotel room. The phone
          rings and she picks it up.
          
                                 ANGIE
                    Dale?

                    I'm great. I'm fine. I miss you. So,                
                    here's the plan, babe. I'm going to leave           
                    town and contact a government official or
                    something. From somewhere safe. I know              
                    this shit is all fucked up and I just

                                 ANGIE
                    Dale. I've realized some problems and-
          
                                 DALE
                    I know there's a problem! That's the

                    dealers are trying to kill me, because of           
                    you! It's fucking over, man. Are you                
                    kidding me? For gods sake...

                    Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was              
                    thrown into this situation, I had no                
                    control, but I am dealing with it. This

                    You're immature, Dale! I'm six years                
                    younger and I'm saying this! And the fact           
                    that you think you're some kind of
                    fucking genius just makes it a hundred

          As Dale walks out of his phone booth, we see that Saul is    
          on the phone in the next booth and is also smoking from a    
          pipe.

          Saul hangs up and exits the phone booth.                     
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                         
                    Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta            
                    go see my grandma, okay? She was worried           
                    `cause I didn't show up to help with the           
                    locks. But before that I've got to smoke           
                    another bowl.                                      
          
                                 DALE
                    Are you joking? You're actually gonna
                    smoke marijuana?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Why not?                                           
          
                                 DALE
                    How can you smoke marijuana after what we
                    just went through? That clearly happened
                    because we were smoking marijuana.
          
                                 SAUL
                    No. It happened because those fucking
                    kids didn't keep that shit on the down
                    low. Which is weird, `cause they really            
                    seemed like cool kids.

                    functional when we're stoned, Saul.

                    When I saved you with those Slurpees I
                    was stoned. What do you gotta say to
                    that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the
                    creative capacity to come up with such a
                    great plan! The Beatles were high!                    
          
                                 DALE

                    protect us, and now we're wanted for all
                    sorts of crazy shit!

                    For one thing, I'm done dealing pot.
                    Mostly, because I don't know where I
                    would get it now, but still. And "b",
                    fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're
                    exactly the same, and this whole thing's
                    your fucking fault. You're the one who
                    dropped the roach!

                    It's not my fault!
          
          Dale points at Saul's bowl.

                    guy in the world. The only reason I ever              
                    bought weed from you was because you're               
                    shit is so good, not because you're cool.

                    But you said you bought when you already              
                    had a few times, just to hang out?

          Saul takes out his wad of cash and throws half of it at
          Dale.

          He throws fifty more cents at the shocked Dale.

          A sad Dale starts picking up the money.

          MUSIC UP: THE END by THE DOORS
          
          - Saul gets on a bus and sits down, sad and deject.           
          
          - Dale sits against the phone booth, crying like a baby.      
          He buries his hands in his pocket and pulls out his baggy     
          of weed. He hurls it away. He gets up to retrieve it.         
          
          - Saul is in a really shitty fast food restaurant, nearly     
          crying as he eats his burger and fries.                       
          
          - Dale stares at a joint in his hands, thinks for a           
          moment, and then, crying profusely, lights it and starts
          smoking.
          
          A solitary tear rolls down his cheek and drips directly
          onto the tip of the joint, putting it out. Dale hears the
          sizzle and looks at the joint. He continues crying. He        
          puts the joint down, beside three large roaches.              
          
          - Walking down the street, Saul sees the Point Grey           
          Retirement Home.                                              
          
          - Dale feverishly looks through the phone book. He finds      
          what he's looking for: Belogus.                               
          
          - Saul, hiding behind a bush across the street, surveys       
          the retirement home. Seeing the coast is clear, he walks
          towards the entrance. As Saul enters the building,            
          Budlofksy and Matheson pull up.                               
          
          
          INT. RETIREMENT HOME - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul casually walks into the lobby. The elderly residents
          of the retirement home are milling around the massive
          common room.
          
                                 ELDERLY WOMAN(O.S.)
                    Solly?
          
          Saul turns and sees an ELDERLY WOMAN.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Hey! Mrs. Mendelson!
          
          Saul peers over her shoulder and sees Budlofsky and           
          Matheson walk in!                                             
          
                                                                    88

                    HOLY SHIT!!!
          
          Saul runs for it, and they chase after him. He maneuvers        
          through the elderly like a pylon course, the thugs right        
          on his ass. He bursts into another room.

          He tears through the room, filled with old people eating.       
          Budlofsky and Matheson pursue him.                              
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                       
          
          As Saul runs through the hall, Budlofksy and Matheson           
          appear.                                                         
          
                                   MATHESON                               
                    Eat it!                                               
          
          Matheson whip out his gun and fires - BLAM! The bullet          
          whizzes past Saul and two elderly men, who don't even           
          flinch, and then shatters a distant window. Saul turns          
          the corner and-                                                 
          
          BAM! He slams into someone, sending the person crashing         
          to the ground.                                                  
          
                                 INJURED PERSON                           
                    OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow!                                
          
          Saul looks, terrified he's hurt an old person, but sees         
          it is a young male nurse. He runs for it and sees an open       
          door with chatter coming from inside. He runs into-             
          
          
          INT. TEA ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          A dead end! Several startled OLD WOMEN look up from their
          Majong. One of them instantly recognizes Saul-
          
                                 MRS. CORBER
                    Solly Silver?!?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me!
          
          The Budlofsky and Matheson bursts into the room. Saul           
          looks around, sees a teapot and grabs it. He hurls it at        
          Matheson and nails him in the face. The tea pot shatters        
          and hot water pours all over his face and hand.                 
          
                                                                    89

                    AHH!!! FUCK!!!                                        
          
          Budlofsky GRABS Saul and knees him in the balls.                
          
                                 SAUL

                                   BUDLOFSKY                              
                    Yeah!                                                 
          

          Budlofsky punches Saul in the face.                             
          
          CUT TO BLACK

          Dale hustles towards the entrance of the building when he       
          sees several police cars parked outside, their lights           
          flashing.                                                       
          
          He sees a bunch of old people gathered on the front lawn.       
          Doing his best to avoid the cops, he joins the cluster of       
          elderly.

          Dale looks, circle of people comforting a crying old         
          woman, clearly Faye Belogus. He walks over.                  
          
                                 DALE                                  
                    Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's             
                    going to be fine.                                  
          
          Dale walks off, determined.                                  
          
          
          INT. THE BARN - SOON AFTER                                   
          
          Saul wakes up but can't see anything. From his POV we see    
          tape get ripped off his eyes and mouth.                      
          
                                   SAUL                                
                    ARRGGGHHH!!!                                       
          
          Saul sees a BUDLOFSKY wielding a knife. He struggles and     
          realizes that his arms and legs are bound. Saul closes       
          his eyes, assuming he's about to die.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                         
                           (whispers to himself)
                    Fuck. I regret everything.                         
          
          BUDLOFSKY cuts the tape away from Saul's legs.               
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                           
                    Get up.
          
          Saul gets up and hops out of the car. He looks around and    
          see that he is in a LARGE BARN. Saul notices SIX THUGS       
          talking as they move bricks of weed and cocaine into a       
          van.                                                         
          
          Matheson appears and looks at Saul with smoldering           
          hatred. Saul sees that his face and neck were burnt from     
          the tea and the broken shards of pot cut his cheek.          
          
                                 SAUL                                  
                    Oh fuck. That looks painful.                       
          
          Matheson walks over, lowers to one knee, and punches him     
          straight in the balls.                                       
          
                                   SAUL (CONT'D)                       
                    EEEHH!!!                                           
          
          Matheson whips out his gun and shoves it in Saul's mouth.    
          Budlofsky taps Matheson on the shoulder.                     
          
                                                                    91
          
          
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                                
                    Don't. Ted wants him.                                 
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Fine.                                                 
          
          Matheson looks at the wheezing Saul, curled over by his         
          feet, and punches him in the back of the head.                  
          
          Matheson pokes Saul in the back with his gun, ushering          
          him towards the corner of the barn. They come to an old         
          TRAP DOOR. Matheson opens the hatch and they descend.           
          
          
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul is led along a narrow tunnel. As they reach the end,       
          Saul's eyes go wide. He enters the same massive metal           
          room that the government used in the 30s (at the                
          beginning of the movie)...only now it is rather worn
          down, and filled with HUNDREDS OF HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                           (breath-taken)
                    El Dorado.
          
          Matheson urges Saul through the dense forest of weed,           
          passing several of Ted's thugs, the hum of the giant grow       
          lights filling the air.                                         
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                            
                    Dude, look at all this weed.                          
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Shut the fuck up and keep moving.                     
          
          As Matheson ushers Saul through the foliage, Saul notices       
          a strange suit that resembles an old fashioned scuba            
          diving uniform (the one from the 1930s intro) hanging on        
          a wall.                                                         
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    What the hell is that?                                
          
          They arrive at a door. Matheson opens it and shoves Saul        
          in, causing him to almost trip.                                 
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                            
                    Ow.                                                   
          
          It is the same room Private Miller was in. Matheson shuts       
          the door.

          BAM! Dale kicks open Red's door and dashes into Red's,          
          ready for anything.                                             
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Hello? Anyone here? Red?                              
          
          Dale starts looking around. He hears music and then sees        
          he's stepping in a pool of blood.                               
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)                            
                    Oh my god.                                            
          
          Dale follows the music into the bathroom.                       
          
          
          INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS                                
          
          Dale enters and is shocked to see Red lying on the floor,       
          clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and          
          beer in the other. The music is coming from a small boom        
          box.

          Red turns toward Dale and picks up a kitchen knife with         
          his bloody hand.

          Red drops the knife and then takes a puff of his joint          
          and a sip of his beer.

                    base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail               
                    on him. I'm going to get him back.                    
          
          Red stares intensely at Dale.                                   
          
                                 RED

          Red heroic-ish-ly rises from the floor. He hobbles over         
          to the hall and opens a cabinet on the wall. Dale looks         
          in and sees several hand guns inside.                           
          
                                 RED (CONT'D)

          INT/EXT. RED'S CAR - NIGHT                                      
          
          Dale and Red are in Red's car, a FORD FIESTA, driving           
          through the countryside. Dale stops the car 100 yards           
          from the barn.                                                  
          
                                                                  94

                    This is awesome! We're so gonna show                
                    those motherfuckers. Think they can kill            
                    me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll.             
          
          Red gets out and walks to the drivers side. Dale gets         
          out, gun in hand. Red gets in the drivers seat.               
          
                                 DALE

                    So, this is the backside of the farm. If            
                    you stay low in the grass you should be             
                    fine. If someone is shooting at you with            
                    an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes              
                    you harder to hit.

                    You're not coming to help?

                    Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I           
                    was in shock before, but the air on the             
                    drive cleared my mind, I should get to              
                    the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs,               
                    right? I got shot in the best spot                  
                    possible. I could have a long and                   
                    fruitful life ahead of me. Full of                  
                    possibilities. Go get `em, slugger.

                    Saul?

                    I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that             
                    hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or           
                    just take it or whatever. Good luck,

          Red drives off. Dale takes a deep breath, clenches his        
          gun, and starts cautiously moving towards the barn. He        
          checks to make sure his safety is off and he's ready to       
          fight. Dale sneaks up on the building and pears in            
          between two boards. He sees Budlofsky supervising as the      
          thugs load the van.

          Budlofsky is about to light a cigarette, when SUDDENLY          
          Dale does a jumping role into the burn and then quickly         
          scampers to his feet and puts a gun to THUG 1's head.           
          
                                 DALE

          BLAM! Budlofsky shoots Thug 1 in the chest.

          Dale drops his gun and puts his hands up.

          Budlofsky points his gun at Thug 2.

                    everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch

          The thugs start bringing Dale towards the hatch. Suddenly       
          one of them motions for the other to stop, feeling              
          something on Dale's back.

                    We're not losers! We did that car chase.
                    That was all you, man! You got away from
                    the cops. I've watched, like, nine

                    chases and I've never seen a guy get

                    the impossible.
          
          Suddenly, they both hear someone coming. The door opens.

          He looks Dale and Saul up and down, then shuts the door.
          Dale sits down and thinks, but is disturbed by his belt
          buckle, which is digging into his gut.
          
                                 DALE

                    Perfect! Now rub your wrists against my
                    belt! My belt buckle'll cut the tape. Do
                    it! This is it!
          
          Saul is hesitant, but awkwardly gets in position anyway.

          In an unavoidably sexual-looking motion, Saul begins to
          gyrate against Dale's belt buckle.

          men. The acknowledge they understand. He holds up a             
          flashlight and flashes three times. From the opposing           
          side of the barn two other flashlights blink back. They         
          all get up and start to slowly move towards the barn.

                    using my mouth.
          
          Dale drops to his knees and starts gnawing at the tape on
          Saul's hands. Suddenly, they hear approaching footsteps.

                    What? No! What if you actually cough?
          
          Dale stands up just as Matheson walks in, gun drawn. Dale       
          looks at Saul and notices that he's managed to free his
          hands.
          
          Dale COUGHS TWICE. Saul shoots him a worried look and
          shakes his head. Matheson notices. Saul COUGHS TWICE.           
          Dale shoots him a confused look. Saul motions at him and
          COUGHS TWICE MORE.

          ground, specks of blood hitting Saul as he dives
          forwards, TACKLING Matheson into the wall!                      
          
          The Matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting Dale's       
          motionless body. Saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it.
          Matheson gets to his feet. Saul turns and-                      
          
          BLAM! He shoots Matheson in the gut.

                      One, two, three!                                   
          
          Carol and Ted pop up and unload their guns, hitting            
          several of their assailants. They watch in horror as           
          several more creep in through the hole the Escalade made.      
          
                                   CAROL (CONT'D)                        
                      You go down. I'll take care of this.               
          
          Ted nods as Carol steps out from behind her cover and          
          nails several assassins.                                       
          
          RAT-A-TAT-TAT!!! Carol is shot several times in the            
          chest! She lurches backwards, but does not fall. Her           
          bullet proof vest has taken the bullets.                       
          
                                   CAROL (CONT'D)

          Carol continues firing and kills another attacker as Ted       
          runs for the trap door.

          Dale and Saul slowly make their way through the dense
          marijuana foliage.

          Saul suddenly GRABS Dale and pulls him down.

          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Dale and Saul both scramble along a row       
          of weed planets as bullets ricochet all around them. They       
          continue running and then stop.

          They run and turn several corners when Saul suddenly            
          trips over a dead thug.

          Dale picks up the thug's machine gun. Suddenly, a thug          
          appears behind Saul.

          Dale shoots right over Saul's shoulder and nails the thug       
          several times.

                    and I`ve killed two bad guys already.                 
          
          Saul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. Dale          
          looks at the pipe, sizes up Saul and himself, and takes a       
          deep breath.

                    I'll boost you up there and you just                  
                    fucking run for it, man.

                    you?                                                  
          
          Dale cocks his gun.                                             
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Don't worry about me.

          Saul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop        
          Dale's shoulders and tears the vent off.

          Saul lifts himself in. SUDDENLY, Dale sees Ted enter the     
          room and immediately go for his gun.

          Dale walks out from under Saul, raises his gun, and          
          unloads - RATA-TAT-TAT!!! Ted ducks as the plants around     
          him are torn asunder. Dale runs out of ammo.                 
          
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Ted shoots at Saul, who narrowly avoids    
          the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. Ted           
          redirects his attention to Dale, who is running through
          the bushes. Ted blasts off a few shots before Dale
          vanishes into the foliage.

          Saul wiggles his way through the vent. He turns a corner

          There is a skeleton wedged in the vent. A grate leading
          out is directly above the corpse. Saul squeamishly crawls
          over the skeleton.

          Thirty feet from the barn there is an air vent sticking
          out of the ground. The top flies off and Saul emerges. He
          flops onto the ground, then immediately scampers to his
          and pulls out his gun. Saul looks to the open road to
          freedom, then back at the barn.

          Dale frantically runs through the rows of plants, when       
          SUDDENLY he sees the strange scuba suit out of the corner    
          of his eye and swings his gun at it, nearly opening fire.

          Dale slows down to catch his breath, staring at the          
          strange scuba suit. Then, he gets an idea.                   
          
          ANGLE ON: Ted, quietly walking through the room              
          
          Ted raises his gun as he spins around a corner.              
          
                                 TED                                   
                    Where are you, you son-of-a-bitch?                 
          
          Ted turns another corner and sees the strange scuba suit.    
          He starts to walk past it, when he stops himself. He         
          creeps back and looks at it, suspicious. He walks closer,    
          breathing as quietly as he can, his gun clenched tightly.    
          He slowly reaches his hand out to lift the face-hatch. He    
          gently takes hold of the latch and is about to open it,      
          when-                                                        
          
          Dale jumps out from behind him and swings a FIRE             
          EXTINGUISHER at Ted's face - SLAM!!! Ted drops his gun as    
          he falls to the floor.

          Saul inches towards the barn, hearing a melee of gunfire     
          and screams as he nears it. He cautiously peers in and       
          watches as Carol shoots an assassin in the chest then        
          spins around and shoots at another assassin who              
          desperately runs with a METAL BRIEFCASE handcuffed to his    
          wrist. Carol hits him several times; he lurches over and     
          falls through the trap door. She smiles and drops her
          empty gun.                                                   
          
          Saul watches Carol as she heads towards the trap door. He
          takes a deep breath and CHARGES into the barn, unleashing    
          a barrage of bullets at her! BLAM BLAM BLAM! CLICK.

          CLICK. CLICK. None of the bullets hit her. She turns and
          sees Saul, who drops his empty gun.

          They both SCREAM in rage and CHARGE, fists flying as they
          collide. Carol whips Saul around by his collar and hurls        
          him to the ground. She runs up and kicks him in the gut,        
          time and time again.

          Saul leaps to his feet and PUNCHES Carol in the face. He        
          PUNCHES her again. She reaches for her mace, so Saul            
          kicks her in the groin and grabs it for himself, then           
          sprays her in the face.

          bruised. Dale continuously shucks and jives on the spot

          Ted rips off his shirt, revealing dozens of fearsome            
          tattoos and scars. Dale quickly picks a grow light up off       
          the ground. Ted does the same. The humming of the grow          
          lights is heard as the two men walk in a circle, squared        
          off.

          COLLAPSES in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of

                    revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted

          They take a few deep breathes and each cough a bunch.
          Suddenly, they see something moving in the rubble. RED          
          emerges, lightly crisped with his clothes on fire. He           
          roles around in the dirt trying to put himself out.

          Red pats out the flames and stands up, all charred and          
          covered in dirt.

                    makin' me feel like a broken record. Now

          They all stand up. Red puts his arms around Dale and Saul       
          for support. They start to hobble towards the forest.

          Do you think we should have looked for
          the ear? They probably could've re-                
          attached it, eh? I mean, this ear thing
          kind of fucking sucks.

          plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery
          Channel, they can actually grow ears,
          like, in a petri dish, or even on the
          side of a mouse. And you only need half
          of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch.

          to be a talk radio dude anyways? And,
          like, I never said anything, but you do
          have the voice. Like, when I didn't know
          what you did, I kind of thought you might
          have been doing cartoon voices, you know,

          wore a suit.

          afraid. He starts nervously looking back towards the

                    Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of
                    fire, and we probably each inhaled about
                    ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just,

                    I'm following him.                                   
          
                                 SAUL
                    Wait! Me too!                                        
          
          With the barn's flaming remains the only light in sight,       
          Dale and Saul run off into the endless, dark country
          side. And as enchanting music fills the air, we humbly...
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

                       W. Peter Iliff










FADE IN:

We are in the belly of a wave.
Light refracts in a constant collision of water.
SLOW MOTION, the hallucinatory prisms, like liquid
diamonds taking flight, dreamlike...


EXT.  OCEAN - DUSK

Backlit against a flaming sun a solitary SURFER glides
across the green glassy peak.  TIME IS STRETCHED until his
movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world.
Total Zen concentration.  Body weight centered, eyes
forward and on the next section.


EXT.  URBAN STREET - DUSK

SLOW MOTION ON a black sedan.
Creeping along store fronts.  Past a Winchell's.
PEOPLE splash steps down rain-washed sidewalks in DREAM
MOTION.  The sedan turns past the FIRST VIRGINIA BANK and
into an alley.


INT.  BLACK SEDAN

TWO MEN and ONE WOMAN in SUSPENDED TIME put on overcoats
and hats.  Under their hats strips of Scotch tape stretch
taut from the base of their nose to their forehead,
hideously distorting their features.  Makes them look like
human PIGS.


EXT.  OCEAN

SILVERY in this light, almost metallic, as if from some
future-scape.  The lone surfer SHREDS a long, endless
right wall.
ACCELERATING INTO REAL TIME -- as he stares into the pit,
digs in, drops into the sweet spot on the wave, hunkers
down.
His moves becoming aggressive, frenzied--


INT.  BLACK SEDAN

An M-16 clip is SMACKED into place and cocked with a
CACHACK!  Ammo clips are SNICK-SNICKED into handgun butts
and a long clip is SSSNICKED into an UZI.
Watches are checked.  The PIG NOSE people nod to each
other.


EXT.  BANK

Pig Nose #1, steals into position near the glass doors,
slams his back to the wall, weapon to cheek, breath fast.


EXT.  OCEAN

FAST NOW -- the surfboard rips a brutal gash in the face
of the wave.  The surfer TRIMS down the line, pivoting the
board and going straight down, CARVING the bottom.  He
slashes viciously back toward the lip and--

In a radical INVERTED AIR ATTACK sails SIX feet above the
wave in an explosion of water--


INT.  BANK

--BAAAAAAMMM!
Glass doors explode OPEN and Pig Nose #1 SPINS inside.  He
fires a burst into the ceiling.  BRRAAMM!!

                         PIG NOSE #1
          EVERYBODY on the floor!

PEOPLE drop.
VERY FAST HERE--
Two bandits handle BANK EMPLOYEES and customers--
Another PIG NOSE watches the door--
Pig Nose #1 moves behind counter, Uzi and canvas sack in
hand.


INT.  SURVEILLANCE VAN

Dark. Monitors SHOW SLOW SCANS of the bank INTERIOR.
Two MEN wear headphones and black windbreakers with FBI
stenciled on the back.  One watches with binoculars.

                         BINOCULARS
          Bingo.  We're on.  Let's go.
          Where's the big college
          quarterback?!  Are you with us,
          Utah?


EXT.  BANK WALL

A MAN in his twenties.  His head spins revealing rain-
slicked hair and face, eyes wide, bright.  An edgy
handsomeness to him.
He pops a stick of Wrigley's in his mouth, rests a shotgun
on one leg and leans against the wall.  He wears a
headset... through which we hear the FBI guy yelling for
him.
This is JOHNNY UTAH.

                         BINOCULARS (FILTERED)
          Utah, where the hell are ya!?

Utah takes his headset off...


INT.  BANK

Pig Nose #1 LEAPS over the counter, holds a canvas sack
filled with booty from tellers' drawers.

                         PIG NOSE #1
          Fuckin' shake it!

Pig Nose #2 nods with his snubby nose, hurries toward the
exit.


EXT.  FIRST VIRGINIA BANK

The bandits burst through the doors and sprint to the
alley where they jump into the SEDAN.  THE DRIVER, the
WOMAN PIG NOSE, punches it and the TIRES WHIRRR on the
slick pavement.
The sedan launches down the alley.

Utah running.  Like a freight train.  Splashing through a
cross-alley.  He doesn't break stride as he slams his
shoulder into a large, steel GARBAGE DUMPSTER.
DRIVING it like a football training sled into the ALLEY
where--

THE SEDAN LOCKS 'EM UP seconds too late as it SKIDS and
SLAMS into it, CRUNCHING into the brick wall and--
Still alive -- GRINDS into reverse back down the alley,
HEADLIGHTS SMASHED, it guns it backward as--

UTAH leaps over the dumpster and sprints after the car.
He has a brick in his right hand.  He cocks it back.
Johnny HEAVES the brick thirty yards and--

SMASH!  The brick EXPLODES into the windshield,
SPIDERWEBBING the glass.
Lady Pignose flinches from the glass fragments thrown into
her face.

                         LADY PIGNOSE
          Son of a bitch!

The car slews backward onto the street, slamming a parked
car.  Lady Pignose slams the thing into DRIVE, cuts the
wheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement.

UTAH hurtles from the alley.  He leaps, somehow TACKLES
the DRIVER'S door handle and is dragged along the street.
He pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips
the steering wheel hard right.

The SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota.  Utah bounces
forward, slamming into the asphalt.  Glass shards and
crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam
whistles hot.

Pig Nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped.  Can't get his
crushed door open.  The DRIVER pushes open her door.
Gropes for her pistol.  Utah springs -- no respect for a
lady.  He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and
again until the gun drops.  Utah kicks it away as the
woman collapses in pain.

Pig Nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot.  Utah
leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the
shotgun.

                         UTAH
          Halt.  FBI!

Pig Nose #1 spins.  We sense reckless anger.  He raises
the UZI.  Utah squeezes the trigger.

No death.  No blood.
Just buzzers and flashing bulbs.
Pig Nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine.
Utah's laser weapon hit the "kill zone".  Pig Nose rips
the tape off his face and the FBI CADET shakes his head in
disgust.

OBSERVERS step forward.  Bank customers.  Bank tellers.
All FBI personnel.  MEDICAL STAFF offer the woman driver
assistance.  Pig Nose #1 heads for Johnny, but is subdued
by other agents.

                         PIG NOSE #1 (FBI CADET)
          I wanna say just two words to you,
          asshole, SIMU-LATION!!!  Johnny-
          fuckin' Utah.  Guys like you will do
          anything to win!

Utah stares back in defiance.
The SURVEILLANCE van pulls up nearby.
BINOCULARS runs out and pinches two fingers together,
right in Johnny's face.

                         BINOCULARS
          This far, Utah!  You're this far
          from being the most overqualified
          guy Burger King ever had.  Get me?!

                         UTAH
          Yes sir.  Sir?

                         BINOCULARS
          What?

Johnny gestures to the car.

                         UTAH
          I did stop the perpetrators.

Utah turns to go.  As he passes he casually raises his
laser-shotgun and re-triggers Pig Nose's flak vest.
LIGHTS AND BUZZERS.
Pig Nose explodes.  More agents restrain him.
Screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys.
Utah walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign
which bears the FBI SEAL and reads "Combat Village,
Quantico, Virginia."

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY

Red sky.  A luminous Pacific.  Five foot faces.  Nice
curl.  A lineup of SURFERS wait outside the break.
Silhouetted, bobbing like a pack of sea mammals.


INT./ EXT.  TAXI

A flood of orange through the windshield as the cab crawls
down Ocean Park to the sea.  CAMERA HANDHELD from the back
seat.
The driver turns to us.

                         DRIVER
          Anywhere?  You don't care?

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          Anywhere.  I've just never seen the
          ocean before.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  VENICE BEACH

JOHNNY UTAH trudging across the sand, holding his shoes.
Garment bag and a big duffel over his shoulder.
He looks silly in his dark suit, tie loosened, wearing a
turned around baseball cap.
He wiggles his toes in the sand, looks around like a kid.
A pack of BOUNCING BEAUTIES jog through frame.
Utah grins, reaches up and turns his cap around.
It reads "I Love L.A."

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING

Looking down the face of the concrete monolith at Wilshire
and Veteran.  Ant-like, Johnny Utah's tiny figure moves
toward the entrance.

                         VOICE (OVER)
          Day One in LA, special agent Utah.
          You may have been top two percent of
          your class at Quantico but you have
          exactly zero hours in the field
          here.  You know nothing...


INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - FBI BULLPEN

Supervising Agent BEN HARP leads Utah across the bullpen.
Rows of desks.  Agents sitting at computer terminals.
Data hell.  Looks like he got a job at Xerox.

                         HARP
          You know less than nothing.  If you
          even knew that you knew nothing, at
          least that would be something, but
          you don't.

                         UTAH
          Yes, sir.

Utah is wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase.  Harp is
mid-thirties, confident of stride, tanned of skin, perfect
of hair.  GQ.  Aggressive.

                         HARP
          Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?

                         UTAH
          Sir?

                         HARP
          All the food groups?  Avoiding
          sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that
          my people maintain cardiovascular
          fitness.  We stay off hard liquor,
          cigarettes...

                         UTAH
                  (poker face)
          I take the skin off chicken.

Harp glances at him, eyes narrowing.  They reach a
glassed-in compound of small offices.  Harp swings the
door open and the other agents look up as Utah enters.

                         HARP
          This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And
          you're in the bank-robbery capital
          of the world--

                         UTAH
          1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26
          percent from the year before.

                         HARP
          That's right.  And we nailed over a
          thousand of them.  We did it by
          crunching data.  Good crime-scene
          work, good lab work, good data-base
          analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a
          car once.  You getting the signal,
          special agent?

                         UTAH
          Zero distortion, sir.

He picks up a donut from someone's desk, a succulent
glazed jelly.

                         UTAH
          I love these things.

He looks right at Harp.  Takes a big fuck-you bite.

                         HARP
          You're a real blue-flame special,
          aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why
          they sent you to LA.  Must be an
          asshole shortage.

                         UTAH
          Not so far.

                                            CUT TO:

UNDERWATER

A blue field with a pulsing network of rippling lines.
VOOM!  A figure rockets down INTO FRAME in a curtain of
bubbles.  A gawky AGENT, in less than stylish FBI trunks,
flails around blindfolded looking for bricks at the bottom
of a pool.


INT.  GYMNASIUM POOL - DAY

The pool casts wavy distortions upon TWO DOZEN MEN, all
grumbling as they stand in line, wearing T-shirts with FBI
logos, sweats and sneakers.  We hear a splash, and the men
shuffle forward.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          The dolls love this baby.  It brings
          them luck when they rub it -- right
          between their buttons.

CLOSE ON tape measure wrapped around a generous belly.
PULL BACK to reveal VETERAN AGENT COREY measuring the
ample waist of ANGELO PAPPAS.  This 54 year old silver
haired Greek stands rubbing his belly like a Zulu chief.

                         COREY
          Angelo, we need a bigger tape.

                         PAPPAS
          Just read the goddamn number.

                         COREY
          Still a 46.  Maybe we can cinch it
          down, wear a girdle--

                         PAPPAS
          Screw you and this holistic fitness
          crap!  At least my arms don't flap
          in the wind.

Corey secretly squeezes his bicep as...
A whistle blows.  A broad shouldered MAN wearing an FBI
cap barks at the Greek.

                         BIG SHOULDERS
          Okay, Pappas, let's put on the
          blindfold.  Wanna see you retrieve
          at least two bricks from the bottom.

JOHNNY UTAH enters the pool area in the distance.  Says
something to one of the agents.  Is pointed toward us as--
Corey ties the blindfold and guides Pappas to the edge of
the pool.

                         PAPPAS
          I've been in the field 33 years,
          fired my piece 23 times in the line
          of duty, and I got no idea what a
          blind man fetching bricks has gotta
          do with being a Special Agent!

Johnny has walked up.  Pappas, blindfolded, turns directly
to Utah as he continues, thinking it's Corey.

                         PAPPAS
          Added to which indignity, I got
          three months left to retirement and
          they saddle me with some blue-flamer
          fresh out of Quantico for a partner.
          Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas
          or something.

                         UTAH
          The shit they pull, huh?

Pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool.
Huge backblast of water.  The other agents hoot and
holler.
Corey swears and wipes off his clipboard.
Johnny steps to the edge, looks down.
We see the blindfolded Pappas groveling along the bottom.
The other agents cheer as Pappas heads for the surface.

                         COREY
          Here he comes.  Hold up a fish,
          he'll take it right outta your hand.

Pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters
for breath.  He grabs the edge and angrily slaps two
bricks on the tiles.  He rips off the blindfold looks up
and frowns.

A HAND ENTERS FRAME to help him up.  Pappas takes it and
Johnny hauls him on deck.

                         COREY
          Hey Shamu, this is your guy.

Pappas eyes the new agent warily.  Extends his hand.

                         PAPPAS
          Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.

                         UTAH
          Punk.  Quarterback Punk.

                         PAPPAS
                  (grinning)
          Welcome to Sea World, kid.


INT.  SEDAN - DAY

SERIES OF TIGHT SHOTS
ECU sweep hand of a dive watch clicks through the
seconds.
Magnum shells are fed into a pump shotgun.
Velcro straps of Second Chance body armor are fastened.
White gloves are pulled snug over strong hands.
A silk tie is straightened.  A shotgun slide is cocked.
The sweep hand approaches the twelve.
A LATEX MASK is pulled over the back of a man's head.

                         VOICE
          The little hand says...

The mask turns into FULL CLOSE-UP.  It is RONALD REAGAN.

                         REAGAN
          ... let's rock and roll.


INT.  BANK OF AMERICA

Business as usual.  The scene so normal you know something
is about to happen.  An exiting MAN stuffs bucks into his
wallet, reaching for the door which--
SLAMS INWARD.  He is hit by a wall of EX-PRESIDENTS.

REAGAN charges in with his buddies RICHARD M. NIXON,
LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON and JOHN F. KENNEDY.
Reagan throws the poor guy skidding across the floor.
Nixon buttstrokes a guard, hard in the nuts, with his 12
gauge.
The other guard goes for his holster -- finds himself
facing three shotguns and one very large handgun.
Reagan sights down the pistol.

                         REAGAN
          Use a gun, go to heaven.

The guard freezes.  White and sweaty.
Tricky Dick slips up to him and collects the pistol.
Kennedy covers the stunned customers.
Johnson backs up against the door jam, watching the
street, and the sedan idling at the curb.

                         REAGAN
          EVERYBODY FREEZE!!  That's right.
          ALL TELLERS step back from the
          counter!  Hands on heads!  MOVE!!

Nixon and Reagan move quickly to the counter as the
tellers comply.

                         REAGAN
          Everybody else on the floor!  Do it!
          On the floor, let's go.

                         NIXON
          SUCK LINOLEUM, BITCH!!  You got
          earwax?!

Nixon grabs a stunned woman by the arm and hurls her to
the floor.
She lands hard.  Everyone is on the deck by now.
The Presidents move fast.
Reagan leaps onto the counter.  Stands up where he can see
all.
Nixon hurdles to tellers' side and they start moving down
the line together.  Reagan controlling the room as Nixon
quickly empties the tellers' cash drawers into the sack.
His hands move like lightning.

                         REAGAN
          Just stay cool.  Everybody stay
          cool.  Heads down.  Eyes down.  The
          money's insured--

TIGHT ON -- MONEY flying into the sack.

                         REAGAN
          -- it's not worth dying for.
          Another 45 seconds of your time.
          That's all.  Then -- Whoa, Tricky
          Dick!

Nixon pulls a pack of twenties back out of the bag and
tosses it to the BANK MANAGER.  Who reflexively catches
it.
Then drops it like a hot-potato just before--
It EXPLODES into a cloud of blue ink.  The manager is dyed
blue.
Burnt money showers on the terrified customers.

LBJ looks at his watch and WHISTLES.
The bandits sprint for the front doors.
Kennedy exits first, followed by Reagan.
LBJ pauses under the surveillance camera, drops his
trousers and MOONS.  Thank you is written across his white
butt.

BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITOR--

High angle, distorted wide shot.  LBJ hoists his pants and
splits, followed out by Nixon, who exits backward with the
famous double peace-sign held high overhead.

IMAGE FREEZES.  Victorious Nixon, grainy... something from
a time warp.  The image SUDDENLY GOES INTO HIGH-SPEED
REVERSE.  The bank robbery sequence zips backward.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          Twenty-seven banks in three years.
          In and out in 90 seconds.  Nobody
          ever gets shot.  We're talking solid
          professionals.

WE ARE IN--


INT.  BANK CRIME SCENE - LATER

UTAH & PAPPAS are watching a monitor in the glassed-in
office.  The robbery REPLAYS on grainy BLACK & WHITE
videotape.
The bandits barge in, raise shotguns and order everybody
to the floor.

                         UTAH
          Good move.

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah, they control the room well.
          Stick strictly to the cash drawers.

VIDEO TAPE -- Utah is reverse-scanning.  The bandits walk
BACKWARD into the bank.  The explosion of blue ink is
sucked back into the pack of money, then leaps back into
President Nixon's hand.

                         UTAH
          They don't go for the vault?

                         PAPPAS
          Never go for the vault.  They never
          get greedy.

                         UTAH
          Smart.  You burn time in the vault.

                         PAPPAS
          Reagan usually drives.  Stolen
          switch car, they leave it running at
          the curb, looks parked from a
          distance.  When they run, they dump
          the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean
          vanish.

Utah stops the video, now FAST-FORWARDING it, stopping
where President Nixon separates the exploding "dye pack"
planted with the money, before he tosses it aside.

                         UTAH
          Surgical.  Look at them separate the
          dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know
          their jobs.

                         PAPPAS
          The Ex-Presidents are the best I've
          seen, kid.

Outside the windowed partition POLICE OFFICERS interview
frightened customers.
Hotshot agents MUNOZ and COLE enter from the main floor of
the bank.  Think they're very slick.

                         MUNOZ
          Anytime you two are finished jerking
          off watching MTV I need to get a
          look at that tape.

                         COLE
                  (sloppy grin)
          Hey, Pappas, you tell the kid your
          theory on the Presidents?

                         PAPPAS
          Just take the tape, Cole.

Now Munoz starts to smile.

                         MUNOZ
          Hang ten, Pappas, like totally
          rad...
                  (to Utah)
          I gotta tell ya, the department
          loves it.

                         UTAH
          What's he talking about, Angelo?

Harp raps glass.  Cole and Munoz look sharp.
Harp enters addressing Pappas and Utah.

                         HARP
          They found the drop car up on
          Mulholland.  I want you two to go
          work it.

                         PAPPAS
          What?  Now I'm working the drop car?
          Who's handling the scene here?

                         HARP
          Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting
          them run with the ball for a while.

Cole and Munoz gloat.

                         PAPPAS
          Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case
          for two years.

                         HARP
                  (zeroing in on
                   Pappas)
          That's the point, isn't it?

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's
          dick the old guys, huh, Harp?

                         HARP
          Supervising Special Agent, Harp.
          Now I want you to go work the drop
          car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?

The Greek rises like a proud bull.

                         PAPPAS
          Sure.  No problem.  How about your
          office?  Your office need vacuuming?
          We could do that too.

Pappas and Utah move toward the door.  It's a tight
squeeze as they pass Cole and Munoz.  Especially Pappas.

                         PAPPAS
          Excuse me.

Read as fuck you.


EXT.  MULHOLLAND SCENIC TURNOUT - NIGHT

The diamond field of LA glitters below.  The small parking
area off Mulholland is filled with squad cars.  Red and
blue disco.
A flock of UNIFORMS milling about a non-descript CHEVY.


INT.  SEDAN FRONT SEAT

FLASHLIGHT BEAM prowls the interior, stopping on a small
printed card, folded like a pup tent, left upon the bench
seat.  It reads "Sanitized For Your Protection."

                         PAPPAS
          Cute huh?  They love to fuck with
          us.

UTAH & PAPPAS pull their heads out of the sedan.  Forensic
expert, HALSEY, stands behind them.

                         PAPPAS
          Don't tell me, let me guess.  The
          switch-car was stolen this morning...
                  (Halsey is nodding
                   his head)
          They vacuumed and 409'd the
          interior, did the windows, emptied
          the ashtrays...

                         HALSEY
          Yeah, the usual drill.

Utah pulls on a rubber glove and lifts the card off the
seat.  Studies it.  Talks to Halsey like Halsey's the one
that just out of Quantico, not Utah.

                         UTAH
          Could've taken their gloves off
          before setting that card.  Laser it
          for prints.  Maybe held it to his
          teeth -- check the edges for saliva.
                  (a beat)
          Today was a scorcher.  This Chevy
          doesn't have air conditioning...

                         HALSEY
          Sweat secretions in the seatbacks?

                         PAPPAS
          You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me
          know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under
          the seat while you're at it.
                  (looks at his watch)
          Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's
          still young... you can solve this
          case and start on another one.

                         UTAH
          Well, what're your ideas on these
          guys?

                         PAPPAS
          Forget about it, kid.  They're
          ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie
          Mormon affirmative action assholes
          handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so
          I must be senile, right?  They
          better get me out before I start
          pissing myself in public.  Drooling.
          It would look bad for the Bureau,
          right?

                         UTAH
          So you're gonna coast to retirement,
          when you could nail these guys and
          go out with come dignity.

                         PAPPAS
          You watch your fucking mouth!
                  (pounds his chest)
          Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal
          of Honor right here!

The two men glare at each other.  Utah looks away.

                         UTAH
          Sorry.

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah.  That was thirty years ago
          anyway.
                  (stares out at the
                   bright horizon)
          L.A.'s changed a lot since then.
          The air got dirty and the sex got
          clean.
                  (after a beat)
          So you want to nail the Ex-
          Presidents?  Be a big hero?

                         UTAH
          Yeah.  What's your theory?

                         PAPPAS
          The fucking punks are surfers.

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - BULLPEN - NIGHT

Dark, lit by the TV at the far end of the bullpen.  PAPPAS
and UTAH sit in front of the flickering Sony in the big
empty room.  Angelo punches a button on the VCR.

ON THE SCREEN--

LBJ turns his back to the fish-eye lens, drops trousers
and moons the camera.  Thank you.
Angelo FREEZES on LBJ'S butt.

                         PAPPAS
          I'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our
          face.  Lookit the tan on this guy.

The young agent looks forward.
Stares at the white inscribed butt bracketed by deep
bronze tan lines.

                         UTAH
          Oh well he must be a surfer.

                         PAPPAS
          Shutup, you might learn somethin'
          you're not careful... So last year
          Nixon scuffs a counter going over.
          There was a soil sample.  Non-
          specific mud traces of asphalt,
          oils, blah, blah... sand and...
          carnuba wax.  So I became a wax
          expert.  There's 80 some uses for
          this stuff, something like five
          hundred products.

He tosses Utah a ream of computer printout.  Utah scans
lists of brand names.

                         UTAH
          Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax?
          Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his
          mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in
          it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe
          scuffs the counter.

                         PAPPAS
          The lab made three possible matches,
          this was one of 'em.

Pappas opens his desk drawer, takes something out and
throws it to Johnny.  A pastel blue hockey puck wrapped in
cellophane.
A block of "Mr. Zog's Sex Wax".

                         UTAH
                  (reading)
          Sex wax?  You're not into kinky
          shit, are you Angelo?

                         PAPPAS
          Surfers use it on their boards.
          They rub sand into it for traction.

                         UTAH
          Thanks for the tip.  I needed this
          knowledge.

Pappas shoves a thick file folder toward Utah.

                         PAPPAS
          Now lookit the dates on the
          robberies.  This is strictly a
          summer job for these guys.

Johnny leafs through it.

                         UTAH
          ... Four months.  June to October.
          Mmmm...same the year before.

                         PAPPAS
          Another month and we don't see 'em
          again 'til next summer.

Utah stares at Angelo as it dawns.  Grins suddenly.

                         UTAH
          They're traveling the rest of the
          year on the money, going where the
          waves are...

Pappas starts to smile.  Suddenly, he jumps up onto his
desk, gets down in a speed-crouch, arms extended.

                         PAPPAS
                  (to one and all)
          The Ex-Presidents rip off banks to
          finance their endless summer!

Johnny watches, grinning.  The night security GUARD walks
in.  Utah turns to the guard, shrugs.

                         UTAH
          I think he needs a vacation.

The guard nods understanding.

INT.  SURFSHOP - MALIBU PIER - DAY

Long stack-up rack of gleaming SURFBOARDS.
A HAND reaches in, pulling out a board from the middle of
the deck.

JOHNNY UTAH hefts it.  Sights along it.  Trying to look
familiar with alien equipment.  Behind him is a whip-thin
15 YEAR OLD SALESMAN.  Nut-brown with platinum hair,
jammed day-glo shorts, sleeveless T-shirt, unlaced Ug-
boots.

                         15
          Highest performance, very kind.  If
          you want to get aggro, man, this
          stick can handle your best rage.
          Where you surf?

                         UTAH
          I don't.

                         15
          Whoa!!  Back up!  This's a 5'6" tri-
          fin squash-tail thruster.  You'd eat
          major shit on this, dude.

ACROSS THE ROOM we see Pappas trying on purple wraparound
sunglasses.

The salespunk pulls down a wide board with a garish
firebird paint scheme.  Like a lowrider flame-job.  The
logo reads "Dance with the Universe."

                         15
          Here, you need a rhino chaser like
          this one to learn on.  Good board.
          I mean for a pig board.

Utah hefts the board.  Scowls.  Hates anything he's not
great at.

PAPPAS sets his purchases on a counter: the glasses, some
plutonium-pink shorts, T-shirts, sun-block.  The GIRL
behind the counter is sixteen, barely contained in a
macrame bikini-top and "Dolphin" shorts.  Angelo picks up
a package of Sex Wax from a rack.  Sniffs it.

                         PAPPAS
                  (reading the label)
          "Best for your stick", huh?  This
          might not be enough.  I better get
          two.

The girl stifles a grin.  Thinks he's cute.  At the other
end of the counter, 15 is ringing up Utah's board.

                         15
          Hey, man, guys your age learning to
          surf, it's cool, there's nothing
          wrong with it.

                         UTAH
          I'm twenty-five.

                         15
          See that's what I'm saying, it's
          never too late.

Utah picks up the board and moves to leave.

                         15
          Hope you stay with it.  Surfin's
          the source.  It'll change your life.
          Swear to God.


EXT.  MALIBU PIER - DAY

Utah and Pappas walking back to the car.
Two FBI agents in suits and ties walking with a day-glo
orange surfboard.  Surreal image.  The ocean shimmers in
B.G.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny, it's the only way.

                         UTAH
          Why can't I just walk around with
          this thing under my arm and act
          stoned?  Ask a few questions.

Angelo stops at the railing, points toward the ocean.

                         PAPPAS
          Look.  Look at them out there.

LONG LENS on packs of surfers sitting outside.  Bobbing
slowly.  Hunched like sea birds.  Waiting for an unseen
sign.  Disappearing and reappearing beyond the break.

                         PAPPAS
          They're like some kind of tribe.
          Got their own language.  You can't
          just walk up to these guys.  You've
          got to get out there.  Learn some
          moves.  Get into their head.  Pick
          up the speech.

                         UTAH
          Angelo, this stuff is for little
          rubber people who don't shave yet.

                         PAPPAS
          It's all balance, right?  And
          coordination.  How hard can it be?

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  SURFRIDER BEACH - DAY

WHAAAAAM!  Johnny is CLOBBERED by a wave.
He's flipped off his board and hits the water face-first
as the wave crashes over him.  Other surfers steer clear.

PAPPAS lounges in a beach chair in his plutonium pink
shorts, purple Vuarnet's and a T-shirt emblazoned with
"Surf This" across the chest.  A picnic basket sits close
at hand.  He winces at Utah's wipeout.  Shouts from his
beach chair.

                         PAPPAS
          I think you gotta hit them straight
          on!

                         UTAH
                  (out of breath)
          Got it...

UTAH holds the tip steady, gouges the face of a wave and
squirts out the other side.  Another wave rises and Utah
glides up over the hump.  He clears the swell and the
ocean suddenly smooths out like a giant lake.  Triumphant
over having made the lineup, he sits up on the board, and
falls over.

PAPPAS slices a green apple, some feta cheese and eats off
the knife.

UTAH climbs back on his board.  WHISTLES and HOOTS sound
as SURFERS spot a new swell.  Utah watches as the regulars
start catching rides.  Suddenly he feels like a lost dog
on a busy freeway.
A young LOCAL in a neon wetsuit slashes past him, inches
away.

                         LOCAL
          Outta the way, you dick!

Another, shredding viciously, is blasting toward him.

                         LOCAL 2
          Move it, kook!

Johnny paddles rapidly, ducks under.
Sees another, bigger wave coming.
Pissed off... at himself, at the downy-cheeked hotshots,
at the frustration, he turns his board around and starts
paddling hard.
He somehow gets the soles of his feet in contact with the
top of the board, then struggles up.  He's standing --
sort of.
Arms pinwheeling, he topples in a nasty crash...
Right in front of a SHAVED-HEAD SURFER on full
afterburner.

Johnny vanishes in an explosion of spray.  His board
SHOOTS OUT.
It SMASHES SIDEWAYS INTO RAZORHEAD.
The guy does an ugly endo.
Utah comes up GASPING for air, arms flailing.
His board, floating a few feet away, tugging at his ankle.
He drapes his torso across the board and pants for breath.
Razorhead, already back on his board, paddles over.
Points to a small dent in the fiberglass.

                         RAZORHEAD
          You dinged my board, kook!!

Utah looks up in apology as--
A CRUSHING RIGHT HOOK SMACKS HIS FACE!
Knocks him under.
Razorhead pulls a KNIFE from a sheath held by a thong
around his neck.  As Johnny surfaces, Razorhead slashes in
a vicious arc--
Severing Utah's leash, close to the board.
His flame-job surfboard bobs away.

                         RAZORHEAD
          Politeness counts, ASSHOLE!

The surf punk plunges under a wave, disappearing.

                         UTAH
          Goddamn son-of-a--

Before Utah can finish, another wave engulfs him and he
tumbles to shore, Razorhead nowhere to be seen.

ON PAPPAS as Johnny's flame-job board washes in at his
feet.  He calmly picks it up as Utah staggers INTO FRAME
out of the knee-deep whitewash.  Johnny rubs his jaw.
Spits blood.

                         PAPPAS
          Kid, maybe this ain't your sport.

Utah grabs the board out of Pappas' hands and stalks off
across the beach.


INT.  UTAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Johnny dead asleep.  Silence.  Then BRRRRR!!
He jacknifes up like he just took 20,000 volts.  His eyes
read panic.  He rolls up, legs scissor against tangled
sheets and he collapses over empty boxes.  He stumbles
like a blind man through the mess until he finds--
A tiny Indianapolis Colts FOOTBALL HELMET with a digital
clock for eyes.  5:00 a.m.  Johnny emits a drawn out
groan.


EXT.  OCEAN - DAWN

Deafening BOOM as a monster wave CRASHES below a sky the
color of slate.  A distant Pacific storm has brought the
swell.  10 foot faces.  Glassy, green walls the size of
houses beckoning from beyond the soup.

A lone FIGURE bobbing out beyond the break.
The surfer disappears behind the swell.
Then REAPPEARS, grinning across the smooth offshore
barrel.

UTAH wearing a wetsuit stands beside his surfboard,
craning forward to get a better look.
The surfer is a WOMAN.
She moves with liquid grace, in perfect harmony with the
sea, long hair flying out behind her.  She undulates like
a dancer.
Dipping, carving, slicing, making it look sooooo easy.
Johnny shakes his head.  Oh man, if she can do it...

                         UTAH
          Fuck it.

He stands, grabs his board and heads out into the icy
foam.

OCEAN BREAK
A horizon of whitecaps churn behind him.
He lies on his board, rising and dropping with the swell.
So far so good.  He spots a wave.  A fluid gray-green
house rising, forever rising.  Utah turns.  Paddles.  The
house catching him, lifting him high upon its roof.

Utah is committed.  He gets to his feet as his board
slices along the lip.  He peers over the falls, down the
face -- holy shit!  -- it looks like Niagara.  He loses
balance and spirals airborne, falling bullseye into the
IMPACT ZONE.  The entire force of the wave crashing upon
him, plunging him down into the--

WASHING MACHINE (UNDERWATER)

where he SPINS like a whirling dervish, LASHED to a
slamdancing surfboard at the mercy of God.
He is held prisoner in a grey-green churning nightmare,
like a six-ton pit bull has him by the neck, shaking him.
He looks around.  Can't tell up from down.
WHAM!  His head slams into the bottom -- rocks and sand.
Stunned, he struggles toward the light, finally bursting
to the--

SURFACE.  Gasping for breath.
The good news is he's breathing, the bad news is he's
surfaced in the impact zone.  Another wave crashes down,
stuffing him back into the washing machine.  Leaving no
sign of life in the white froth.  The orangeade surfboard
launches high into the sky, spinning like a misfiring
Trident missile, trailing its broken leash like a kite
tail.

IN THE WASHING MACHINE, Utah tumbles in a cold green hell.
His chest is convulsing, needing air now.
Suddenly a FIGURE lunges down INTO FRAME.
A hand snatches a fistful of his hair and yanks him
toward--

THE SURFACE.  The WOMAN SURFER bursts through the foam.
Grabs her board for leverage.  Hauls Utah's head above the
water with one strong arm.
He is choking, coughing, slapping fatigued arms against
the surf, panic registering in his movements.

                         WOMAN SURFER
                  (yelling above the
                   roar)
          Swim, goddammit!  Come on!  Move
          it!

The woman gets her board under one of his arms for support
and sidekicks fiercely into the wave, holding him in a
painful grip.
With powerful strokes, she helps Utah make it to calmer
water outside the break.  The big waves, just forming up,
lift them and drop them as they pass.  Muted thunder when
the waves hit the beach.  She drags him half onto her
surfboard.
Practically slamming his face into the board.
He's coughing out saltwater.

ON THE WOMAN, our first good look at her.
She is EXQUISITE.  Hair slicked tight to her high-
cheekboned face, she looks sleek and feral, with eyes that
burn bright.
Especially when she's pissed.

                         WOMAN
          Look crazy son of a bitch!  You
          wanna commit suicide, you do it
          someplace else!

She undoes her leash and swims rapidly off, returning in a
few seconds with Johnny's board.  He takes it from her and
flops over it, still coughing.
Wipes at the salt-snot running out of his nose.
There is a cut over his eye from when he re-arranged the
rocks on the bottom.

                         WOMAN
          Look at this pig-board piece-a-shit.
          It's still got the price tag on it,
          for Chrissakes.  What'd you do, buy
          it yesterday?  You've got no
          business out here whatsoever.

Still gagging and gasping, Johnny manages a goofy grin.

                         UTAH
          Well, I saw you and--

                         WOMAN
          Yeah, you saw me and you figured
          that if a mere girl can do it, a big
          strong stud like you shouldn't have
          any problem.  Right?!  Well you
          figured wrong, dork!

She yanks her board around and strokes powerfully away
from him.

                         UTAH
          Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?

                         WOMAN
                  (without turning)
          Carefully, tough guy.  Very
          carefully.

                         UTAH
                  (yelling now)
          My name's Johnny Utah!

                         WOMAN
          Who cares!

                         UTAH
          I'm telling you so when you look
          back on this moment, you can
          think... there was this guy named
          Utah and he was pretty much a dork
          but maybe not such a bad person and
          I let him drown in conditions he had
          no business being in whatsoever...
          when I could have easily helped him.

Johnny calmly starts paddling toward shore.
Thundering white water pounding the rocks ahead of him.
He's stoic in the face of certain death.

                         UTAH
                  (over his shoulder,
                   gamely)
          Bye.

                         WOMAN
          Wait!  Jesus Christ!
                  (swimming back to
                   him)
          You're fucking crazy, you know that?
          You go in there you're gonna eat it
          on the rocks.  Here, follow me.

The woman paddles parallel to the shore and Utah pumps
along behind her.  She gets him away from the rocks, then
starts watching the incoming swell, timing it to the lull
between sets...

                         WOMAN
          Go when I say.  But stay down.  Just
          lie on the board.  Alright, let's
          go!

Utah paddles rapidly, following her, watching what she
does.
He is borne up by a low glassy wall.
He bellyboards all the way into the mushy shorebreak.
Tumbles.  Stands unsteadily, grabbing his board.  Runs
clumsily out of the retreating foam as another wave comes,
sucking water out.
On terra firma he looks back to see the woman kick-out
gracefully and disappear beyond the wave.

He flops on the sand.  Shivering.  Miserable.


EXT.  COAST HIGHWAY - LATER

LONG LENS... the woman is peeling off her wetsuit next to
a BATHTUB PORSCHE that needs a paint job.  Her board is
propped in the passenger seat.  Stereo is pumping.

UTAH WATCHES THROUGH BINOCULARS from 50 yards up the road.

THE WOMAN, in a bikini, towels off briskly.
Swimmer's shoulders.  Long muscular legs.  Lean and mean.
She jumps into the car without bothering to open the door.
Looks at her watch -- her manner is late, in a hurry.
Through the tiny windshield we watch her shimmy and shake
as she pulls her bottoms off and struggles into something
else, not too concerned about the morning traffic right
next to her.
She pulls on a T-shirt and them performs a Houdini act to
extract the bikini top out of one sleeve hole.

UTAH WATCHES IMPASSIVELY.  He starts his car and pulls out
onto PCH to follow as the bathtub Porsche zooms past.


EXT.  NEPTUNE'S NET

Utah cruises up slowly, pulls off the road.
Up ahead the Porsche turns into the parking lot of
NEPTUNE'S NET, a Coast Highway hangout that serves high-
grade steamed sea-critters and beer to low-grade road
trash, bikers and surfers.

Lean-and-Mean, wearing jeans and T-shirt, jumps out of the
Porsche.  She hurries to the door of the Net, unlocking it
for a couple of Mexican cooks -- helpers wearing
expressions like they wait like this for her every day.

UTAH puts down his binoculars and jots the Porsche's
license number down on a Tastee-Freeze bag.  867CDH.

Green glow washes the intent faces of Utah and Pappas as
MISS DEER data specialist, enters 867 CDH into her
computer.
She is purebred American Indian, strong featured and
beautiful.
The screen freezes and the hard disk churns.
The DMV rap sheet scrolls down the screen.

                         PAPPAS
          This is your surfer contact?
          Female.  Blond hair.  Green eyes.

          Hmm, not bad, Utah.

                         UTAH
          Tyler Ann Endicott.  Born 11-27-64.

The rap sheet scrolls and scrolls and scrolls.  There is
something frightening about the length of this file.

                  (reading from the

Pappas crowds over Johnny's shoulder, reading.

                         PAPPAS
          This is great.  She ties some guy
          up.  Nude.  Leaves the scene and
          fails to return for 24 hours.  No
          convection.

                         MISS DEER
          Gotta avoid the rope tricks, Johnny.

Utah gives her a "very funny" look.  More data scrolls
forth.

                         UTAH
          What else they got on her?  I still
          haven't found anything I can really
          use.  I gotta find an approach, a
          way in -- here we go...
                  (he reads)

EXT.  NEPTUNE'S NET - DAY

A fat biker pulls out on a loud Harley (like there's any
other kind).  The place is almost empty in the weekend
lull between lunch and dinner.
Utah's car pulls in off PCH.


INT.  NEPTUNE'S NET

Tyler Endicott is working the counter.  She jams an order
on the wheel and turns TO US.

                         TYLER
          Next!  Oh, no.

REVERSE ON Johnny standing there.  Her only customer.

                         TYLER
          What do you want?

                         UTAH
          Shrimp and fries.

                         TYLER
          I mean, what do you want?  What are
          you doing hanging around here.

                         UTAH
                  (very serious)
          I need you to teach me.

                         TYLER
          Gimme a break.
                  (to cook)
          One shrimp and fries to go!
                  (to Johnny)
          Anything to drink?

                         UTAH
          I'm serious.

                         TYLER
          I can see that.  But forget it.
          Stick to tennis, or whatever you're
          good at.  Miniature golf.  Here,
          your number's 37.

                         UTAH
          Well, I'm just gonna go back out
          there till I catch on to it or break
          my neck.

She's looking at him.  This guy's nuts.  She laughs.

                         TYLER
          What is it?  You all of a sudden got
          this bug you had to go surfing?
          This is a line, right?

                         UTAH
          No, no.  See, all my life I've done
          things for other people.  In high
          school I played football because my
          old man expected me to.  Then my
          parents always figured I'd go to law
          school, so I did.  Football
          scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta
          Kappa--

                         TYLER
          This gonna take long?

                         UTAH
          Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks,
          right?
                  (he leans forward, a
                   little awkward)
          But two years ago they got killed in
          a car wreck and I just suddenly
          realized all my goals had been their
          goals.  And I hadn't been living my
          own life.  So I wanted something for
          myself.  Something that maybe didn't
          make any sense.  You know what I
          mean?

Tyler's smile has faded during this.  He's managed to
touch her, break through the tough-waitress act.  Now
she's looking him right in the eye.

                         UTAH
          I came out here from Ohio a month
          ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I
          didn't think it would effect me so
          much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or
          something.  I want to do what you
          do.  It's the truth.

                         TYLER
          Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a
          minute late I'm gone.
                  (he's grinning)
          And Stud... I didn't take you to
          raise.  I can show you a few things
          but after that you're on your own.
          That'll be four fifty.

He plunks down a ten and backs out the door, grinning.

                         UTAH
          Keep the change, Teach.

UTAH & TYLER walk across the sand.
Tyler drops her board.

                         TYLER
          Stop here.
                  (she turns to him)
          Do you agree to do exactly what I
          say when I say it?

                         UTAH
          Sure.

                                            CUT TO:

UTAH pops INTO FRAME, arms extended, one leg in front of
the other, torso bent at the waist: classic surfing
stance.
Suddenly, he drops OUT OF FRAME.

WE PULL BACK -- Revealing Utah on his board, on the sand.

                         TYLER
          Do it again.

Tyler is making him "pop" up to his feet.  Again and
again.  GAWKERS stop to watch.  Utah fights humiliation.
He pops again.  And again.  Quick cuts.
On the next pop we--

PULL BACK to reveal Utah on his board, in a wave.  He is
surfing.
For about three seconds.  He flies off the deck, ass over
teakettle.
On the SPLASH we start--

A SEQUENCE OF TIME CUTS

Tyler and Utah straddle their boards outside the break.
She nods as the set comes, mellow right tubes.  Utah digs
in, arms pumping.
He feels the bite as the wave picks up his board and
starts down the wall.
And endos.

CLOUDY PLATINUM DAWN...
Tyler shouting at Utah as he fights for balance.
He flies off again.

BLINDING BRIGHT SUNRISE.  TYLER NEXT TO UTAH in the
lineup, straddling boards.  She moves her hands like a
fighter pilot explaining a dogfight maneuver.  Utah
watches intently.

Utah, backlit in glorious slow motion, tries a little turn
and feels his feet slip out.  He slams down butt-first on
the board, flips over, feet sticking straight up out of a
blast of diamond spray.
Tyler cringes, giving a look like it's hopeless.

TYLER AND UTAH, at their cars, skinning out of their
wetsuits.  Utah looks exhausted, downcast.  She snaps her
wet towel at his ass, cheering him up.

MALIBU PIER.  RAIN.  Tyler jumps out of her Porsche and
sees Utah sitting in his car.  She goes to him, opens the
door and starts pulling him out.  Come on you pussy.

UTAH and TYLER wait their turn in the lineup.  Rain pelts
their faces.  The waves are depressing inside mushers
under a gray sky.
Utah starts to paddle.  Tyler shakes her head no.  Utah is
committed to the I'face.  Tyler stifles a laugh.

                         TYLER
                  (to the other
                   surfers)
          I'm not with him.

Johnny gouges the lip, pops and begins the drop.
Suddenly, miraculously, he catches an edge and, still
standing, is carried along the tiny wall.

The wall begins to sag.  Utah shoots along the mush
hooting and continues hooting madly as he thrashes all the
way to shore.
He turns and grins foolishly out to sea.
Tyler bursts out laughing.


EXT.  MALIBU PIER - DUSK

Big surf.  Rough conditions.  Closeout set.
UTAH, board in arm, follows Tyler out of the whitewater
onto the beach.

                         TYLER
          It's closing out completely.  Let's
          call it.

Utah nods.  His eyes track the unruly break.

                         UTAH
          Who's that?

A LONE SURFER slashing through the pilings of the pier.  A
real kamikaze run as the whitewater walls thunder behind
him.
SILHOUETTED against a crimson sky and backlit spray the
figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion
that is somehow balletic.
Laying out bottom turns, torquing his body and blasting
the lip a few times, moving so fast his long dark hair
stands straight back as if he were leaning out a car
window on the freeway.

                         TYLER (V.O.)
          That's Bodhi.  They call his the
          Bodhisattva.

Utah watches as THE BODHISATTVA gets vertical with a snap,
trims down the volcanic wall, carves the bottom, pivots,
pumps to the top, gouging the lip, getting six feet of
air.
Gawkers HOWL and shout praise at the manic surfer.

                         TYLER
          The modern savage.  Guy's even
          crazier than you, Johnny Utah.
          C'mon.

They start to walk.  The sky darkens as the sea finally
closes out completely.  The Bodhisattva seems to levitate
through the shapeless mush to shore.

                         ROACH (O.S.)
          Brah!

Suddenly a football whistles through the air above Utah's
head.
He watches as--
The Bodhisattva, board under arm, walking out of the
whitewater, makes a one-handed chest catch.

A few yards away two teams of SURFERS play football.
Utah gazes down the beach at the Bodhisattva.
Almost 30 years old, his body lean and hard as a tree
trunk.  Hardness in the face accented by long Comanche
hair.

                         BODHI
          Hey Tyler!

She whirls.  Bodhi pumps his arm.  Tyler jogs back for the
catch.  Bullseye.  She shoots Bodhi a look.  Something
crosses her face.
Bodhi smiles.  Tyler doesn't.  Then it passes.
She chucks the ball to Utah.
Who drops his board and makes the catch in one move.
He SPINS the football on his fingertip, drops it on his
foot, kicks it up into his hands.  Razzle dazzle.  He
grins evilly.


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Rimmed by a dozen car HEADLIGHTS at the edge of the sand.
Utah crouches, waiting for the snap from NATHANIEL,
ponytailed and powerfully built.  Facing them on defense
are Bodhi, Tyler and three others: ROACH, gonzo and
spiked-haired.  GROMMET... 17 and thin as a stick, and
ROSIE, a biker with piggy eyes and arms blue with tattoos.

MONTAGE STYLE -- Utah tosses a flurry of mindboggling
passes.  Every one picture perfect.  Nathaniel scrambles
z-out left, turns and the ball is practically waiting for
him.  Touchdowns galore.  Endzone dancing.  Bodhi stares
at him curiously.

Tyler rushes.  Utah enjoys scrambling, ducking left and
right, twisting her into a pretzel.  Play after play.
Utah tosses another touchdown, but Tyler keeps coming.
Sacking him.
They lie together in a heap, laughing.

Bodhi quarterbacks.  Utah rushes.  Bodhi fakes a pass then
runs, ball tucked in his arm.  Utah tears after him.  Flat
out speed run.
Roach attempts a block.  Utah hits him like a freight
train.
Roach hits the sand face first.
Grommet and Rosie the biker in a squeeze play.
Utah, fierce now, blasts between them.  No mercy.
Utah can't play for fun.  We see his expression.
Something scary there.  What we will call "juggernaut
mode".
Tyler just steps aside.

Bodhi running along wet sand as a wave sweeps up the
beach.  Looks back.  Sees a demon shooting up roostertails
of spray behind him, gaining.  Pours it on.  Both of them
pistoning through curtains of water.  Not a game anymore.
Closing on the endzone.  5 yards.  Utah is airborne.
SLAMS BODHI LIKE A SAM MISSILE.  They crash and burn
together in the surf.

The other surfers run up.  Who's this newcomer that just
centerpunched their main man?  Industrial strength
tension.

                         ROACH
          The fuck you doin' man?!  You
          fuckin' crazy?

Bodhi flashes a million dollar smile.

                         BODHI
          Chill, brah.  You know who this is?
          Johnny Utah.  Ohio State, all-
          conference.
                  (to Utah)
          Rose Bowl three years ago.  Right?

Johnny nods.  Tyler looks at him -- no shit?

                         ROACH
          Johnny fuckin' Utah!  Fuckin'-A!
          Yeah, I remember that game, man.
          You were on-fire.  They could not
          stop your ass.

                         GROMMET
          Radical!  Head-butt, dude!!

Johnny gestures "Please no".
Enthused by the concept, Grommet turns to Nathaniel.

                         GROMMET
          Head-butt!!!

They do.  Their foreheads CRACK together.  They stumble
backwards in giddy euphoria.  Nathaniel laughs like Pee
Wee Herman.

                         BODHI
          Something happened.  You got nuked
          in the last quarter.

                         UTAH
          Yeah, my knee got folded about 90
          degrees the wrong way.

                         BODHI
          And that's why you never went pro?

                         UTAH
          Two years of surgery.  I missed my
          window.  Limped through law school
          instead.

                         BODHI
          Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?
                  (like it's a disease)
          Too bad.  But at least you're
          surfing now.  So your life's not
          over yet, right?

                         UTAH
          Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - 16TH FLOOR - DAY

Utah, in shorts and T-shirt, carries his flame-job
surfboard past surveillance cameras and portraits of Bush,
Hoover and Webster.  Special Agent Cole walks by.  Eyes
the board.  Speaks deadpan.

                         COLE
          Like totally rad stick, dude.


INT.  BULLPEN

Utah tries to act casual as he carries the board to his
desk on the other side of the room.  He has to walk past
the entire gauntlet to get there.

                         SEVERAL AGENTS
          Gnarly, man... hang ten...
          cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it
          up!

Harp comes straight for him like a homing missile.

                         HARP
          How was the beach?

                         UTAH
          Fine.

                         HARP
          Surf conditions okay?

                         UTAH
          A little mushy.

                         HARP
          A little mushy!  You think the
          taxpayers would like it, Utah, if
          they knew they were paying a federal
          agent to surf and pick up girls?

                         UTAH
          Babes.

                         HARP
          What?

                         UTAH
          The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh,
          this type of undercover operation is
          entirely dependent on picking up the
          idiom of the speech.  Otherwise
          penetration is not possible, sir.
          Of the social infrastructure, I
          mean.

Harp inhales through his nose.  A bad sign.

                         HARP
          Where is Pappas?

Utah points across the room.  Harp turns.
PAPPAS, sitting behind his desk in his "Surf This" T-shirt
and pink shorts, lifts the purple Vuarnets like Tom Cruise
in Risky Business.
Looks directly at Harp.  Smiles innocently.


INT.  HARP'S OFFICE

Harp paces.  Type-A suppressed rage.
Utah and Pappas endure Harp's wrath.

                         HARP
          Special Agent Utah, this is not some
          job flippin' burgers at the drive-in.
          Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes,
          your approach to this case bothers
          me.  And yes, you bother me.  You
          two have produced squat in the last
          two weeks, during which time the Ex-
          Presidents have robbed two more
          banks!!  Do you have anything even
          remotely interesting to tell me?

                         UTAH
          Caught my first tube this morning.

Pappas signals, unseen by Harp, for Utah to shut the fuck
up.


INT.  CORRIDOR TO COMPUTER ROOM

Johnny and Angelo walking.

                         PAPPAS
          What, you couldn't have just left
          the thing in your car?

                         UTAH
          It sticks out, so I can't lock it.
          Look, Angelo, you think I joined the
          FBI to learn to surf?  This was your
          lame-o idea in the first place.  You
          gotta back me up on this.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny, all I can say is we better
          come up with something real soon.

Johnny cocks an eyebrow and opens the door to the computer
room ceremonially, like a doorman at the Ritz-Carlton.
Miss Deer looks up as they enter.


INT.  COMPUTER ROOM

TIGHT ON CRT as a lab report scrolls up the screen.  Gas
chromatography and spectroanalysis.  Columns of elements
and compounds, listed as percentage-of-sample.

                         MISS DEER (V.O.)
          Encino Savings & Loan guard grabbed
          LBJ's ponytail.  We recovered one
          hair.

WIDER, showing Utah and Pappas over her shoulder at the
terminal.

                         PAPPAS
          Yeah, yeah, I remember, last year.
          Guy got his jaw broken for it.

                         MISS DEER
          One four centimeter strand.  Color
          brown.  Oily.  Slight wave.

                         PAPPAS
          Hell, what're we waiting for, let's
          go pick the guy up.

                         UTAH
          Angelo, pay attention.  There's
          gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is
          showing traces of toxins.  PCBs.
          Heavy elements... selenium, titanium
          and arsenic.

                         PAPPAS
          Guy's the Toxic Avenger.

Utah is excited as he fits the pieces together for his
partner.

                         UTAH
          The beaches are always being closed
          because of waste spills, right?  And
          surfers are territorial.  They stick
          mostly to certain breaks.  If we can
          get some hair samples, and get a
          match to a certain beach, we'd know
          which break the Ex-Presidents surf.
          You buyin' this?

                         PAPPAS
          No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's
          gonna bug the shit out of Harp.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  LATIGO - DAY

Department of Health sign reads, "Beach Temporarily
Closed." Beyond it crashes a wasted northwest swell.

Two frustrated teenage SURFERS huddle underneath a towel.
Marijuana smoke seeps upward.
A sandaled FOOT enters frame and taps their leg.  Angry
heads poke up from beneath the towel, nostrils and mouths
billowing smoke.
The two wear T-shirts which read "Passion for Slashin" and
"Psycho Stick".
PAPPAS smiles, standing there in his beach wear, trying to
blend in.  He doesn't.

                         PAPPAS
          When you two are done makin' out, I
          need to talk to you.

                         "PSYCHO-STICK" T-SHIRT
          Hey, I ain't no butt-bouncer, dude.
          We're from the valley.  Mall babes
          'n shit.

The kids proudly high-five.

                         PAPPAS
          I just want to know if you surf here
          a lot.

                         "PASSION FOR SLASHIN'" T-SHIRT
          Shit yeah, like totally everyday
          when it's jammin'.  What is this,
          fucking narco entrapment or what,
          dude?

Pappas flashes his FBI star.  He whips out a pair of
scissors.
Brandishes them like some over-the-hill "Jason".

                         PAPPAS
          Not exactly, dudes.


EXT.  COUNTY LINE - DAY

Row of SURFMOBILES parked along a cliff, facing the ocean,
doors open, stereos blasting, SURFERS hanging, sitting on
hoods.
Utah moves along the cars, looking surfed-out.
He's tanned, relaxed.  Hair starting to bleach out.  One
of the tribe.

                         UTAH
          Whoa, brah, easy now... Don't move!
                  (Utah bends close,
                   reaching for Surf-
                   Rat's ear)
          Got some huge sucker crawling into
          your--
                  (he plucks at a tuft
                   of hair)
          Got it!  Uuuughhh.

                         SURF-RAT
          Leave some fuckin' hair, man!

Utah squashes, then inspects the mysterious creepy-crawler
hidden in his palm.  He wipes his hand on his towel, which
he keeps balled up in his other hand.

                         SURF-RAT
          What was it?

                         UTAH
          Saved your butt, bro.  Close one.

Utah shivers in disgust, then coyly turns and walks away.
The surf-rat desperately pats his ear for traces.

INT.  FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT

A long series of ENVELOPES are displayed on a desk.  Each
has the name of a Southern California beach and is
attached to a forensic printout.
HALSEY inspects each envelope.

                         HALSEY
          Naw, this isn't it.

UTAH holds up an envelope with a skinny woven ponytail
sticking out.
PAPPAS shrugs.

                         PAPPAS
          He moved.

Halsey picks up an envelope marked "Latigo Beach".

                         HALSEY
          PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic.
          The percentages look right.  Here's
          a match.

                         UTAH
          Latigo Beach.

Pappas grabs the envelope, studies it, crooks his head.

                         PAPPAS
          Surf's up, ace.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  LATIGO BEACH - DAY

EXTREME LONG LENS scans the beach from a height.  A gray,
miserable day.  Beach crowd thin except for diehards.

The image drifts across faces, BODIES.  Surfers walking
with boards.
Talking, sitting with pubescent girls.
The image settles on Johnny, astride his board, bobbing
beyond the break.

ON PAPPAS, scanning with powerful binoculars from his car.

CLOSE ON UTAH, out among the flock of hardcore surfers.
Ostensibly waiting for a wave, his eyes search the others
around him, clicking methodically from face to face.
Finally he swings his board around and awkwardly catches a
ride.
The modest wave carries him toward the beach as he
balances, tense and style-less.

He passes someone we've seen before.  The RAZORHEAD from
the first day.  In concentration, Johnny doesn't see the
guy.
But Razorhead definitely sees him.

JOHNNY reaches the beach and jogs up the sand.  He picks
up a towel and talks into it as he dries his hair.  A
glimpse of the walkie-talkie hidden beneath.

                         UTAH
          Big zippo so far.  How about you?

                         PAPPAS (RADIO)
          Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll
          be subtle, if it's here at all.

PAPPAS WATCHES as Johnny crosses toward the outside shower
next to the public restroom.
LONG LENS view of Utah passing OUT OF SIGHT behind the
building.

AT THE SHOWER Johnny sets down his gear and opens his
wetsuit to the warm, salt-free jet of water.  TRACKING
SLOWLY IN on him as he lets it pour over his face.
A HAND ENTERS FRAME, shutting off the water suddenly.

TIGHT ON UTAH, his eyes opening.

REVERSE, revealing RAZORHEAD and THREE OTHERS.
They are powerfully built SURF-NAZIS.
Scalps shaved on the sides.  Hair military short on top,
lengthening into pigtails in the back.  Tattoos.  Wrist
chains.
TONE, ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD.  The one who socked Utah
before is BUNKER.  They spread out flanking him.

                         WARCHILD
          This the guy?

                         BUNKER
          Yeah.

                         UTAH
                  (good natured)
          Okay, so this is where you tell me
          all about how locals rule and yuppie
          insects like me shouldn't be surfing
          your break and all that, right?

                         BUNKER
          No.

                         TONE
          Waste of time.

                         WARCHILD
          We're just going to fuck you up.

                         UTAH
          Oh.

As they lunge, Utah grabs his board and swings it in a
whistling roundhouse.  Its edge slams Warchild in the gut
and folds him double.  The bad news is... Warchild gets an
arm around it and brings a pile-driver hammer-punch down.
The board splits into two pieces.
Utah drops his end as the others close.  A flurry of
punches and kicks, most of which he blocks.  But he's lost
the offensive.
Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style
side-kick.

TIGHT ON Utah's towel, talking with Pappas' voice.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny?  You there?

ANGELO gets out of the car fast.  He jogs twenty feet and
raises the binoculars.  Catches a glimpse of the carnage
around the edge of the building.  Breaks into a run,
massive legs pistoning.

JOHNNY HITS THE GROUND hard.  He rolls and comes up fast.
The razorhead brothers are a little surprised.

                         ARCHBOLD
          The dude can fight!

Warchild grabs Utah from behind.  Gets him in a headlock.
Archbold and Tone pin his arms.  Bunker starts working him
like a practice bag.  At this moment, Johnny is getting
the proverbial shit beat out of him.
SUDDENLY, a new figure blurs INTO FRAME.

BODHI seizes Bunker and flings him aside.  He spins with
remarkable agility and drives his heel into Warchild's
face.
Utah breaks free, staggering back on the sand.  The fight
is still there in his eyes.

Bodhi is at his side -- holding the others at bay with a
raised hand and an evil look.

                         BODHI
          Back off!  Now!!  Just let it go!

                         BUNKER
          Stay outta this, Bodhi!

                         BODHI
          He's with me.  Now back off.
          Seriously.Just do it!
                  (they relax slightly)
          You alright Warchild?

                         WARCHILD
                  (holding his bleeding
                   nose)
          Fuck you.

Everybody has backed off a bit, panting.
Utah steps toward Bunker.  Like he's maybe going to shake
hands.

                         UTAH
          What's your name?

                         BUNKER
          Bunker.

                         UTAH
          Well, listen, Bunker... I'm actually
          kinda glad you found me.

                         BUNKER
          Yeah?  Why?

Johnny answers with a LIGHTNING ROUNDHOUSE that hits with
a CRACK!  They can hear it in Pomona.
BUNKER HITS THE GROUND.  Flat out.  Lights out.
Tone, Archbold and Warchild lunge like dogs.
Bodhi yanks Utah out of the line of fire.

                         BODHI
          Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold it, ladies.  Give
          it a rest.
                  (to Utah)
          Let's go.

He literally turns Utah around.
They begin to walk, stepping over the pieces of Johnny's
board.

                         BODHI
                  (under his breath)
          Do me a favor, Johnny, just keep
          walking.

Tone starts to go after them.  Archbold grabs his arm.
They help Bunker up.  Warchild holds he bleeding nose.
Utah and Bodhi start up the stairs, turn a corner and run
HEAD-ON into a huffing PAPPAS.
The big man clocks a battered but intact Utah.
We see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a
second.

                         PAPPAS
                  (out of breath)
          Uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10,
          12, running with a car stereo?
          Stole the fucking CD too, you
          believe it?

Utah is grateful for the cover.

                         UTAH
          No, but there are four guys back
          there you might check out.

                         PAPPAS
          Thanks, buddy.

He shoves on.


EXT.  PARKING LOT

Bodhi and Utah weave among the cars and motorcycles,
beach-types coming and going.

                         UTAH
          Friends of yours, huh?

                         BODHI
          The one you decked is Bunker Wiess.
          The big one is his brother,
          Warchild.  The other two always
          hang.  They think they're some kinda
          death squad around here.

                         UTAH
          What's their program?

                         BODHI
          They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains
          are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing
          because they give nothing back, and
          they have no respect for the sea.
          They just want to get radical.  It's
          mindless aggression.  They'll never
          get it, the spiritual side of it.

                         UTAH
          You always talk like this?  You're
          not gonna start chanting or anything
          are you?

                         BODHI
                  (laughing)
          No.
                  (beat)
          So I was up the beach.  I saw it
          going down.  you didn't hesitate...
          they never backed you up an inch.
          That's rare in this world.

                         UTAH
          Thanks for stepping in.

                         BODHI
          De nada.

Bodhi keeps on walking as Utah reaches his car and stops.
Five paces on, he stops and turns back.  A moment of
decision...

                         UTAH
          Gonna be some people at my house
          tonight.  Maybe you can make it.

                         UTAH
          Where?

                         BODHI
          Come with Tyler.  She knows.

Bodhi turns and saunters away.  Utah considers his last
words, wondering how well Tyler and Bodhi know each other.

INT./ EXT.  CAR - PCH - SANTA MONICA - DAY

Utah is struggling into a T-shirt as Pappas drives,
intently following a beat-to-shit JEEP.  Paramilitary
olive-drab and full of surfboards.  And razorhead.

                         PAPPAS
          Ten seconds you're out of sight.
          Unbelievable.

Johnny is equipment-juggling now... cradling a cellular
phone at his ear while steadying Pappas' binoculars in
front of his eyes.

                         UTAH
          You're losin' them.
                  (into phone)
          That's right.  Two-denver-four-sam-
          niner-five-niner.  Late seventies
          Jeep.

LONG LENS, JOHNNY'S POV through binoculars.  Bunker's jeep
weaves aggressively through traffic ahead.  Horns honk.
Tone flips off the driver of a Toyota.

                         PAPPAS
          Look, if you're gonna go leavin'
          your piece and your shield in the
          car, you can damn well stay in
          sight.  Okay?

                         UTAH
          Okay, Dad.


EXT.  VENICE STREET - DAY

Low rent street off Washington.
EXTREME LONG LENS on Jeep as it pulls onto the dead front
lawn of a brown stucco house with bars on the windows.
The razorheads get out, pulling boards and wetsuits from
the Jeep.  They are dressed now in ripped jeans, GI boots,
sleeveless Megadeth T-shirts, etc.
Watching, we become aware that two of them have brown hair
in a radical style... shaved sides and a short ponytail.

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          The jeep is registered to a Bradley
          Wiess.  My buddy.  Guy's got quite a
          sheet.
                  (into phone)
          Yeah, yeah... skip all that.  Gimme
          the greatest hits.  Misdemeanor
          possession of cocaine.  That's
          good...


INT./ EXT.  CAR

Utah on the cellular, Pappas behind the wheel as they
slide to a stop half a block from the stucco house.

                         UTAH
          ... Felony B and E, three months in
          juvey.  Better.  Felony assault.
          Postgraduate work at Chino.
          Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What
          about the brother?
                  (Utah is grinning)
          Great!  Another model citizen.
          These guys really fit the profile.

                         PAPPAS
          Remember, all bank robbers are
          losers, but not all losers are bank
          robbers.

LONG LENS POV of Razorheads house.  Through the windows we
see the four moving inside.  Tone throws Archbold and
Bunker a Coors from the fridge.  Archbold shakes his and
opens it in Warchild's face.  Warchild, in no mood, slams
him against the wall.  We feel the revved-up, chaotic
energy of the group in silent pantomime.

Bunker is met by a GIRL coming from the back of the house.
She is wearing only panties and a black leather vest.
Short black hair and tattoos stark on her white skin.
Bunker puts one arm around her neck in a head lock embrace
and slides his other hand under her vest.  Tone pulls the
curtains.

                         UTAH
          These are the guys.  I can feel it.
          I say we lay it on Harp.

EXT.  STREET NEAR HOUSE - NIGHT

TELEPHOTO VIEW of house.
Bunker and Archbold have partially disassembled the engine
of a Kawasaki 1100 parked in the living room.  They are
drinking beer and arguing about the carburetors, lit by
the blue glow of the TV.  Warchild is watching a living-
dead movie on tape.
He replays the gory parts.  Not a happening night at the
Razorheads.

REVERSE, as binoculars are lowered, revealing Cole.
WIDER, to show the dynamic team of Cole and Munoz
glowering in a plain sedan, Utah leaning in the side
window.

                         MUNOZ
          This is bullshit.  This is a
          bullshit lead.  This is totally
          bullshit.  Harp must be fucking
          desperate if he's listening to you
          two flakes.

                         UTAH
          See you bright and early, guys.

Pappas walks up with a grease-stained box.  Jams it
through the window.

                         PAPPAS
          Cold pizza?  It's great for
          breakfast.


INT./ EXT.  PAPPAS' CAR - NIGHT

Pappas pulls away from the curb, roaring past the other
agents sedan.  Utah and Cole flip each other off
perfunctorily as they pass.

                         UTAH
          When did Harp say they'd have the
          warrant?

                         PAPPAS
          He's pushing it through first thing.
          You better get some sleep tonight,
          it could be an interesting morning.

EXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A bunker-like structure built of stone and glass on a
cliff overlooking the Pacific.  Surfmobiles and
motorcycles parked in front.  A strong backbeat thumps
through the open front doors.
Tyler's Porsche pulls into the driveway.  She and Johnny
get out and head for the entrance.

                         UTAH
          Nice place.

                         TYLER
          He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi
          always gets some slick place and
          throws it open to every surf burnout
          around.  Most a these guys can't
          keep a job.  When the swell comes,
          they're gone, they have to ride.


INT./ EXT.  BODHI'S HOUSE

Tyler leads Utah through the steady flow of SURF-RATS and
other PCH NOMADS toward a large outdoor deck where a
barbecue is in progress.  Moonlit waves pound the shore
eighty feet below.

They are immediately distracted by the small crowd
gathering around GROMMET who has his nose pressed flat
against the center of a dart board.
His eyes swivels back to ROACH, standing fifteen feet
away, dart in hand, getting ready to throw.

                         GROMMET
          Do your worst, man!

Roach drains a beer in one gulp, spies the sharp needle
point of the dart, then squints at the target.
ROSIE moves through the small crowd collecting bets.

Suddenly Roaches arm snaps back.  A collective hush...
In a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is
airborne.

TWAAAPPPPPP!  Bulls-eye.  Centimeters from flesh.  Grommet
secretly exhales.  Roach howls as Rosie rains money on his
head.
The crowd goes wild.
BODHI stands nearby with his arm around a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
Pleased to see Utah, he motions him over.

                         UTAH
          Don't you gamble?

                         BODHI
          Only make bets I can't afford to
          lose.  Only way to be 100%
          committed.

With that, Bodhi smiles, then he and the woman vanish into
the crowd.  Utah watches them go, turns to Tyler.

                         UTAH
          Who's the girl?

                         TYLER
          Catch of the day.

                         UTAH
          Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.

                         TYLER
          People are expendable to Bodhi.

                         UTAH
          Meaning you were expendable.

                         TYLER
                  (shrugs)
          We went out for about five
          minutes... which is four minutes
          longer than most of them.  But you
          can't hold it against him, he's...
          different.

                         UTAH
          Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".

                         TYLER
                  (she chuckles)
          Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a
          higher plane of existence, or
          something.
                  (thoughtful)
          Maybe he has.  You've seen him
          surf... that frenzy.  It seems like
          anger.  It's not.  It's the energy
          of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman
          in his life.  She's his only true
          lover.

Utah studies her a moment.  He's caught the faintest hint
of regret in her voice.  But also the straight-ahead
pragmatism.  He looks down at the waves pounding
mercilessly against the rocks.

                         UTAH
          All she does is beat the shit out of
          me.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

PARTY - LATER

Lingering surf-rats stoned and drunk.
Nathaniel stands on the railing of the deck, Corona in
hand, gazing out at the black water.  He grins sloppily,
body wavering dangerously as he hunkers down into a
surfing stance.

                         NATHANIEL
                  (beer soaked speech)
          ... Okay, so you're in the face,
          it's twenty-five feet straight down,
          your balls are about this big.
                  (like he's holding up
                   two BB's)
          And the whole thing's moving, right,
          roaring like you're stuck to the
          front of a freight train.  There
          ain't nothin' like it, man.  The
          ultimate rush.  Forget about sex, it
          doesn't even come close.

                         ROACH
          You lose it right then, you're
          history.  The fish'll be pickin' you
          outta the coral.

Nathaniel cackles that absurd Pee-Wee Herman laugh.  He
starts to flail, arms pinwheeling.
Utah catches him by the back of the shorts and pulls him
back.  Nathaniel spins and drops clumsily onto the deck.

                         NATHANIEL
                  (matter of factly)
          Thanks, brah.

Tyler sits next to Johnny, sipping a beer.  Bodhi is not
in sight.

                         ROACH
          See, it's all dynamic, it's all in
          motion.  You can't just stop and
          walk on in to the beach if you don't
          like the way things are going, y'
          know what I mean?  You gotta ride it
          out man, all the way.

                         GROMMET
          You ride the monsters, you gotta
          know you're ridin' a line between
          life and death.  There ain't no
          forgiveness.

                         UTAH
          So what's the biggest?  Waimea?

                         BODHI (V.O.)
          No, Bells Beach, Australia.

Bodhi glides into the group and sits, his expression dark
and enigmatic.  The beautiful girl kneels behind him,
massaging his neck.  He seems not to notice.

                         GROMMET
          Shit, yeah!  I remember that day...
          gnarly fuckin' ass!  Was your
          birthday--

                         ROACH
          The set was northwest.  Jacking up
          like a fucking mountain of gray
          glass--

                         BODHI
          I made that one mistake you pray
          you'll never make--

                         NATHANIEL
          You shoulda fuckin' seen it... it
          was like he fell for-ever.  Then the
          curl crashes down and he's gooone--

                         GROMMET
          -- held down in the washing machine,
          man... it was severe, we couldn't
          see nothin' thought it was all over
          for sure--

Nathaniel HOWLS.
Tyler watches Utah watching Bodhi.  Notices how he is
mesmerized by these war stories.  Bodhi smiles,
unexpectedly.

                         BODHI
          Not tragic to die doing what you
          love.  You want the ultimate thrill,
          you gotta be willing to pay the
          ultimate price.

                         NATHANIEL
          Fuckin' A.

                         GROMMET
                  (draining a Corona)
          Hell, I ain't gonna see 30.

He and Nathaniel slap a warm, brotherly handshake.
Utah notices that Tyler is giving him a dark look.
She gets up suddenly and walks away from the group.

                         UTAH
                  (to the surfers,
                   covering)
          Uh.  I need another beer.

He heads out after Tyler.


INT.  HALLWAY - DEN

Johnny moves through the house, looking for her.  As he
passes the den, he sees Tyler standing inside, and goes
into the dark room.
It is the only personalized space we have seen in the
house.
A kind of shrine to the Bodhisattva.
Shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels.
Maori masks, a blowgun, a skeletal shark mouth two feet
across, a huge fossil ammonite... an unbelievable variety
of tribal artifacts and marine specimens.
The books include political literature, eastern religion,
philosophy.  A strange hodgepodge of titles and authors:
Nietzsche, Marx, the Tao, "Steal this Book", "The Book of
Five Rings", Frederick Forsyth thrillers.

Tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and Johnny walks
up behind her.  Shots of Bodhi surfing a monster wave,
mountain-biking, skydiving, flying an ultralight airplane,
bungee-cord jumping, cliff diving.
Every kamikaze activity in the book.

                         TYLER
          Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.
          I hope you're not buying into this
          banzai-bullshit like the rest of
          Bodhi's moonies.

                         UTAH
          What are you talking about?

                         TYLER
          I've seen that kamikaze look,
          Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi
          can smell it a mile away.  He'll
          take you to the edge... and past it.
                  (she looks past
                   Johnny, sees
                   something)
          Hey, Bodhi.

Utah turns.  Bodhi is in the doorway.

                         BODHI
          Johnny has his own demons, don't
          you, Johnny?

Bodhi seems to stare into him.
Utah breaks the look.  Turns back to the photo gallery.
Bodhi's eyes swivel.  He ponders something.  Looks at
Tyler.

                         BODHI
          Feel it?

Roach and some of the other surfers appear in the hallway,
wondering what happened to their leader.  He turns to
them.

                         BODHI
          Gentlemen, it's time.

HOOT AND CHEERS.  Everyone bursts into motion.  Yelling
and running through the house.

                         UTAH
          What's goin' on?

                         TYLER
          Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always
          knows.

Bodhi returns from another room with... AN ALL-BLACK
SURFBOARD.  It gleams like obsidian.  Near the tip, in
small gray letters it says "Stealth Fighter".  Bodhi
thrusts it into Johnny's hands.
The others WHOOP maniacally.
Johnny feels the challenge.  The pull of the tribe.

                         BODHI
          Let's go, Utah.  Time for a little
          stealth mission.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  LATIGO BEACH - NIGHT

SIX DARK FIGURES walk toward us out of shafts of light...
the headlights of Bodhi's CHEVY 4WD and Tyler's Porsche.
The figures are Bodhi, Johnny, Tyler and the other
surfers.
ROSIE hangs back with the idling vehicles, tattooed arms
crossed.  He puffs on a cigarette.

A WIDE SHOT (MATTE) of the beach shows a pool of light
from the headlights, beyond it a vast silver ocean under a
black sky.  The full moon casts the world in cold
monochrome.  The little figures reach the sea.

                         ROACH
                  (a voice in the
                   distance)
          Gaping barrels!  Way overhead, man!

CLOSER, as moonlit figures run into the water.
Utah stands on the beach, hoping his eyes will adjust.

                         UTAH
          I can barely do this in broad
          daylight.

                         TYLER
          Come on.  At least no one's gonna
          see how bad you are.

Johnny clenches his jaw and charges past her into the
water.
He strokes powerfully out through the black swell.

UTAH'S EBONY BOARD pierces the wave and he slides down the
backside to where the others are waiting.  Roach and
Nathaniel, silhouettes nearby, see one they like and take
off yelling.
Johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him.

                         UTAH
          I gotta be fucking crazy.

                         BODHI
          Yeah, but are you crazy enough?

Grommet gets a ride, slicing across in front of them.
A ghost moving off into the silvery distance.
Tyler waves jauntily and takes the next one.  It's
Johnny's turn.

                         BODHI
          Football's a man-made game.  You
          keep score with numbers.  But in
          this, there's no field, no rules, no
          opponent.  Just you and the wave.

                         UTAH
          I know that part.  Tell me something
          I can use, here.

                         BODHI
          I've watched you once or twice.  You
          surf like it's some kind of street
          fight.  You jerk along from moment
          to moment, fighting everything that
          comes at you.  Always trying to win.

                         UTAH
          A flaw I'm working on.

                         BODHI
          The only way to win out here is to
          surrender.  You have to feel what
          the wave is doing, accept its
          energy, get in sync.  Just feel it
          all moving in the blackness... you
          don't need to see.

                         UTAH
          Yeah, right, vision is highly over-
          rated.

Bodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline.
Without looking back, he senses the incoming swell.

                         BODHI
          This one's got your name on it,
          Johnny.

Utah looks.  Huge glassy face, perfectly formed.  Black
and terrifying.

                         BODHI
          Let's go.

Bodhi digs in with both hands, driving himself forward.
Johnny starts grabbing water right behind him.  The wave
picks them up.

                         UTAH
          Shit, I'm gonna die.  I'm gonna die
          now.

Johnny uses the patented Tyler-pop and makes it to his
feet.  Suddenly he's going like a shot.
He moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down.
Maintains a fragile control.
On pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in
behind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black
face.

Bodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the
moonlight.
Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little
forward on the board.  The nose dips, picking up speed.

Johnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning
that he can make long floating turns up and down the
glassy face.

Feeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling
up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a
little of it.

The Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the
night.
Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face.
Bodhi looks back.  Gives him a thumbs up.
Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom,
slashing back and climbing.
Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the
speed.
He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling.
The grin dropping off his face.

He falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over them
like a great black wing.

TYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her.
Utah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonzo
wolf as they go by.
She grins to herself, watching him.
Knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for
life.


EXT.  BEACH PARKING LOT

Rosie sits on the sand next to a blazing fire in a cement
firepit.

ANGLE THROUGH THE HEAT HAZE above the flames.  Tyler
punches through, a few feet away.  She paddles toward him,
coming alongside.

                         TYLER
          You had enough?

                         UTAH
          Yeah.  I just want to sit out here
          for a minute.

He watches the lights along the shoreline as the gentle
swell between sets lifts and drops them.  His face is
somehow childlike.
A slow grin spreads itself across his face.

                         TYLER
          Look at you.

                         UTAH
          What?

                         TYLER
          Well, usually you have this sort of
          intense scowl of concentration, like
          you're doing this for a school
          project or something... I don't
          know, like something's driving you.
                  (she puts her
                   fingertip to  his
                   forehead)
          See, it's gone.  If I didn't know
          better I'd say you looked almost
          happy.

                         UTAH
          I... I don't know.  I can't describe
          what I'm feeling.

                         TYLER
                  (smiling)
          You don't have to.

Her face seems luminous in the moonlight.  The ocean
silver.  The shore a shimmering line of gold.  The sky
black velvet.

Utah turns to Tyler, eyes exploring her, as in a dream.
Water beads on her dark skin like crawling diamonds.
He glides closer, holding her board like an uneasy horse
alongside his.
He runs his fingertips down her arm.

                         UTAH
          Goosebumps.  Come here.

She leans closer and he rubs his hands up and down her
arms, warming her.  His hands stop on her shoulders.
He pulls her to his mouth.  Her tongue meets his.
She wants this.
He is surprised by the fierceness of her kiss, which
overwhelms his.

TIGHT ON THE ZIPPER of her shorty wetsuit as Johnny's
fingers draw it down.  Slowly down, to where it ends
between her legs.
He spreads the front and slips his hands inside, along her
ribs.

                         TYLER
          Those are cold.

                         UTAH
          Warm them up.

She moves his strong hand onto her breast.
His fingers massage her cold-stiffened nipple.
She moans and grabs his wet hair in her other hand,
pulling him into another intense kiss.


EXT.  OCEAN - UNDERWATER

Looking up from the bottom,  we see the silhouettes of two
boards surrounded by pulsing shafts of moonlight.
CAMERA TILTS DOWN to show the bottom.
The dreamlike blue light shimmering on the sand and rocks.
A big shark browses gracefully, ignoring the lovers.
Their moment of harmony with the sea will be honored.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

Tyler's Porsche stands alone in an empty lot.
Her surfboard sticks up in back, next to Utah's "stealth
fighter".
Rosie's fire is burning low.
Tyler, half-wrapped in a blanket from the car, straddles
Johnny on the sand like she straddles her board.  The
blanket slips down.
Naked silhouettes in the firelight.
She arches her back as they move together in prefect sync.
Grips his shoulders and stares into his face, her teeth
bared in a grimace of pleasure that looks like pain.
She makes love like she does everything... with honesty
and intensity.
Utah, surprisingly, is gentle and slow.
He strokes her hair after she collapses onto him.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  BEACH - DAWN

ECU JOHNNY as he cracks one eye open, registering the dawn
light.
He bolts up, looking around.  Tyler is asleep beside him,
with the quilt from the car pulled up tight to her chin.
She looks radiant in sleep.
He grabs his watch out of the sand and looks at it.

                         UTAH
          Holy shit.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND RAZORHEAD HOUSE

LONG LENS on UTAH'S SEDAN fishtailing through the alley,
narrowly missing dumpsters and parked cars.
He pulls up next to several unmarked FBI sedans.  No one
in sight.

UTAH jumps out tucking in yesterday's shirt, stuffing his
Beretta into his waistband.  He also shoves a small
leather case into his belt.

Utah pulls open the door to one of the unmarked cars and
rips a walkie-talkie out of the charging rack on the front
seat.
Running, he passes a gate.  Goes back.  Looks.

HIS POV -- FOUR MEN huddled behind a garage.  COLE, MUNOZ,
AND TWO OTHER AGENTS.  All with guns and walkie-talkies.

                         UTAH
                  (whispering)
          You guys need any help?

                         COLE
                  (not amused)
          You're late.

We hear Pappas' voice over the radio.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          Did that worthless punk partner of
          mine ever show up?

                         UTAH
                  (grinning)
          Right here, partner.


EXT.  STREET - NEARBY

Pappas has his shirt hiked up as another agent, BABBIT,
tapes a microphone transmitter to his stomach.  Pappas
talks into his top button.

                         PAPPAS
          Good of you to join us, hotshot.
                  (to Babbit)
          Watch it.  I told you, not on the
          hairs, goddammit.

Babbit moves the transmitter, putting the tape on
differently.

                         UTAH
          I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where
          you want me?

                         PAPPAS
          Cole and Munoz are going in the back
          door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I
          want you at the side window by the
          hedge.  You're strictly backup, got
          it?

                         UTAH
          Got it.

                         PAPPAS
          Awright.  Get into position.  I'm
          rolling.

Pappas pulls the loose Hawaiian shirt down over the radio-
mike gear and his stalwart .38 snub.
He steps out from behind a fence and walks along the
sidewalk toward Bunker's house, two doors down.  He is
wearing polyester shorts and sandals, and carrying a DOG
LEASH.

                         PAPPAS
          Here Scooby!  Where are you boy?
          Here Scooby!!  You furball piece of
          shit.

COLE AND MUNOZ snap around the corner of the garage and
sprint low toward the rear of the brown stucco house.

UTAH circles back out through the alley.  TRACKING WITH
HIM as he makes it to the neighbor's back hedge and crab-
walks toward Bunker's house.  BABBIT and ANOTHER AGENT
make it to the front corner of the stucco house, staying
out of sight of the windows.

ANGELO is walking up to the falling-down porch of this
low-rent roach-hotel.

JOHNNY is elbow-crawling between the house and a tall
hedge.
He slides quietly in below a bedroom window.
He pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his
waistband.  Removes something from it.  A DENTAL MIRROR.
Moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling
it where he can see inside.

TIGHT ON DENTAL MIRROR, Johnny's POV.
We see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind.
Tone is lying on the bed, wearing headphones.  Cranked up
speedmetal.
His eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat
like karate on 40,000 volts.
The door to a bathroom is open, and the black-haired girl
can be made out behind rippled shower glass.

TIGHT ON DOORBELL as Pappas rings it.

UTAH JUMPS at an explosion of sound.  He spins in a
microsecond, pistol aimed at... A LAWN MOWER.
Through the hedge we can just see THE NEIGHBOR, sixtyish
and polyester clad, as he adjusts the choke on the roaring
machine about two feet from Johnny's face.  Utah exhales
and lowers the gun.  Wipes sweat from his eyes.

TIGHT ON PAPPAS, smiling open-faced and goofily charming
as...

THE DOOR opens, revealing a GIRL we haven't seen before.
She has hair like bleached fiberglass, black eye-makeup
and nails.  Ramones-style wardrobe.  She looks tense, and
won't open the door very far.

                         FIBERGLASS
          Yeah?  What?

                         PAPPAS
          Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of
          a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About
          this big.

                         FIBERGLASS
          No.

UTAH blinks at what he sees.

HIS POV, in the little mirror.
Like a silent pantomime under the ROAR OF THE MOWER, he
sees Bunker and Warchild come flying into the room.
They are hyper and manic.  Eyes wild.
Bunker leaps clear over the bed.
Grabs a COMBAT SHOTGUN from the closet.  Throws it to
Warchild.  Tone is oblivious.
Bunker thumps him in the chest and Tone leaps up like an
overwound toy, gaping "What the fuck?!" we read his lips
saying.
Bunker grabs a STEYR ASSAULT RIFLE, white knuckled, while
Tone fumbles around and comes up with a .45 COLT AUTO.

                         UTAH
                  (into his headset)
          Babbit.  Get Angelo out of there.
          They're pulling out a fucking
          arsenal!  Babbit, you copy?  Cole?
          Don't let him pull his badge!


EXT.  BACK YARD

Cole and Munoz push their earpieces in deeper.  Scowl.

                         MUNOZ
          Utah, say again.  What?
                  (to Cole)
          I can't hear jack shit over this
          lawnmower.  Christ.


INT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE

In the bedroom, Bunker looks through a slit of door at
Fiberglass.  We hear Pappas just outside.

                         PAPPAS (V.O.)
          ... and the guy next door said he
          saw it go into your backyard.  My
          wife'll kill me if I lose the little
          bastard.  Me, I could care less.
          Whole house smells from it's liftin'
          its leg all the time...

Bunker looks like he's on paranoia overdrive.

                         BUNKER
          Something's goin' down, man.  This
          ain't right.

                         TONE
                  (freaked)
          No, man, it's nothin'.  It's
          nothin'.

                         BUNKER
          Will you shut the fuck up!  Check
          the windows.  Do it!!


EXT.  RAZORHEAD'S HOUSE

Utah sucks up against the wall as Warchild looks furtively
out the window.  We see them both, but Warchild doesn't
see Johnny, plastered right below him.
Johnny closes his eyes and grits his teeth.  Shiiiiittt!

PAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, is bobbing his head, trying to
look inside.

                         PAPPAS
          You sure he isn't out back?  You
          mind if I go take a look?

                         FIBERGLASS
          Look, I don't know anything about
          your dog, okay--

                         PAPPAS
          Well is there anyone else here that
          might have seen him?

                         FIBERGLASS
          There's nobody else here...


INT.  HOUSE

Warchild slams into the wall next to Bunker.

                         WARCHILD
          There's two guys by the back door.
          Ducked down.

                         TONE
          Oh, shit.  Shit!!  We're fucked,
          man.

                         BUNKER
          That fat fuck comes through the door
          I'm gonna pump him up.  Swear to
          Christ, man, I'm gonna blow the dude
          up!

Scared and vicious, like a cornered dog.  We believe him.
Bunker jacks the bolt on the Steyr.  Warchild cocks the
shotgun.


EXT.  HOUSE

JOHNNY is pissing himself.  He can see it all going down.
So fast he doesn't have time to think.
He goes into motion -- slipping rapidly along the wall to
the next window.
The bathroom window.

PAPPAS, AT THE FRONT DOOR, makes his move.
He pushes the door open, breaking the security chain, and
jams his FBI shield in the girl's face as he grabs her
arm.

                         PAPPAS
          FBI, gorgeous.  Now let's take a
          look around--


INT.  HOUSE

Bunker's eyes bug out as he sees Pappas coming through the
door.  He snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder.
Suddenly Johnny is behind him -- half-in the bathroom
window, pistol gripped double-handed like they taught him
in Quantico.

                         UTAH
          FBI!!  DROP IT!

Bunker whips around.  Squeezing off a wild burst!  B-B-B-
BLAM!
It rips the plaster next to Johnny's shoulder.
Shatters the shower door behind him.  The BLACK-HAIRED
GIRL screams.
Johnny flinches, FIRING RAPIDLY.  Wild.
Bunker drops, hit.
Warchild lets go with the 12 gauge.  KABOOM!
Takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by
Johnny's head.
Deafening in the confined space.
Johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe.
Tone just splits.  Down the hall like a greyhound.

PAPPAS is on one knee, his piece drawn fast, holding
Fiberglass in a neck-lock with one massive arm.
Bunker, wild-eyed and bleeding, is on his knees in the
bathroom doorway.
He raises the Steyr.  Mistake.

Angelo FIRES.  30 years in the field tends to show.
Three rounds.  Chest.  Chest.  Head.
Bunker is off the planet.

MUNOZ KICKS THE BACKDOOR IN like they do in the movies.
He and Cole charge into the rancid kitchen.  Badass FBI
agents.

JOHNNY, hotwired and hyperventilating, pops out for a shot
around the doorframe.  He gets a glimpse of Warchild's
back disappearing into the hallway.  FIRES.  His shot is
wasted, punching plaster.

Suddenly a pink freight-train hits him.
He forgot about the girl in the shower.
Naked except for her tattoos, she bodyslams him face-first
into the wall.
As he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and
hammers his head into the medicine-cabinet -- CRASH --
shattering the mirror.
Then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the
wall into her.
She drives her elbow into his back as he drops.
"FREIGHT TRAIN" lands knee-first on his gun hand, and
viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot.  It
skitters under the bed.

She's cut up from flying glass.  Demon-eyed and wired, her
body lithe and muscular under white skin.  She sprints
across the bedroom, leaving Utah slumped, heaving for
breath.

IN THE HALLWAY, Tone is hidden behind a doorway.
White-knuckling the forty-five.  A wild-eyed kid with a
big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it.
He hears footsteps POUNDING behind him and spins.
It's Warchild, running with the shot-gun.

                         WARCHILD
          Move it, man.  Let's get the fuck
          out of here!

Off-guard, Tone is SLAMMED BY THE DOOR as Munoz drives
into it with his shoulder.
Pounded between the door and wall, Tone is wired so tight
he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own
right foot.
He screams and drops to the floor.
Munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on
Warchild, who dives into a doorway.
Cole drives past Munoz, who has Tone pinned, and pounds
down the corridor.

Cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on
Warchild.
"Freight-train" appears behind him from another door.
She raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his
back up to the hilt.
Pulls them out, going for another stab, when--
Pappas spins her around and slams her face-first into the
wall.

UTAH, in the bedroom, sees Warchild blur across his field
of vision.
On pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive.  Johnny leaps
the bed and goes ballistic.  His flying tackle catches
Warchild at the window.


EXT.  HOUSE

The window EXPLODES OUTWARD in a spray of sunlit glass.
Utah and Warchild crash to the ground.
The razorhead, with 50 pounds on Johnny, rises like a
bull.
Bleeding from superficial lacerations, Warchild plows
through the hedge.
Johnny dives after him.
The Polyester Neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed
figures careen toward him.  He is knocked flying, and the
ROARING LAWNMOWER is flipped onto its side.

Utah and Warchild are locked together.
The shotgun lies nearby, out of play.
Warchild jerks a 6 INCH KNIFE free from its sheath,
hanging from a thong around his neck.  He trusts straight
at Johnny's throat.
Johnny deflects the thrust -- INTO THE WHIRLING LAWNMOWER.
KA-WHANGGG!!!  The knife is hammered out of Warchild's
hand.
Whistles away, spinning.

Warchild grabs Johnny as they scramble, and heaves him
bodily toward the spinning blade.  Utah catches the rim of
the mower with both hands, stopping himself inches from
the rotor.
Warchild puts all his weight on Johnny.
Pushing him face-first toward the blades.
Johnny feels the wind on his face.
The engine is roaring, full throttle.

PAPPAS APPEARS BEHIND THEM.
He aims the .38.  FIRES TWICE.
The little Briggs & Stratton dies young, its casing
shattered.
The rotor spins to a stop.
Warchild looks up into the black eye of Pappas' gun.
Two inched from his face.

                         PAPPAS
          Speak into the microphone.

The razorhead sags, the fight going out of him.
Babbit kicks him off Johnny, face down onto the lawn.
Cuffs him.


INT.  BATHROOM - BEDROOM - LATER

UTAH dry heaves over the sink.  Turns the faucet on full
blast and hoses his head.  He lifts a dripping face, wipes
water out of his eyes, stops on the reflection in the
mirror.  Pappas is there.

                         PAPPAS
          It's always been lasers and paper
          targets until today, right?

Utah looks up at him and nods.  He glances through the
doorway at Bunker, dead in a pool of blood.  Tone is
wailing as paramedics work on his foot.  Cole is being
taken out on a stretcher.

                         PAPPAS
          No difference, Utah.  Just a little
          more to clean up.
                  (squeezes the
                   rookie's  shoulder)
          It's alright.  You did good today.

Across the bedroom AGENT BABBIT rips the back off a big
speaker unit.  Behind it, taped to the woofer, are two
large packets of a white substance.

                         PAPPAS
          Oh shit.

Utah stares at the dope.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  POLICE HQ - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT ON WARCHILD manacled to the chair screaming his head
off.  We cannot hear him through the glass.  It looks like
pantomime.

UTAH and PAPPAS watch through the one way observation
window.
THWAAAAAP!!  The two taped packets slam the wall inches
from Utah's right ear.  Johnny snaps his head around.
Stares into the face of DIETZ who looks like Warchild's
meaner brother.
And he's pissed as hell...

                         DIETZ
          You know what this is?!  Two keys
          uncut crystal meth!

                         UTAH
          What the hell's your problem?

Dietz manically grabs a clump of his stringy hair.

                         DIETZ
          You think I like this haircut?  My
          wife wants me to stay at Ramada -- I
          been working on these guys for THREE
          MONTHS!  Finally -- finally--
                  (nodding to Warchild)
          -- I get dickwad in there wantin' to
          play wheel of fortune so I can find
          out their supplier!

HARP emerges from the interrogation room, we hear a sliver
of Warchild's battle cry.  He spies Utah.

                         HARP
          This is agent Dietz, DEA.  He's got
          a record of your suspect's movements
          every day for the last three months.

                         DIETZ
                  (stabbing the air
                   with the packets)
          All I wanna know is how are these
          guys supposed to be holding up
          Tarzana City National on August 2nd,
          when they are in Fort-fucking-
          Lauderdale August 2ND!!!

                         HARP
          Not an easy thing to do, is it,
          Utah?

                         UTAH
          Aw shit.

                         PAPPAS
          Nice tattoo, Dietz.

We hear a faint BUZZ, growing louder as we...

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - DAWN

The doorbell BUZZ shrieks through the room.  It stops.
Starts again.  A ghostly dawn finds UTAH and TYLER
sleeping peacefully, limbs entwined like vines.
Johnny's eyes snap open.  Spies the clock.  4:00 a.m.
Tyler stirs beside him, coming out of sleep.
Johnny wraps a blanket around his waist and staggers to
the door.

BODHI stands outside the door wearing a lunatic grin.
Behind him NATHANIEL, ROACH and GROMMET hoot from the
pickup.

                         BODHI
          C'mon brah, there's a righteous
          swell.  Let's go!  Let's go!

Tyler comes into the room, wrapped in a sheet.
Utah sees her knowing smile.

                         TYLER
          He does this.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  BEACH - PREDAWN

Vampire morning.  A misty predawn, bled of all color.
Steel gray tones.  The ocean vanishes in the fog a few
feet from shore.
Tyler and Johnny, carrying their boards, walk toward the
water.

                         TYLER
          Come on, Utah.  Everybody's out
          there catchin' all the good rides.

She realizes he has stopped ten feet behind her, like a
great weight has dragged him to a halt.

                         TYLER
          What's wrong Johnny?
                  (goes back to him)
          You're like a different person.

He stares at her.  His expression dark... wrestling with
something.

                         UTAH
          I am a different person, Tyler.

He lets out a long breath and looks away, out to sea.

JOHNNY'S POV... the water receding into a backlit wall of
mist.
FIGURES APPEAR, faint silhouettes in the fog.
Shades of gray in the gray.
IN SLOW MOTION they weave hypnotically across the screen,
their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each
other.

STACKED UP BY THE EXTREME LONG LENS, Bodhi, Roach, Grommet
and Nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical
grace.

In SUSPENDED TIME we see them hooting and grinning at each
other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other.
Dolphins playing.
Challenging each other in mock combat.
So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to
spare.
There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration.
Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art.
For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe,
by themselves.  It dawns on us...
There are four of them.
And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi,
laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty
wig-wagging moon.

TRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open.
Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride toward
him.

IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel's
shining white butt.

ON JOHNNY, as he reacts to the dawning certainty.
He feels weak, dizzy... like the ground is moving under
him.

                         TYLER
          Hey.  You okay?  You look like you
          saw a ghost.

SHOCK CUT -- ANGELO TURNING TOWARD HIM, at the drop car
scene.  Eons ago.  The sound of his voice ringing...

                         PAPPAS
          Forget about it, kid, They're
          ghosts...

BACK TO JOHNNY, as he backs away from Tyler.  Still in
shock, recoiling from the situation.

                         UTAH
          I... I gotta go.

                         TYLER
          Johnny... what's going on?  I don't
          get it... did I do something?

                         UTAH
          No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go.
          I'll, uh... I'll call you later.
          I'm sorry.

He sets off running up the beach.
Tyler stares after him.  Confused and hurt.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PAPPAS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Early evening.  Utah pulls into the driveway.  When he
kills the engine we hear Greek music from inside the
house.

AT THE ENTRANCE Johnny finds the door ajar.  He pushes it
open a little to reveal--


INT.  HOUSE

Pappas dancing alone in the living room with his shirt
off, holding a glass of ouzo.  Facing away from the door
the ample Greek hears Utah's tentative knock.  Without
breaking from his dance or turning he calls out--

                         PAPPAS
          Hey, babe.  Get on over here so the
          big dog can teach ya how to bark.

Pappas howls like a bloodhound, then twirls around.

                         UTAH
          Woof, woof.

We see the startled Pappas, at a loss for the first time.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call
          first, you know?  Hey, where the
          hell were you all day?  You gotta at
          least call in or something.  You
          okay?

                         UTAH
          Angelo, we gotta talk.

Pappas moves toward him, kind of subconsciously herding
Utah back out the door.

                         PAPPAS
          Listen, uh... if you're okay, can it
          wait till tomorrow morning, kid,
          I...

Johnny hears footsteps and turns.
Miss Deer comes through the door like it's not the first
time, carrying a bag of groceries.

                         MISS DEER
          Angie, they didn't have the kind of
          wine you like but I got... oh, hi
          Johnny!

Her icy office persona obviously got left there.  Her hair
is unbound and flows around her shoulders, and in halter
top and jeans she looks delectably off-duty.

Angelo looks at Utah like don't you say a fucking word.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  HOUSE

A few minutes later.  Utah and Pappas leaning on his car.
The younger agent seems to have regained his hunt-down
fever.

                         UTAH
          ... so I started tailing him.

                         PAPPAS
          This Zen master surfer.

                         UTAH
          Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day,
          right.  He goes here, he goes there,
          he goes to Tower Records and buys
          come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's
          Road House...
                  (mock casual)
          ... he goes into the Assured Trust
          Savings and Loan.

                         PAPPAS
          Did he rob it?

                         UTAH
          Cute.  He was inside for about 20
          minutes.  The other guy, Roach,
          waited in the truck.  They were
          scoping it out, right?!

                         UTAH
          Yeah, or cashing a check.

                         UTAH
          Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back
          to their beach house and box up all
          their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's
          truck and take it to a public
          storage unit.  You see?  Summer's
          almost over.  They're splitting.
          They're gonna pick up a little
          traveling money tomorrow.  The next
          day at the outside latest.  I got a
          feeling.

                         PAPPAS
          Last time you got a feeling I had to
          kill a man, which I always hate
          because it looks bad on the report.

                         UTAH
          Angelo... I'm right this time.  We
          can still win this one.

Angelo looks at the conviction in the other agent's eyes.
Pappas sighs and puts a hand on Johnny's shoulder.

                         PAPPAS
          Alright, look... banks are closed.
          Nothing's gonna go down tonight,
          right?  So we'll be on these guys
          like white on rice... first thing
          tomorrow morning.  Okay?  Tomorrow.
          Okay?

Utah nods.  Then grins.  Pappas starts backing up, like a
long rubber band which was stretched taut is pulling him
back into the house.

                         UTAH
          Woof, woof.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET NEAR BODHI'S HOUSE - DAY

LONG LENS POV scanning Bodhi's house.  There is a "FOR
RENT" sign out front.  The driveway and carpet are
empty... no vehicles in sight.

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          They're gone.  Son of a bitch.  We
          missed them.

UTAH LOWERS HIS BINOCULARS.  He's standing next to the car
while Pappas sits on the hood, sipping coffee from a
thermos.

                         PAPPAS
          They're on their way to Maui.

                         UTAH
          No way.  Not yet.  Come on.

Utah jumps in and starts the car.  Pappas is screwing the
cap on the thermos.  Johnny puts the car in gear, forcing
Angelo to scramble in as the car starts to roll.

                         PAPPAS
          Jesus Christ, kid!  The banks don't
          open 'till nine.


EXT.  CITY STREET - TRAFFIC - DAY

Johnny weaves the sedan among the creeping commuters.
Long glittering lines and heat waves.

                         UTAH
          I say we call it in.  Get some
          backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp
          won't listen to me.

                         PAPPAS
          Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call
          up and tell him his favorite agent
          saw this one surfer moon another
          surfer yesterday and it looked real
          suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably
          call out the National Guard.

                         UTAH
          I say we don't call it in.  Under no
          circumstance are we to call this in.

                         PAPPAS
          Look, we handle it ourselves, for
          right now, okay?  We cover the bank,
          whatever.  You and me.  That way if
          nothing happens, or more accurately,
          when nothing happens... I don't get
          my tits any further into the wringer
          than they already are.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  ASSURED TRUST SAVING AND LOAN

SLOW PAN from the facade of the bank halfway up the block
to Utah's sedan in the TIGHT F.G.  Head flopped back over
the seat, Angelo snoozes in the hot sun with a sports page
over his face.  Johnny looks at his watch for the fiftieth
time.  Whole lot of nothing going on.

Angelo slides the sports page down to his chin, without
otherwise moving.

                         PAPPAS
          Time for lunch.

                         UTAH
          Angelo, it's eleven thirty.

                         PAPPAS
          That place up the street has
          meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.

Utah slides out of the car.  Feeling a little exposed he
pulls his Dodgers cap down a little tighter, and adjusts
his sunglasses.
He trudges off through the sidewalk crowd toward the FAST-
FOOD STAND nearby.
Pappas pulls the sports page back up to block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  FAST FOOD PLACE

ON A LONG LENS, very stacked up, we see Johnny standing at
the grody pick-up window.  He keeps looking at the bank,
visible B.G.
The pick-up window opens and food appears, sliding out.
Utah turns, pulling out his wallet.

                         VOICE FROM INSIDE
          Two meatball, one tuna on wheat,
          two lemonades.  Total's seven eighty
          four.

As Johnny is counting out the bills, a BURGUNDY
THUNDERBIRD pulls up in front of the bank.  The doors fly
open.
The Ex-Presidents jump out.
They sprint for the entrance.  All this OUT OF FOCUS, B.G.
Johnny misses it as he picks up the food order.
The Presidents disappear inside.
Johnny looks toward the bank again.  There is no movement.

REVERSE, as Utah walks back toward his car.  Pappas is
still under the paper.  He slides it down when he smells
food.

                         UTAH
          Here, yours is the one that looks
          like a road kill.  Enjoy.

Utah throws a big stack of napkins through the window into
Pappas' lap.  Still standing next to the car.

                         UTAH
          Here's your lemonade.
                  (he looks down the
                   street)
          Did you see that T-Bird pull up?

Pappas pulls a disgusting mass from the bag, unwrapping
one end.

                         PAPPAS
                  (without looking)
          Damn, I could eat the ass out of an
          elephant.  I shoulda had you get me
          three a these.  What T-Bird?

Pappas is about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls
out of the end of the sandwich.  It lands on the seat next
to him.
He looks at it.  Picks it up.  Pops it into his mouth
and--
Freezes, mouth open.  Eyes focused on...
The Ex-Presidents, in living color, flashing through the
doors of the bank 80 feet away.

Johnny is so astounded he doesn't do anything for about
two seconds.  Pappas coughs out his meatball, eyes
bugging.

                         PAPPAS
          Jesus Christ!!  It's them!

The Presidents are piling into the car.
Johnny reacts characteristically.  He whips out the
Beretta and yells--

                         UTAH
          FBI!!  Freeze!!  Right now!

NIXON spins, raising his shotgun.
But Reagan knocks the muzzle down with his hand.  Shoves
him into the car.  Then Reagan jumps behind the wheel.
The back wheels light up, smoking, as the T-Bird launches.

Utah FIRES.
BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!
He puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into
junk jewelry.  The T-Bird peels out into traffic, clipping
a Subaru which locks them up and spins.

                         PAPPAS
          Come on, kid, get in the car!
          Jesus!


INT./ EXT.  SEDAN

Pappas reaches across, starting the engine as Johnny jumps
in the driver's side.  Utah buries the throttle into the
firewall and charges aggressively through the medium
traffic.
Their sedan slews around the back of an eighteen wheeler,
fishtailing.  It straightens out.  No T-Bird in sight.

                         UTAH
          The hell are they?!

                         PAPPAS
          They took a left at the next light!

                         UTAH
          You sure?!

Utah is totally wired.  Totally concentrated.  The
adrenalin is kicking in, flashing through his system.  His
brain is on turbo boost, reacting a thousand times a
second as they hit sixty through the traffic, which seems
to be standing still.

                         UTAH
          I got 'em.  I see 'em.  I'm on it,
          I'm on it.

High-speed slalom through cars and trucks.
The world passes by in a hysterical blur.

                         PAPPAS
          You even watching the road?

A car pulls out, straight ahead.
Utah swerves wildly, mostly gets around him.  The guy's
bumper and front grille are removed.  Utah does a smoking
skid-recovery.  Doesn't even slow down.

The late model T-Bird is weaving manically.  It makes a
sliding turn onto a cross street half a block ahead of the
FBI agents.

Utah cuts the wheel into a huge Ralph's parking lot.
Pedestrians scatter.  Utah center-punches a week's supply
of groceries in a cart.


INT./ EXT.  T-BIRD

The Presidents hold on desperately as Reagan white-
knuckles it through civilian traffic.  They're looking all
around, trying to see where Utah went.

                         LBJ
          Where are they, man?  I don't see
          'em.  We lose 'em?

Not exactly... THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see an airborne
Utah hurtling from a Ralph's entrance.  The sedan lands on
the street, tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the
undercarriage.
An instant later it hammers into the side of the T-Bird.

The two cars spin out of control.  Utah cuts the wheel,
slamming into them again.  Side by side demolition derby.
WHAM!!  Utah hits them again.  The Presidents lose
control, jumping a curb, losing the right front tire in
the process.

Utah's car starts to swap ends.  Hit the center island
broadside.
The sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass.
SCREECH of steel on concrete as it comes to rest.
Hanging upside down, Pappas is mightily pissed off.

                         PAPPAS
          Nice fuckin' work, hotshot.
          Christ!

They can see the T-Bird still moving.
It slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on
flapping rubber.

Johnny shimmies out of the wreckage, sliding on his back
in broken glass.  Pappas is packed in, upside down,
wriggling to get out through the side window.  A tight
fit.


INT./ EXT.  T-BIRD

The Presidents are hammered up and down by the flailing
tire.

                         REAGAN
          Emergency sanitization!  Here we go!


EXT.  GAS STATION

The T-Bird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a
smoking stop at one of the pump islands.  The Presidents
explode out of the car in a blur.

Reagan bodyslams a TEENAGER putting gas in his MUSTANG.
He flips his big pistol to LBJ as the other Presidents
charge past him.  Nixon jumps behind the wheel of the
Mustang.  LBJ and JFK pile in.

Reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car.
He pulls out a ZIPPO LIGHTER.
Reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the
zippo below and slightly in front of it.  He flicks the
flame.
Then pulls the trigger on the nozzle.

Like an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews A TWENTY
FOOT JET OF FIRE which engulfs the T-Bird in an instant.
Any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated.
Customers are running, screaming.
Nixon has the Mustang fired up.

                         NIXON
          Let's go!  Move it, Ronny!

Ronny's eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the
scene with the jet of fire.  You can see it getting good
to him.  In a second he's going to blow up the whole
block.  But he's getting his rocks off.  He sets two other
cars on fire.

A FIGURE BLURS INTO FRAME.
In a flying tackle, Utah catapults Reagan off his pins.
They roll, skidding across the oily concrete.
Spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island.

Out of the black smoke, PAPPAS charges like an angry bull,
his snubnose held high.  NIXON sees him and floors it.
The Mustang smokes out of the gas station as Pappas' shots
blow out the back window.

Utah and Reagan roll away from the blaze.  Johnny's pants
are burning.  He gets to his knees in time for Reagan's
kick to take him square in the solar plexus.  He folds in
half.  Drops to the cement.
Reagan kicks him again and takes off running.
The President is burning.
His suit jacket is ablaze.  He shucks out of it as he
runs.

Gasping, Johnny rapidly slaps his jeans.  Puts himself
out.  He comes up running, pulling his Beretta.  Sees the
back of Reagan's head disappearing into an alley behind
the gas station.


EXT.  ALLEY

A non-descript L.A. alley... commercial buildings on one
side, walled suburb on the other.  Two men running all
out.
A recent President and a wild-eyed cop trailing smoke like
a crashing jet fighter.

Beyond the buildings behind them A FIREBALL EXPLODES
SKYWARD.  We hear sirens and shouting, which recede as the
two pelt along the alley.  It gets quieter.  Just the
machine-gun slap of the shoes on pavement, and the hard
breathing of the two men, each in overdrive, going all out
in long blurring strides.

REAGAN looks back.  Sees the demon cop behind him,
gaining.
Utah has become an engine, a running machine... juggernaut
mode.

AHEAD OF THEM a BLACK AND WHITE swings into the alley.
Reagan hangs a hard left and blasts a wooden gate half off
its hinges.  Utah whips through the gate a second later.
Diving into suburbia.


INT./ EXT.  NEIGHBORHOOD - FOOTCHASE SEQUENCE

It becomes a blur.  Pure kinetic energy.  Two meteors
rocketing through a low-rent suburb.  And God help anyone
who gets in the way.

Reagan crosses a cluttered backyard.
Broken field run through toys, swing set, stacks of god-
knows-what.
He runs through a Mr. Turtle Pool in an explosion of
spray.
Crashes through a hedge.
Through the narrow gap between houses.
Utah powers into the tight space behind him.
Blurring along between stucco walls.

They emerge into the front yard.
A WOMAN watering her lawn is so surprised she yelps and
falls down.
Reagan and Utah both hurdle her.

AHEAD, KIDS ON BIKES, racing along the sidewalk.
Reagan dodges the first, Utah slams into the next two.
He crashes, rolling, tangled up in bikes and squawking
teenagers.
He comes out of a pile-up somehow still in high gear.

Reagan flashes across the sunlit street.
Dodges in front of a GARBAGE TRUCK which locks up the
brakes.
It stops so fast, one of the guys falls off the back.
The GUY is getting up as Utah whips around the back of the
truck.
Knocks him sprawling.
Utah doesn't stop.  Doesn't look back.
Like he doesn't see anything in the real world but the
figure running ahead of him.  Like it's some kind of
hyperkinetic video game.

Everything is a blur.  Suburbia smeared into staccato
impressions.
The house across the street is blocked by fence on both
sides.
A MAN is picking up his mail.
Reagan pounds past him.  Right through the front door of
the house.
Utah follows.

Panting as he sprints down a dark hallway.
A WOMAN with a basket of washing SCREAMS as Reagan blasts
past her, knocking her flying.
Utah leaps over her sprawled legs.
Cats blur underfoot.  Utah crunches down on a tail.  A CAT
EXPLOSION.  Screeching merges with the woman's shrill
shouts as Utah slams the back screen door off its hinges.

Across the back yard.  Fence.  Over it.  Running on.

REAGAN looks back.
Sees Utah still behind him like in a bad dream.
He enters the next house.  Sliding glass door.
Utah sees Reagan pull it closed.  Locking it.
Without breaking stride Johnny grabs a potted plant off a
patio wall.
Heaves it ahead of him.

The glass BURST INTO A WALL OF DIAMONDS.
Utah blasts through a microsecond later.
Topples the kitchen table.  Furniture and crockery
crashing everywhere.
He sprints down a hallway after Reagan.
A FIERCE WOMAN in a housecoat shouting at them as they
pass, holding a vacuum cleaner like it's shot-gun.

                         WOMAN
          Get the fuck out of this house!
          What the fuck do you think you're
          doing--

Around a corner.  A VICIOUS SNARLING SOUND.
Utah sees something flying at him.  Reflexively catches
it.
Reagan has thrown a PIT-BULL.
The Fierce Woman's fierce dog.

UTAH'S POV -- the snarling little demon right in his face.
He drop-kicks it like a goddamn field-goal right through a
doorway and runs on.
Another door.  Another explosion of sunlight.  Another
yard.
Sprinklers this time.  Reagan and Utah running through
sunlit walls of rain.  They crash through another hedge.
Emerging drenched.

The ground drops away.  Slipping and sliding on iceplant,
they skid down a steep slope.  Reagan reaches bottom.
A TEN FOOT RETAINING WALL, dropping off like a cliff to
pavement below.
Reagan falls, landing on his feet.
Panting now, feeling it, he stumbles up and runs on.

Utah rips down through the iceplant like a human
lawnmower.
Slides over the edge.  Falls -- lands hard.

TIGHT ON HIS KNEE and SLOW MOTION.
Taking the impact.
We HEAR something go.
Utah crashes to the pavement, his face contorted with
pain.
He grabs his tortured knee with both hands.

                         UTAH
          Not now.  Not now!

Reagan runs on.  They are in an enclosed storage yard of
some kind.  Ten foot chainlink all around.
Utah struggles to get up and run.
He sprawls forward, biting back a howl of pain.
We see the incredible will driving him on.
He gets up and again, hobbling.  Trying to run.

Reagan reaches the fence.
He is heaving for breath.  Holding his side.
Utah stumbles, gets up, clutching his knee.
Hobbling forward.  His eyes wild, the veins in his neck
bulging.

Reagan starts to climb.  Utah collapses to his knees.  He
can't go on.
Reagan reaches the top of the fence.  He looks back.

UTAH HAS THE BERETTA POINTED RIGHT AT HIM.
Twenty feet away.  The muzzle rock-steady.  He can't miss.
They both are frozen, panting.  Locked into the moment.

                         REAGAN
          You want me, there's only one way.

PAPPAS reaches the top of the hill, 200 feet away, panting
like he's about to collapse.  He sees the tableau.

ECU -- UTAH'S FINGER on the trigger.  Tightening.
RACK TO his eyes.  Blinking, water running into them.
God, he wants to.

ECU -- REAGAN'S EYES, through the mask.  Locked with
Utah's.

UTAH suddenly snaps his hand up and FIRES VERTICALLY.
HE HOWLS WITH RAGE, FRUSTRATION AND PAIN.
FIRES AGAIN.  And AGAIN.
Slumping back, his shoulders slam down onto the concrete.
Straight-arming the Beretta he FIRES RAPIDLY...
Bulleting the blue sky.

HIGH ANGLE, looking straight down on the tableau.
Reagan leaps off the fence and runs OUT OF FRAME, as Utah
empties the magazine straight at us, the shots merging
with his agonized howl, echoing as we--

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  FBI BUILDING - BULLPEN - NIGHT

UTAH sits next to the DISPATCHER waiting for news like a
sailor in a storm.  His leg is popped up on a chair with
jeans split to the thigh and an ace bandage wrapped around
his knee.
His face is a nasty patchwork of scratches and bruises.
He drains his coffee and gazes out at the empty bullpen.

PAPPAS comes through the doors, wiping the remains of
dinner off his mouth.

                         PAPPAS
          Nothing?

                         UTAH
          Nothing.

The Dispatcher talks into his headset, glances up at
Pappas, shakes his head.

                         PAPPAS
          Go home, kid.  Get the hell outta
          here.  Get some sleep.  You look
          like shit.  They get anything even
          resembles your guy, I'm on your
          beeper.  Here.  You like feta?

He smiles warmly, handing his younger partner a brown
paper sack.

                         UTAH
          Feta.  My favorite.

Managing a weary smile.  Lifts his body out of the chair,
turns to go.
Angelo ponders something.

                         PAPPAS
          Johnny...

Utah stops.  Looks back at the man.

                         PAPPAS
          All I wanna know is one thing, why
          didn't you just take the shot?

Johnny's gaze turns inward.

                         UTAH
          I don't know.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BATHROOM - UTAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

UTAH sits on the bathroom floor as Tyler dabs Betadyne
antiseptic over his wounds.  Utah cringes.

                         UTAH
          Ouch.

                         TYLER
          Betadyne doesn't hurt.

                         UTAH
          You're kneeling on my hand.

She laughs, shifts her weight and keeps tending him.

                         TYLER
          So what'd the other guy look like?

                         UTAH
          Never saw him, was your basic hit
          and run.

                         TYLER
          But you look like you been in a
          train wreck, how'd he just drive
          away?

Utah acts like he wants to say something but his mouth
won't quite form the words.  Tyler dabs his face, touches
a finger to his forehead.

                         TYLER
          Johnny, what is it with you?  You
          have that look again, it's like
          you're about to tell me something
          and then you don't... or you can't.
          What's going on?

Johnny searches her eyes.
She stares at him, becoming fragile suddenly.

                         TYLER
          What?  What do you want to tell me?

Utah's brow unfurls.  The thought has passed.  He slowly
cups his hand over hers.  Gently pulling her close.

                         UTAH
          I'm glad you pulled me out of the
          water that day...

He presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead.
A kiss to each downcast eye.  Searching out her mouth with
his own as his hands glide down the small of her back.
Their reflection in the mirror as Utah slowly lowers Tyler
to the bathroom floor.  She clings tightly in a breathless
kiss.


EXT.  CLIFF - NIGHT

A Buddha in the moonlight, BODHI sits crosslegged upon the
cliff, staring at the ocean.
CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND HIM, focusing in upon his eyes.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

UTAH asleep, flopped in a spread-eagled X.
WE HEAR the bedroom door opening, see a slash of light
fall across the bed.
Johnny doesn't stir.
A shadow appears on the wall, moving toward him.
An outstretched arm holding a gun.
Utah snores softly, sleeping like a baby.
CAMERA TRACKS IN on his peaceful face.
A single eyelid flutters.  Total silence, until...

KABOOOOMMM!  The Pillow beside him EXPLODES into a
blizzard of goosedown.  Johnny rears up, eyes wide, mouth
agape.
TYLER stands above him, recovering from the kick of the
smoking 9mm Beretta in her hand.

                         TYLER
          A lawyer!?  You lied to me!

She throws his FBI gold star at his face.

                         TYLER
          Look, Tyler, I can--

BOOM!  Tyler SQUEEZES off another round.
Cascading goosefeathers falling like snow.
Utah flinches sideways.

                         TYLER
          Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been
          using me!  Your jacket's on the
          floor in the bathroom -- this
          goddamn thing's half out of the
          pocket... Oh God, it's all part of
          some case, isn't it?

                         UTAH
          Tyler, put the gun down.

                         TYLER
          You tell me the fucking truth
          Johnny... did your parents really
          die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!

She waves the Beretta in his face.

                         UTAH
          No.  They live in Columbus Ohio.

Tyler lowers the pistol slowly, the strength leaving her.
Her face begins to flood with tears.

                         UTAH
          I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after
          are surfers.  I needed you, at
          first, but not--

                         TYLER
          Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!!
          Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you
          to hell!

She goes limp as the sobs rack her body.  The gun flops
from her grip.
Utah sweeps it under the bed with his foot.
He moves to gently comfort her.
She bolts at his touch, running from the bedroom.
Utah is up and hopping into his pants to follow her.  He
stumbles.

                         UTAH
          Tyler!  Wait!!

From the living room we hear a rattling of keys, the front
door opens and slams shut.  He hobbles to the door,
favoring his knee.  Opens it.  We hear the Porsche
screeching away.
Utah sags, the breath coming out of him long and slow.

                                            CUT TO:

UTAH on the bed staring up at the ceiling.  Phone cradled,
listening to--

                         TYLER (V.O.)
          Hi, it's me.  Leave a message.

BEEP!  He rests the telephone on his chest, letting the
tape roll a moment before he speaks.

                         UTAH
          Tyler I... look, I fucked up, okay.
          I know I fucked up.  I wanted to
          tell you, but I couldn't -- I was
          afraid you'd leave... good guess,
          huh?
                  (grimacing)
          Fuck, why can't I ever say what I
          really mean?  I lied to you.  I'm an
          asshole... but I need you, Tyler.  I
          want you to know that I've never
          known anyone like you before in my
          life... and I... I hope you change
          your mind...

He cradles the receiver, looks out the window.  Black of
night.  Dead still.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

UTAH asleep, telephone still perched on his bare chest.

BUZZZZZZ!  The rasp of the doorbell.
Johnny is airborne, phone flying across the floor.
Hunting for his pants, realizes they are already on, limps
in fast motion to the door.

                         UTAH
          Tyler!  Wait, I--

Whips it open.
BODHI standing in the doorway, smiling like an excited
child.

                         BODHI
          Howdy brah.

NATHANIEL, ROACH, and GROMMET are there behind him.
They look like sentry dogs.  Johnny freezes.
Bodhi walks past Utah, into the room.

                         BODHI
          C'mon, get your gear on, we're
          rollin'.

Cheerful, hardly able to contain his exuberance.
He moves through the room, grabbing Johnny's shirt from a
chair, a pair of sneakers on the floor.
Utah sees his FBI shield sitting on the dresser in plain
sight.
He palms it when Bodhi is turned away, and slips it into
his hip pocket to conceal it.

                         UTAH
          What going on, Bodhi?

Bodhi plucks a couple socks off the couch, hands them to
Utah.

                         BODHI
          Here.
                  (spying Johnny's cut
                   face)
          Hey, what happened?  Ya cut
          yourself shaving?

Johnny meets Bodhi's cold stare.

                         UTAH
          I don't think I wanna surf right
          now.

Bodhi's face takes on a crazy glow.

                         BODHI
          Naw, this is different, Johnny.
          This is something totally
          different... you're gonna love this.

He winds an arm around Johnny's shoulders, guides him
toward the door.

                         BODHI
          C'mon, let's go, let's go.  Time's
          wastin', brah.

Bodhi claps Utah on the back, ushering him outside.
Nathaniel, Roach and Grommet fall into step beside them.
The door closes behind them.
CAMERA DRIFTS back through the apartment, coming to rest
on the 9mm Beretta, on the floor under the bed... useless.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  BODHI'S PICKUP - PREDAWN

The pickup is a funnel of dust along the desert road.
Black mountains against a silver sky.


INT.  BODHI'S PICKUP

The tapedeck blasts.  BODHI and UTAH sit inside the cab.
Through the rear window, we see NATHANIEL, ROACH and
GROMMET in the flatbed.
Bodhi swivels his eyes to Johnny, lowers the volume.

                         BODHI
          Life's sure got a sick sense of
          humor, don't you think so Johnny?

Face splitting into a shit-eating grin.

                         UTAH
          How you figure?

                         BODHI
                  (slight laugh)
          News, last night... those guys, the
          Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank
          yesterday.  And I was just there the
          day before, cashing a check.  See...
          look.  Assured Trust... same place.

He takes a beat up checkbook off the dash and flips it to
Johnny.
Utah opens the cover and looks.
Sure enough.  Assured Trust Savings and Loan.

                         BODHI
          I was picking up some bucks cause
          we're leaving town.  Bizarre, huh?
          If I'd waited a day I'd been right
          in the middle of it.  Kinda sorry I
          missed it.  I'd liked to've seen
          them.

A long pregnant pause.  Utah breathes deeply, remaining
calm, his voice carrying a chilling bravado.

                         UTAH
          Takes guts to rob a bank.  All that
          adrenalin pumping, waving loaded
          guns, taking out the guards, getting
          everybody on the floor, never
          knowin' who's gonna burst in...
                  (looks right at
                   Bodhi)
          ... wondering what it's like to take
          a bullet.  Must be some ride.

Utah's smile is a personal challenge.  Bodhi sits
perversely intrigued.  The mental warfare escalates.

                         BODHI
          Banks are insured, brah.  Long as
          nobody gets shot, it's really a
          victimless crime.  Just gotta scare
          'em a little, would be my guess.
                  (ponders something)
          Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with
          all those guys wearin' body armor
          these days, know what I'd carry?

Bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat.
He pulls out a huge holstered handgun, rests it in his
lap, draws and holds the gun up against his cheek.

                         BODHI
          .454 Casull.  Most powerful handgun
          on the planet.  Muzzle velocity of
          2000 feet per second.  Twice the
          kinetic energy of a .44 Magnum.

Bodhi stares at Utah, then flashes his signature smile.
Utah says coldly.

                         UTAH
          One shot stopping.

                         BODHI
                  (laughs)
          'One shot stopping'... good, very
          good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like
          you because you'll sacrifice
          anything to win.  I respect that.
          It elevates you a little above the
          drones who have learned compromise.
          Here, hold it.  Check out the
          weight.

He twirls the gun, grabs the barrel and extends the handle
to Utah.
Johnny takes it slowly.  Now it's aimed at Bodhi.

                         BODHI
                  (cheerfully)
          Whoa.  Careful.  You got the muzzle
          pointing right at me, brah.

He casually pushes the barrel away, looking back at the
highway.
Johnny swings a stiff arm out his window and pumps a ROUND
into open desert.  KABOOOM!!  The recoil blows Johnny's
arm back over the top of the truck.  Practically breaks
his wrist.
Thunder rolls across the dark hills.
From the back of the pickup Nathaniel howls.
Grommet and Roach high five.

Johnny turns to Bodhi, breaking slowly into a feral grin.

                         UTAH
          Nice.

He hands the smoking weapon back to him.
As if to say "two can play this game".
Bodhi stands challenged.
Each snared in the other's power...
Bodhi takes the weapon back, casually.  Slips it under the
seat.

                         BODHI
          It's a special day, Johnny U.  A
          very special day...

Utah's gaze travels beyond the windshield.
Where tentacles of brand new morning light vein the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  DESERT AIRSTRIP

TIGHT ON A turbo-prop engine ROARING.

WIDER reveals a big Cessna twin.  The PILOT, a weaselly
guy we haven't seen before, fires up the second engine.
The plane shudders eagerly in the metallic predawn light.
A desert airstrip near Palmdale.  A couple of aluminum-
siding hangers and no tower.  A few other planes around
but no activity besides Bodhi's rock-steady crew.

UTAH watches Grommet whip back a tarp in the bed of
Bodhi's truck and starts tossing out PARACHUTE PACKS.
Roach tosses one to Bodhi, who chucks it to Utah.

                         BODHI
          Ever done this before?

                         UTAH
          Once.

                         BODHI
          Pure adrenalin, right?!  The
          ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for
          it, jab a vein for it -- all you
          gotta do is jump.

                         UTAH
          Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I
          sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--

                         BODHI
          Yeah, I noticed you limping.
                  (grins)
          But don't worry about it, brah.
          Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna
          land on land!

Bodhi grabs his sleeve, ushering him into the plane.

                         UTAH
          Oh, well, that's fine then.  I feel
          so much better.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CESSNA

Utah sits, wearing a day-glo jump suit, hugging the chute
in his lap.  Next to him is the gaping door.  Beyond... a
spectacular down sunburst at 10,000 feet.  ROAR of wind
and engines.

Utah watches Bodhi, Nathaniel, Grommet and Roach wriggling
into their colorful freefall suits.  Nathaniel pulls on a
pair of purple shorts over his suit.  Looks real dorky.
Grommet has on duck feet.  Bodhi, apparently, is going to
jump barefoot.
Nobody has their chutes on yet.
Johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the
contents.  His brain is racing.  Bodhi shouts over the
roar.

                         BODHI
          It's a little ceremony we always
          have at the end of summer.  One last
          speedstar.

                         UTAH
          So, who... uh, who packed my chute?

                         BODHI
          I did.  What's the matter?  Don't
          trust me?

                         UTAH
          You gotta earn trust.

                         BODHI
          Then we'll earn it together.  Here,
          take mine.

Bodhi swaps chutes with Johnny.
Utah looks at the new chute uncertainly.
Is this a game?  Poker moves?
Did Bodhi anticipate this step?

                         ROACH
          Hey... you don't want Bodhi's, man.
          His pack-jobs suck... they only open
          half the time.  Take Grommet's, man.

Roach's grin is evil as he grabs Grommet's chute out of
his hands and switches it with Johnny's.  Keeps that one
and gives his to Grommet.

                         GROMMET
          Whoa, unfair, dude!

Grommet grabs his chute back and hands Johnny the one he
had, which was Roach's.  I think.
Johnny looks at the pack in his hands.  Then at the
grinning faces.
Russian surfer freefall roulette.  Shit.
Bodhi studying him.  Some kind of test.
Fuck it.  Utah starts putting the damn thing on.

                         UTAH
          We gonna jump or jerk off?

                         BODHI
          My man!


EXT.  10,000 FEET - DAWN

Multi-colored figures explode from the plane.  Leaping
into freefall.  Tumbling end over end.
WEARING HEADSETS, they hurtle downward.

                         BODHI (RADIO)
          Utah, you copy bruddah?

                         UTAH (RADIO)
          Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!

                         BODHI
          I'll take that as a yes.

One by one they stabilize.  Falling face down, knees bent,
they angle their hands and feet minutely to move
laterally.  Utah flails, the last to trim out.  But he's
holding his own.

Grommet, working his duckfeet, pitches himself into a wild
spin, rotating like a dervish in a head down dive.  He
flares out and "flies" back to the others.
Rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to
paradoxically hang above the world, almost unmoving... on
a separate plane of existence.
A hurricane of wind.  Wild HOOTING.
Despite his terror, Johnny has to grin at Nathaniel,
falling butt first like he's sitting on a big inner tube
in the pool.

                         ROACH
          Whip it out dudes!  Cheap sex with
          the cosmos!

                         BODHI
          Ten thousand feet.  Let's do it.

The group stabilizes, moving together.
First Bodhi and Roach link arms, trimming constantly.
Concentrating.  Nathaniel flips over onto his stomach and
maneuvers toward them.  He grabs Roach's arm.
Grommet works his way next to Nathaniel.  Locks in.
They need Utah to complete the ring.
Four faces beckoning to him, distorted by the hurricane
wind.

                         BODHI
          Come on Johnny.  Get in here!

Johnny moves his hands like flippers and glides clumsily
toward them.  Bodhi and Grommet grab him.  He's in.
A perfect five-man star.

                         BODHI
          Relax, brah.  I got you, I got you.

                         GROMMET
          Righteous-ass speedstar, dudes!

                         BODHI
          You diggin' this?

                         UTAH
          Great!  GREAT!

Johnny is exhilarated more than he could have thought.
Screaming down through the dawn sky at 130.
Locked into the ring.  Part of something.
Connected to these guys far above the planet.
Less far every second... Bodhi's chest altimeter reads
6,000 feet.

                         BODHI
          Purty-thirty and we're meat waffles,
          folks.  See ya downtown!

He releases Roach's arm and the star disintegrates,
drifting apart.
Bodhi stays with Utah, falling parallel to the horizon,
facing each other, holding hands.  4000 feet.  Airspeed
140.

Grommet pulls his ripcord.  He seems to be jerked upward
by a great force.  Suddenly he is far above, a brightly
colored disc of fabric.
Utah is suddenly aware of the earth rushing up at him.
Nathaniel pulls, then Roach.  They shoot upward,
disappearing.
Bodhi and Utah fall on, alone.

                         BODHI
          You gonna pull?

                         UTAH
          After you, Alfonse.  I insist!

Bodhi looks at Utah.  A slow grin.  The meter on his chest
harness reads 2000 ft.  150 mph.  12 seconds to Valhalla.

                         BODHI
          Don't screw around man, pull it!

                         UTAH
          You do it... you first!

                         BODHI
          One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn
          cord!

                         UTAH
          You first!

                         BODHI
          Okay!

Bodhi reaches out suddenly and pulls Utah's ripcord
handle.
He waves goodbye as Johnny's canopy deploys.  Utah is
jerked upward.  He feels his weight hanging brutally in
the harness.
Johnny looks down.
Impossibly close to the ground.  Bodhi's canopy BURSTS
OUT, an explosion of color.  Below him is the shimmering
mirror of a LARGE RESERVOIR.  Two seconds later the bright
yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack.  An
explosion of white water marks Bodhi's impact.

LOW ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL as Utah hits.
IN SLOW MOTION a glorious wall of backlit spray shouts
skyward.
Molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn.
Utah surfaces, sputtering, and shucks out of the harness.
He floats like a jellyfish, gasping for breath.

                         UTAH
          Jesus Christ.  I gotta be losin' it.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  AIRFIELD - DAY

Bodhi walks toward us, dripping wet and grinning.
He wraps his arm around Utah's shoulders as the others
walk up.
They're all soaked and stoked.

                         BODHI
          Ya see... I told you Johnny U was
          gonna be just fine!

Roach and the others clap him on the back.  A moment of
acceptance into the tribe.  Utah isn't sure what it means
yet.

                         BODHI
          C'mere.  There's something you need
          to see.

Bodhi leads him toward a PLAIN UTILITY VAN parked nearby.
It was there earlier but Utah had no reason to notice it.
Bodhi opens the rear doors and motions Johnny inside.
Utah, puzzled and suddenly alert, steps in.  Bodhi
follows.


INT.  VAN - DAY

The interior is empty except for several canvas duffel
bags and a small portable VCR.  It is one of the new sales
presentation models, with deck and monitor together in one
tiny unit.

                         UTAH
          What's this?

                         BODHI
          Insurance policy.  Now this is going
          to sting a bit, but it's for your
          own growth, brah.  Press play.

Utah hits the button and an image comes up on the tiny
screen.

TIGHT ON SCREEN.  A night shot.  Rosie the biker has Tyler
in a powerful grip.  Her hands are cuffed behind her, and
her mouth is taped.  He has his switchblade up to her
throat.  Her eyes are wild, but with rage, not fear.
She's trying to struggle out of his grip, kicking at him
viciously.
He controls her efficiently.
Bodhi stops the tape.

                         BODHI
          She's a wild one, isn't she...
          Special Agent Utah?

Utah lunges, pinning Bodhi to the wall of the van... an
elbow across his throat.

                         UTAH
          You're a fucking dead man--

                         BODHI
                  (gasping for breath)
          Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm
          the only one knows where they are.
          Just let me talk for a second.

Johnny pulls back.  Barely in control.

                         UTAH
          Talk.

                         BODHI
          She'll be fine, Rosie won't do
          anything.  At least not as long as I
          meet him at a certain place and time,
          about... let's see...
                  (he looks at his
                   dive Rolex)
          ... six hours from now.

Utah's voice sounds kind of strangled.

                         UTAH
          You call him... right now... and
          tell him to let her go.

                         BODHI
          Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on
          the road.  And where they're going
          there's no phones.  Damn, I hate
          this Johnny, I really do.  I hate
          violence.  See, that's why I need
          Rosie.  I could never make this
          thing work, myself.  No way I could
          hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man!
          She was my woman, once.  We shared
          time in this world.  But Rosie, he's
          kind of a... mechanism.  Once you
          set him in motion, he won't stop.
          That's his gift, a kind of...
          blankness.  Noon comes, straight up,
          he'll gut her like a pig and try not
          to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I
          can do, unless I get there.

Utah blanches as he takes this in.  Knows Bodhi well
enough now to know he means business.

                         BODHI
          So that makes us partners, doesn't
          it?  Because now we both have the
          same goal... to get me where I need
          to go.  Right?

Utah's expression turns suddenly cold as an executioner's.

                         UTAH
          We're wasting time.

                         BODHI
          See!  That's what I like about you,
          man!  You're just sharp as a razor
          blade.

Bodhi jumps out of the van and approaches the others,
gathered nearby.  He addresses the pilot first...

                         BODHI
          Get the plane down to Santa Monica
          and top up the tanks.
                  (to the others)
          Let's go.  Let's saddle up!

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  L.A. STREETS - DAY

A STYLIZED LONG LENS SHOT stacks the cars into a dreamlike
mirage.  The van weaves slowly among them with predatory
stealth.

                         BODHI (V.O.)
          Okay.  All I'm askin' for is ninety
          seconds of your life, Johnny.
          That's all.


INT.  VAN

EXTREME CLOSEUP ON the velcro straps of Second Chance
armor.  Tanned fingers cinch it tight.  A SHELL slides
into the cylinder of the Casull.  A SHOTGUN is cocked.
KACHACK!

                         BODHI
          It's basic dog psychology, brah.  If
          you scare them, get them pissing
          down their leg, they submit... you
          control them.  If you project
          weakness, you draw aggression...
          that's how people get hurt.

WIDER, revealing that Bodhi is in the back with Utah and
Roach.
Nathaniel and Grommet sit up front.
The duffels contents are strewn around.  Masks.  Weapons.
They're all pulling on suit pants and jackets.  Tying
ties.  Slipping on white gloves.  Snappy Oxfords.
Bodhi is pulling a suit jacket on over his BODY ARMOR.
Utah is fumbling with his armored vest.  He works with
vicious, jerky moves.  His jaw locked.  Eyes down.

                         BODHI
          Fear causes hesitation, and
          hesitation will cause your worst
          fears to come true.  You project
          strength to avoid conflict.

                         ROACH
          Peace through superior firepower,
          babe.

Bodhi conspicuously empties all the shells from a PUMP 12
GAUGE.
Pockets the shells.  Tosses the weapon to Utah.

                         BODHI
          Here, you need this.  You can't be
          comin' through that door with your
          dick in your hands, right?

                         UTAH
          I can't do this.

                         BODHI
          Sure you can!  You may even like
          it... it's a killer rush.  You'll
          see.  Hey, don't I show you things,
          Johnny U?

                         UTAH
          Bodhi, this is your wake up call,
          man -- I... am... an... Eff...
          Bee... Eye... Agent!!

                         BODHI
          Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a
          higher plane, you and I.  We make
          our own rules.  Why be a servant of
          the law Johnny U... when you can be
          it's master?

                         GROMMET
          Fuckin' A!

                         BODHI
          Ninety seconds, man, door to door.
          A small price to pay for someone who
          loves you.
                  (he looks up)
          She does you know.  It's not her
          style to fall so hard... I don't
          think she did with me.

He pulls the Ronald Reagan mask over his head smoothly.
Roach pulls his on.  NIXON.  Nathaniel becomes KENNEDY.
Grommet transforms into LBJ.
Bodhi looks in the bag -- no more masks.

                         BODHI
          Sorry, Johnny.  Guess you don't get
          to be president.

JOHNNY'S POV -- the back doors of the van.  And the
promise of what is beyond.  Bodhi enters FRAME.  Looks
straight at us.

                         BODHI
          Rock and roll!

BOOM -- THE DOORS bang open, REVEALING--


EXT.  STREET - BANK - DAY

STILL IN POV (HANDHELD) we hurl ourselves from the dark
van into blasting daylight.  Bodhi is ahead of us in the
sprint for the bank doors.  Dizzying forward momentum as
we hammer through the doors into--


INT.  BANK

THE HANDHELD POV CONTINUES as we follow Bodhi, a wolf
plunging among the sheep.  A FAT GUARD inside the doors.
He turns to us just as Bodhi butt-strokes him hard in the
gut.
Someone screams.

                         BODHI
          Everybody freeze!!  Don't move!!

AHEAD of us GROMMET/LBJ covers the SECOND GUARD with his
12 gauge.

                         GROMMET
          Don't fucking do it, man!

The guy has his hand on the grip of his pistol but it's
like the thing suddenly weighs eight tons, he can't seem
to lift it from the holster.  ROACH/NIXON slips up next to
him and helps him with it.  The guy is visibly trembling.

A YOUNG JOCK makes a move to run.
'OUR' SHOTGUN comes up like a reflex, right in his face.
Roach/Nixon throws the guy to the floor by his hair.
AHEAD OF US, Bodhi is in action.  Moving to the counter,
shouting--

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          All Tellers back away from the
          counter!  Hands on your heads!
          RIGHT NOW!!  That's right.  You know
          the drill.

It's like a replay of the robbery Utah saw on video.  But
he's right in the middle of it, like in some kind of
nightmare.

WE'RE STILL IN POV, the image WHIPPING wildly from side to
side as Utah scans the room.  We whirl dervish among the
statuary of the customers and bank employees.  Our gaze
drifts across THE FLOOR MANAGER, a short guy in a brown
suit standing with his hands clasped behind his back.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          All customers on the floor.  Let's
          go!  Move it!  Get down!  On the
          floor!  Right now!  Let's go.

Roach and Grommet are pushing them down.
Utah stands stiffly with the shotgun.  He seems dazed.
He catches the eye of a CUSTOMER.  In a tenth of a second
we see Johnny see the customer see his uncertainty.  Fear
has them both hyper-aware.
Johnny gestures fiercely with the shotgun.

                         UTAH
          On the floor, asshole!  What's your
          problem?!  I blow your fucking
          kneecaps out, you'll be on the
          floor!!

The guy hits the deck like a sack of cement.
BODHI/REAGAN floats beside Johnny, scanning with the
Casull.  He speaks without turning his head.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          Kick in the ass, ain't it?  Gonna be
          kinda hard to explain though... when
          they play the tapes back down at the
          bureau.  Could look bad on your
          monthly evaluation.

Johnny looks up at surveillance camera.  He's quite
fucked.

                         UTAH
          Can we just get the goddamn money
          and get out of here?!

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          That's the spirit!!
                  (to the room)
          Head's down!  Eyes down!  Just a
          couple minutes of your life and
          we're gone.

Bodhi leaps to the counter, commanding the room.
But at this point they diverge from their time-proven
plan.
Roach isn't going for the drawers... he's sprinting for
the VAULT.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          You!
                  (reading a name-tag)
          Miss Jennings... of New Accounts.
          Be a dear and open the inner gate
          for my associate.  NOW!!

                         MISS JENNINGS
          He -- he -- he has the keys.  Mr.
          Duggan.

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          Whatta say, Mr. Duggan?  Wanna give
          her the keys or do I pick through
          the blood and chunks for them?

DUGGAN, the bank manager, is surprisingly calm as he takes
the keys from his pocket.  Holds them out to the terrified
woman.

                         DUGGAN
          Do whatever they say, Terry.

MISS JENNINGS hurries to comply.
She unlocks the STEEL CAGE inside the big vault door.
Roach/Nixon and Grommet/LBJ take her inside with them.

A CUSTOMER, lying on the floor near the fat guard catches
his eye.
The guard, face jammed against the linoleum, blanches as
he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal
THE BUTT OF A PISTOL.  The customer mouths the words "I'm
a cop".
The guard is hyperventilating.

AT THE FRONT DOORS A WOMAN comes in out of the bright
sunlight.
JFK pulls her in fast and throws her to the floor.  Then
goes back to watching the street.

JOHNNY is next to Bodhi/Reagan.

                         UTAH
          You're blowing it, man!  You're
          breaking your own rules... pulling
          too much time!

                         BODHI/REAGAN
          JFK, how we doin'?

                         NATHANIEL/JFK
          All clear, man!

INSIDE THE VAULT Grommet and Roach are pillaging rapidly.
Their hands blur as nice fat STACKS OF 20s and 100s are
dumped into canvas sacks.

ON THE MAIN FLOOR the OFF DUTY COP slips his hands slowly
around the butt of his pistol, concealing the move with
his body.
He signals with his eyes to the fat guard, glancing at the
guard's ankle.

TIGHT ON THE GUARD'S ANKLE where we can see a sliver of
BACK-UP GUN, a tiny .25 auto in an ankle holster.
The guard's eyes are pleading with the hard-on cop.
"Don't make me do this".
The guy is sweating, shaking.  A yellow liquid spreads
across the tiles next to his quivering hips.  He's
actually pissing himself, he's so scared.

TIGHT ON the off-duty cop.  Watching like a ferret.  He
cocks his .38.
ECU GUARD'S EYES, wide with terror.

It happens like lightning.  The cop pops to his knees,
straight-arming the .38.  The guard goes for his ankle
holster.
REAGAN spins.
The cop FIRES.  BLAM!
Reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the
impact.
He crashes onto a desk on his back.  Slides off,
scattering papers.
A teller screams.  The cop spins toward Utah.
Johnny throws down the shotgun.  Shows his palms.  He's
holding out his gold star.

                         UTAH
          Federal agent!  Undercover!

The cop FIRES TWICE.  Two in the chest.  Utah is hurled
back.  Slams into the tellers' counter.

NATHANIEL/LBJ lets go with the 12 gauge.  BOOM!
The cop spins, hit by some 00 buck pellets.
The guard caps-off like a maniac.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM,
BLAM!!!
All of them wild, but serving to get Nathaniel pinned down
behind a check-writing island.

ROACH/NIXON LEAPS THE COUNTER and lands behind the guard.
The guard's shoulder explodes as Roach's 12 gauge
detonates.  He pitches onto his face, screaming and
holding the wreckage of his upper arm.
Grommet/LBJ is coming over the counter behind Roach as the
off-duty cop spins and fires.  BLAM!  BLAM!  Roach takes
it in the chest.  Staggers back, firing into the floor.
Trips and drops his shotgun.
Grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his
fingers.

IN SLOW MOTION Reagan's face rises above the counter.
The mask is askew.  In order to see, Bodhi pulls it off.
The Casull comes up in a slow, deliberate arc as--

THE COP turns, terrified now, whipping his gun around,
nightmarishly slow as--

BODHI COCKS THE CASULL in dream-time and--
KABOOOOM!!!  The world's most powerful handgun proves its
claim at 2000 feet per second.

A gout of hamburger explodes out of the cop's chest.
He is lifted off his feet.  Hits and slides across the
floor leaving a two-foot wide red smear.
Echoes slap the walls.  Then all is still.  Plaintive
whimpering and moaning.  The air is blue with smoke.

Johnny is trying to catch his breath.  He rips his shirt
open to see two deep indentations in the Second Chance
vest.  Flattened .38 slugs caught in the Kevlar mesh.  But
no blood.

Bodhi drops over the counter near Utah.
The two men look at each other.
Bodhi's eyes seem lost.  He stares around at the carnage
he has wrought, the bloody wreckage of his ego game.
His expression changes to something new -- truly crazed
now.  We feel that the madness which has been held in
check so long has been let off its leash.

                         BODHI
          Don't anybody fucking move!

Roach, clutching his side, moves to Grommet, who is on his
knees.
Beneath LBJ's stony countenance a river of blood flows
down Grommet's chest.  Roach pulls off the mask.
Revealing a terrified kid.
Grommet pulls his blood-drenched hand away from his
throat, stares at it bug-eyed.

                         GROMMET
          Oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all
          comin' out man, gotta stop it...
          it's all gonna come out... do
          something!!

He's trying to hold it in with his hands.  This doesn't
work.
A paste-white frightened kid.  Eighteen years old.
Suddenly realizing that this is not some video game.  That
death is real.
He slumps back, losing the battle for consciousness.
WE HEAR SIRENS APPROACHING.

                         ROACH
                  (freaking to Bodhi)
          We gotta bug out, man!  We're eatin'
          it bad on this one.  Let's go!

Bodhi reaches down and picks up Johnny's FBI shield off
the floor.
He considers it for a long time.  Then looks up at Johnny.
His eyes seem to ask for forgiveness...
A moment before he smashes the Casull into Johnny's skull.

JOHNNY'S POV, as he drops to his knees.  Everything going
dark as we see Bodhi's face distantly, his mouth moving
slowly...

                         BODHI
          Goodbye, Johnny.

The floor rushes up and smashes us in the face.
A view of shoes, running away from us, leaving bloody
footprints.  Then total darkness.

                                            CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  FIRST SECURITY BANK - LATER

Ten minutes later the bank "crime scene" is in full swing.
UNIFORM COPS are everywhere, trying to get statements from
sobbing witnesses.  HARP, MUNOZ, COLE AND PAPPAS represent
the FBI contingent.  Cole has one arm strapped to his body
in a fairly elaborate sling, and he moves slowly.

Harp is barking orders to everyone in sight.  Outside
(visible beyond the doors) it's total pandemonium, with
cops and ambulances, and of course a huge crowd of
rubberneckers.  A MINICAM CREW shows up.  Harp starts
shouting at them.

COLE, with evident pleasure, cinches down a pair of
handcuff's on Utah's wrists with his good hand.  Johnny
has a deep cut on his forehead, and the blood is trickling
into his eyes, but he seems not to notice.  Not to hear
MUNOZ speaking monotonously--

                         MUNOZ
          -- if you so desire, an attorney
          will be provided for you free of
          cost.  Do you understand these
          rights I have explained to you?
          Utah?

Pappas charges through the crowd, pushing Munoz aside.

                         PAPPAS
          He knows his goddamn rights!
                  (looks at Utah)
          Jesus, kid.  I knew you were getting
          too close to these guys.
                  (turns to the other
                   agents)
          Gimme the goddamn key to these
          things, Cole.  Christ!

He gestures to the cuffs still cutting into Johnny's
wrists.
Cole hands him the key.
Harp storms toward them.

                         HARP
          Don't take those off.  Just leave
          them on!  Your partner's an
          accessory to murder.  You realize
          that?

Harp spins Johnny by the shoulder to look at--
Paramedics carrying the covered body of the off-duty cop.
Beyond, still on the floor, is Grommet, his eyes staring
in death.
He was right about not making thirty.

                         HARP
          Three men dead.  One of them a cop.
          How's that sit in your gut, Utah?

                         UTAH
                  (cold and scary)
          Take your hand off my shoulder right
          now.

Harp pulls back instinctively.  Utah's eyes burn into him.
Looks like Johnny's not in the FBI anymore.

                         PAPPAS
          Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to
          the uniforms like some punk.  Let me
          ride him in.

                         HARP
          Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two
          screw-ups deserve each other.
          That's why I put you together in the
          first place.  Christ Pappas, you're
          as bad as he is... talk about the
          blind leading the blind--

Pappas steps close to the Supervising Agent.

                         PAPPAS
          Harp, let me tell you something.  I
          was an agent in this bureau when
          your mommy was still wiping your
          shinny pink ass, and you know one
          thing I learned in all those years
          that you still haven't?

                         HARP
          What that?

Angelo steps in with a roundhouse that has all of his 280
pounds behind it.
Harp's head snaps back, and he flops in a heap.

                         PAPPAS
          Respect your elders.
                  (he takes Utah by
                   the arm)
          Let's go kid.

Harp struggles to sit up, rubbing his jaw, as Pappas
stuffs Utah into his car.  Harp is so shocked he doesn't
say a word.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  PAPPAS' CAR

They drive for a couple of blocks in silence, side by
side.
Utah in disgrace.  Contrite.  Stony.  Finally...

                         UTAH
          I know where they're going.

                         PAPPAS
          Figured you did.

Angelo flips Johnny the key.
Johnny lets himself out of the cuffs.  He sits rubbing his
wrists.

                         UTAH
          Only problem is... we can't arrest
          them or shoot them.

ON PAPPAS' "what the fuck?!" expression we--

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  SANTA MONICA AIRPORT

LONG LENS SHOT through a forest of small planes as Pappas'
sedan glides INTO FRAME.  It moves sharklike among through
the Cessna forest.  Slows to a stop.
Through the jungle of wings and fuselages we see Pappas
get out of the car and start working his way among the
aircraft.
Utah slides behind the wheel and drives on.

TIGHT ON TURBOPROP ENGINE roaring as it warms up.
The same aircraft as before.
Bodhi and Nathaniel are loading duffel bags into the open
back door as the pilot completes his pre-flight checks.
The Ex-President's suits have been removed, along with the
body armor, and no guns are in sight.  Just a couple of
guys getting ready for a charter flight.  Bodhi looks up
and stops his work as...

THE FBI SEDAN stops about 50 feet away.
Nathaniel pulls a shotgun out of one of the duffels.
Utah gets out.  He holds his hands out from his body and
turns completely around.  Without his jacket on, it is
evident that he is not carrying a gun.
He walks forward.

                         UTAH
          I'm not armed.

                         BODHI
          But you're not alone.

                         UTAH
          Good guess.  There's a gun on you
          right now.

Bodhi feigns casual interest.  Looks around.  He can't
see...

PAPPAS nearby.  Moving cat-like behind a row of service
vehicles.  He gets his snubnose .38 propped on the bumper
of one, with a clear shot at Bodhi and Nathaniel.

                         UTAH
          Where's Roach?

                         BODHI
          Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in
          kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can
          I do for you?

                         UTAH
          You gotta tell me where she is.

                         BODHI
          And let my policy expire?  Sorry.

                         UTAH
          Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead.
          The ride is over.

                         BODHI
          I say when it's over!

                         UTAH
          The guy you killed was an off duty
          cop!  If you get out of here they'll
          nail you wherever you land.  They
          have a new thing called radar.
          Maybe you've heard of it.

Though he can't hear what's going on.  THE PILOT has
clocked the tension between the two men.  And the shotgun
in Nathaniel's hands.  He blanches, and starts to shut
down the plane's power.
By his reaction we see that he's obviously not in on it.

ROACH comes out of the hangar building nearby.  Neither
Utah nor Pappas see him.  But he sees Pappas drawn down on
Bodhi.  He drops quickly to one knee and opens the duffel
he was carrying.

TIGHT ON DUFFEL BAG, as it opens.  The pistol grip of a 12
gauge riot-gun sticks out of lots and lots of money.
Roach's hand slides the gun out slowly.

UTAH IS VERY CLOSE to Bodhi.

                         UTAH
          I know you man, when they fall on
          you, you won't back down.  They'll
          have to burn your ass to the ground.
          And I can't stop them... I'm the
          last person they're ready to listen
          to right now.  Thanks to you.

                         UTAH
          Shit may or may not happen.

                         UTAH
          Look, you got a death wish, you want
          to ride to glory... fine!  But don't
          take her with you, man.  I'm begging
          you... tell me where she is.  Then I
          walk away.  We've earned that much
          trust, haven't we?

The pilot opens the door and is climbing out when
Nathaniel wheels on him.  The pilot goes cross-eyed
staring down the muzzle of the 12 gauge, inches from his
face.

                         BODHI
                  (to the pilot)
          Back in the hotseat, campadre.
          NOW!

BEHIND THE TRUCKS, Pappas senses something.
His head snaps around.
Roach is behind him with the 12 gauge.  He FIRES.
Pappas hurls his weight sideways, as the buckshot punches
into the truck fender.  Some of it catches Pappas in the
hip.  He hits the ground hard and whips up the .38 BAM!
BAM!  BAM!
Roach flips onto his back.
The shotgun blows a hole in the sky as he hits the deck.
Pappas is on the ground, totally exposed, 20 feet from the
others.

NATHANIEL fires once, wild.  Terrified.  His shot blows a
divot out of the asphalt next to Pappas.
He pumps the slide, chambering another round.
Then Pappas' fourth and fifth rounds drill into him.
He slams back against the Cessna's fuselage.
Slides down.  Two red smears on the white aircraft.
Bodhi lunges for the fallen 12 gauge.
Pappas takes aim.  One round left.
Utah sprints between them.

                         UTAH
          Angelo!  Don't fire!

                         PAPPAS
          Kid, get outta the way!!

                         UTAH
          NOOO!!

Utah is blocking Bodhi with his body.
Bodhi's fingers are poised, frozen, a few inches from the
shotgun.
Standoff.

                         PAPPAS
          GODDAMMIT!!

He snaps the pistol up, aimed at the sky.
Pappas stands panting.  Enraged and frustrated.  Pain
searing his leg.  Everything is tense and electrified.
BOOM!!  Pappas' chest EXPLODES with a spray of blood!

BEHIND HIM, ROACH is lying on one elbow in a pool of
scarlet.
He cocks another round into the chamber and fires again.
BOOM!

Angelo drops to his knees, holding his ruined body like
he's hugging himself.  Johnny lunges toward him, his face
distorted with shock.

                         UTAH
          NNNOOOOOO!!!

Angelo's eyes meet his for a moment.
In his dilated pupils is the great question.
Then he slumps forward and lies very still.
The breath leaves his body and doesn't go back in.

Johnny moves toward his friend in a daze.  Drops to one
knee beside him.
Roach aims the shotgun at him, coughing blood.
Utah doesn't notice.  Or is beyond caring.
Bodhi holds his hand up in a gesture like a benediction.
Roach's finger relaxes on the trigger.

Utah puts his hand on Angelo's white crewcut hair.
He hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as
Bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge.

Roach is working himself to his knees.  His breath is
sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the
customary breathing orifices.  Bodhi crosses to him and
helps him up.  He covers Utah with the shot gun as he
half-carries Roach to the plane.  The pilot is white with
shock.  He'd run if he could remember how.

                         PILOT
          I ain't flyin' you guys to San
          Phillipe man, forget it.  Not now--

                         BODHI
          Thanks for telling the nice FBI
          agent where we're going.

Roach works his way up into the plane.  He waves the
shotgun at the pilot, his face a vicious, blood-flecked
mask.

                         ROACH
          Get in the fucking plane.

Bodhi stands behind Johnny, the shotgun aimed at his head.
Their expressions are lethally cold.
We see that Utah hates this man who was his friend, his
teacher, more now than he dreamed it was possible to hate.

                         BODHI
          We're gonna ride this out, all the
          way, Johnny.  You and me.  Let's go.

Johnny nods slowly, as if accepting that this was all
somehow pre-ordained, and that they both knew the game
would take them this far and beyond.  He stands and walks
to the plane.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MEXICO - DAY

THE SCREEN EXPLODES WITH A BLUR OF MOTION.
POV of the ground racing below us at 180 mph.

REVERSE, preceding the plane as it rockets through barren
canyons.
As close to the earth as the terrified pilot will take it.
Under the radar.


INT.  PLANE

The aircraft bucks like a bull as the pilot jinks and
banks wildly.
Bodhi has the Casull aimed at the base of his skull from
the jump seat just behind him.
Roach holds the shotgun on Utah, seated across from him in
the rear seats.
Roach is a pale, sweaty mask.  He is propped against a
bulkhead, seemingly collapsed in on himself like a
discarded coat.
His entire shirtfront and lap are slick with blood.
But his gaze is steady, and the shotgun is aimed into
Utah's guts.
No one talks or moves on this grim hell-ride.


EXT.  ARROYO

Near noon.  The sun blisters a landscape out of time.
The white Cessna rockets above the saguaros, its shadow
pumping up and down over the broken terrain like some
manic alter ego below it.  It WOOSHES over us, raising
dust devils.


INT.  PLANE

The pilot yells over his shoulder to Bodhi...

                         PILOT
          Look, we been in Mexico the last
          half hour... can I quit mowing the
          lawn here or what?  I'm getting more
          brush in the wheels than I usually
          like, you know what I'm saying?!

                         BODHI
          Yeah, get some height.  Take her up
          to eight thousand on this heading.

The pilot pulls back on the yoke and the plane climbs.
Bodhi moves back next to Roach, who's fading.

                         ROACH
          We're gonna pop up on their screens.

                         BODHI
          Doesn't matter now.  We're almost
          there, man.  Here, let me help you
          get your gear on.

Bodhi drags a parachute pack up onto the seat next to
Roach and starts helping him into the harness.  Roach
keeps the shot gun pointed at Johnny.

                         ROACH
          I'm cold.

                         BODHI
          You're gonna be fine.  Just fine.
          Johnny, toss me that money bag will
          you.  Easy does it.

Utah hefts the duffel.  Weighs its contents, and their
price.

                         UTAH
          You're cold because all the blood is
          running out of your body, Roach.
          You're going to be dead soon.
                  (he tosses the bag)
          I hope it was worth it.

Roach clutches the canvas sack to his chest like a Teddy
bear.  Glares at Utah.  He hooks the strap of the duffel
over one shoulder.

                         BODHI
          Hey, Johnny's just trying to psych
          you man, forget it.  Just keep
          thinking about all those senoritas
          nursin' you back to health.  Come
          on, amigo, let's get you set for the
          jump.

Bodhi props Roach next to the open door and takes a
walkie-talkie from the seat, keying it.

                         BODHI
          Rosie, Rosie, this is Air Force One,
          do you copy, over?

A burst of static is followed by a surprisingly clear
voice.

                         ROSIE (V.O.)
          Copy you, Air Force One.  We have a
          visual on you.  Lookin' fine.

                         UTAH
          Tell him to release Tyler.

                         BODHI
          Why should I?

                         UTAH
          What if your chute fails, Bodhi?
          Rescind the order.  Let her off the
          hook, she's served her purpose.  Do
          it, man, you owe me that much.  Let
          me hear it before you check out.

Bodhi meets his eyes and considers for a couple of
seconds, then keys the walkie.

                         BODHI
          Rosie, listen carefully.  Surgery
          is canceled, is that clear?  Repeat
          it back to me.

                         ROSIE (V.O.)
          Copy you.  Surgery is canceled.
          I'm lettin' the bitch go.

Bodhi looks out the doorway.  Gauging distance, airspeed,
the geography below.  He looks at Utah, aiming the Casull
at him.
Johnny stares back at him like a pit viper.

                         BODHI
          I know it's hard for you Johnny.
          You want me so bad it's like acid in
          your mouth.  But not his time.
                  (he braces Roach at
                   the door)
          Let's go.

Bodhi signals the pilot and Utah feels the plane drop as
the engines are cut back to an idle.  Bodhi slaps Roach on
the shoulder and Roach slumps backward out of the plane.
Bodhi braces to jump, looking at Johnny for a last split-
second.

                         BODHI
          You lose, campadre.

He chucks the Casull onto the seat beside the door and
bails.
Bodhi tumbles out into space.  It's over.

Utah's knuckles are white, gripping the seat.  There's a
dynamo, spinning out of control in his head.  He leaps up
in an explosion of rage and drives his fists into a
bulkhead.  Looks around like a rabid animal.  TWO SECONDS.
THREE SECONDS.  Then...

                         UTAH
          FUCK IT!!!

Utah grabs the Casull off the seat and dives out of the
plane.


EXT.  PLANE

UTAH, WITHOUT A PARACHUTE, but carrying a very large gun,
rockets downward.  He presses his arms to his sides and
falls head-down, building speed.

Three hundred feet below him is Bodhi, freefalling in a
spread-eagle position.  Utah moves his feet and hands,
angling toward him.
Bodhi doesn't see him.  Falling flat, he tops out at
terminal velocity for that position.  130 mph.

Utah slashes downward at 160 mph.  The gap between them
closes.
Utah is almost blinded by the windstream.  His eyes burn.
His lips are peeled back by the blasting air.
Bodhi is eighty feet below him... 4000 feet to terra
firma.
Utah focuses all his incredible will and concentration.
He's only going to have one shot at this.
Bodhi is right below him.
Utah is closing like a SAM missile.
He trims a little, and...
WHAM!  Slams into Bodhi in a mid-air tackle.

Bodhi's eyes are wide with amazement as they tumble
together.
Utah has made the grab and locked his arms around Bodhi in
an iron grip.
He pulls the Casull's muzzle up to Bodhi's head and
screams in his face.

                         UTAH
          Pull the parachute!!

Bodhi looks at the gun.  Looks at Utah.  Grins wildly.

                         BODHI
          Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for
          you.  Why don't you pull it?

                         UTAH
          No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord!
          Now!!

                         BODHI
          Naw, you pull it!

Utah looks down.  The earth is rushing at them.  2500
feet.

                         BODHI
          Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you
          gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?!
          You use your other hand what you
          gonna hold on with?

                         UTAH
          Pull it right now or I'll blow your
          fucking head off and pull it myself!

                         BODHI
          Well that's the only way it's gonna
          happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you
          want to do it.  You're gonna die,
          Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...

1000 feet.  The ground is close enough to see details.
Cactus, sagebrush.  They rocket past the bright yellow
canopy of Roach's chute a hundred feet away.

                         UTAH
          You fucking crazy!?  Pull it!!

They're right in each other's faces.  Taking it way beyond
the edge.
Bodhi's eyes are wild.  A gleeful, adrenalized madness...
his pupils are the entrance to Hell.

                         BODHI
          Three seconds... two... one...

                         UTAH
          SHIT!!

Utah flings the Casull away and pulls the rip-cord so hard
he almost loses his grip anyway.  POOM!  The canopy cracks
out.
Full and round and bright red.
The ground roars at us.
WHAP!  Utah and Bodhi hit.  Hard.

They slide and tumble down the slope of an arroyo in a
cloud of dust.
Rocks and debris clatter into silence.

NEARBY Roach hits the ground limp as a rag doll.
He moves listlessly as his chute lines tug at him but his
eyes stare without blinking right at the sun.  Next to him
the money satchel's contents are spilled right into the
sand.  Roach's lifeless hands lie limp among the bills
that caper in the desert wind.

UTAH AND BODHI are both completely still as the dust
clears.  Finally they groan and stir.  Necks move, hands
move, legs move.  Bodhi rolls to his knees.  He is cut and
scraped, the blood running bright down his dust-covered
skin.

Utah looks around, blinking.
Surreal that he should be plopped down here in the red-hot
Mexican desert.
Bodhi staggers to his feet and grins at him.

                         BODHI
          Wild ride, huh?

                         UTAH
                  (gasping)
          Jesus Christ, Bodhi!

Utah tries to rise and -- grabs his knee in agony.  We see
by his mask of pain that it's totaled inside.

                         BODHI
          That pesky knee, huh?  Too bad.

He looks up at the sound of an engine.

BODHI'S POV of his big four-by roaring toward us with a
meteor tail of dust.  It slides to a stop next to them.
Rosie gets out of the driver's side and stands calmly with
a sawed-off over his shoulder.

Utah blinks through his sweat and pain at--

TYLER running toward him out of the dust.  She kneels next
to him and puts her arms around him.  Bodhi limps to the
truck.  Through the swirling dust we see him look back.

                         BODHI
          You had me worried there, for a
          second, Johnny U.

He swings up into the four-by and guns the engine.  Rosie
hops into the shotgun seat and the truck hurls up
roostertails as it tears out across the desert toward
Roach's billowing gravemarker.

Johnny touches Tyler's face tenderly, leaving a smear of
blood.
He gives her a wan version of the Johnny Utah grin.

HOLD ON the truck moving off in a heat-shimmered cloud of
dust, becoming a mirage, then a memory as we--

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

AN ENORMOUS WAVE which FILLS FRAME, seeming to rise
endlessly before thundering down in a holocaust of spray.


EXT.  BEACH DAY - DAY

An unfamiliar beach laid waste by monster waves under a
storm sky.
Wind whips sand across the narrow beach-road, throwing it
against the front doors of the LIGHTHOUSE PUB.
TITLE OVER: ONE YEAR LATER...


INT.  LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY

Dark.  Almost empty.  A snarling crocodile head is mounted
above a tapper of Guinness Stout.  A Koala bear with
plastic eyes holds a Foster's.  A BARTENDER with leathered
skin washes glasses.
At the bar, a single disheveled customer... human
driftwood.
GUST OF WIND blows open a shuttered window.
The bartender moves to close it.

                         BARTENDER
          Gonna close early today, mate, 'fore
          the bloody storm hits.

JOHNNY UTAH swivels toward CAMERA.  His tanned face is
barely recognizable, jaws hidden underneath a slight
beard, long bleach-out hair swept behind an ear.  His
muscular shoulders pop from a sleeveless football jersey.
The man seems deadly focused.

                         UTAH
          Storm's already here... It's
          bringing me the swell.

Johnny stares into his drink.
ANOTHER BLAST OF COLD as the front door opens.
Johnny turns at the sound.
TYLER takes a step inside.  Her hair is different, more
bleached out, frazzled from the sun.  Her eyes adjust to
the dark room.

                         TYLER
          John, they're here.

Utah downs the drink and slides off his stool.  He has a
pronounced limps as he crosses to Tyler at the door.
They exit into daylight under an old wooden sign which
reads: LIGHTHOUSE PUB - BELL'S BEACH, AUSTRALIA

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  LIGHTHOUSE PUB - DAY

UTAH and TYLER walk out onto the roadway as several
Australian Police cars converge on them.  A dozen
uniformed OFFICERS step out.  The ranking officer, a
fortyish LIEUTENANT, walks up to Utah.

                         LIEUTENANT
          D'you see him, Mr. Utah?

                         UTAH
          No.  But he's here.

                         LIEUTENANT
          Now, look, I know you used to be a
          federal agent up in the states and
          all that, but you're a citizen now,
          so just find him and we'll handle it
          from there.

                         UTAH
          No problem.  Just give me a couple
          minutes with him first.

Johnny limps out across the huge expanse of sand alone.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  BELL'S BEACH - AUSTRALIA - DAY

WALL OF SOLID WATER FIVE STORIES HIGH CRASHES straight
down in a holocaust of spray...
Rising up from the ocean to meet a tormented sky, roll the
most terrifying waves any surfer has ever seen.  They
close out, pummeling the ocean floor, casting a shockwave
up the shore.
SURFERS gather on the sand, gaze out to sea.

                         1ST SURFER
          Jesus Almighty, the bloody sand's
          shakin'.

The beach sounds like a MORTAR RANGE.
JOHNNY passes among the brahs.

                         2ND SURFER
          Totally closed-out.  It's fuckin'
          death on a stick.

ON BODHI, sitting crosslegged in the sand, arms folded
around his knees.  He stares pensively out at the waves.
His hand reaches out and absently strokes a surfboard
lying next to him.

                         UTAH (V.O.)
          I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty
          year storm, Bodhi.

Bodhi smiles, the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates
the cunning of his opponent.  Utah sits beside his prey
and stares at the ocean.  Bodhi stares with glittering
eyes at the heaving ocean before him, face splitting into
that feral, death's head grin.

                         BODHI
          And I always knew I could count on
          you, Agent Utah.

                         UTAH
          I'm not FBI anymore.

                         BODHI
          You never were...

                         UTAH
          I asked them to give me a couple
          minutes...

Utah calmly glances over his shoulder.
Bodhi follows Johnny's gaze to the cops watching from the
road.

                         BODHI
          It went bad, brah.  Real bad.
                  (smiles inwardly)
          I just felt it was time...

A BOOMING ROAR sounds from the ocean.
Bodhi just stares at the waves, with awe and perhaps fear.

                         BODHI
          Time to dance with the universe.
                  (he turns to Utah)
          I could never handle a jail cell.
          You'll do this for me, won't you
          Johnny?  Haven't I earned this
          much?

Utah doesn't move to stop him as he stands, hefting the
longboard.
He half smiles, then turns toward the water, and starts
walking.
He stops.  Turns around.

                         BODHI
          Thanks, brah.

Bodhi doesn't wait for a reply.  He walks to the water's
edge, and never looks back.  He throws his board into the
foam and paddles, the riptide pulling him out.  The
monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the
trough of the holocaust.

UTAH stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver
final justice.  The cops are running clumsily across the
sand, too late to stop Bodhi.  Tyler steps up behind
Johnny, and puts her hands on his shoulders.

BODHI is nothing more than a SPECK as he shoots across the
lip of the colossal wave, carving the board downward -- AN
UNTHINKABLE FOREHAND BLAST sends him into a 180 degree
slide straight down the enormous face, eyes wild, his
mouth opens in a soundless howl -- Bodhi and the outer-
limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious
moment in perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect
union... There is no fear in his face, only awe as the
mountain of water closes out, burying the Bodhisattva in a
whitewater grave... Pieces of broken surfboard explode
upward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and
vanish.

UTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf.
Tyler lowers her head.  A fragment of surfboard washes up
onto wet sand.  The wind gathers force.
Johnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around her
shoulder, gathering her close.  Tears are streaming down
her face as she stares at the sea.

                         UTAH
          He rode it all the way.

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP, rising high above their heads as
the liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the
Australian shore...

          PONTIAC
           is parked at the curb. It waits.

          INT. PONTIAC - "RED" HAMILTON ( 34)

           looks at his watch. With his meticulously parted red hair, he
           might be a bank president. It's 6:55 a.m.

          HAMILTON
          Time.
          Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER is in the backseat. He
          nods. His arms are behind him. We don't know why. Red starts
          the car and drives forward.

          CONVICTS
          Its cold.-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed.
          This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair,
          broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression
          has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's
          nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz,
          Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line.

          PRISON GUARDS
          in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam
          Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line,
          poised to unleash violence.

          AMONG THE HARD MEN ARE...
          HARRY "PETE" PIERPONT (32), 6 foot 1 with eerie blue eyes.
           Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority.
          CHARLES MAKLEY ( 44), squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars
           and as calm as Pierpont is volatile.
          HOMER VAN METER (27), tall, an incorrigible clown and an
          unemotional killer. He has continued to ridicule guards even
          when it cost him months in the hole.

          watches through a window as a Pontiac pulls into the parking
          area in front of the prison across from the streetcar tracks.
          Hamilton jerks a handcuffed Dillinger out of the backseat.
          Dillinger is shoved forward. Hamilton's wearing a star.

          TURNKEY
          (opening up)
          Afternoon.
          Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an
          adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a
          barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks
          behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have
          entered. Meanwhile...

          BOXES
          and bolts of fabric wait for the convicts. lam. A KLAXON
          sounds. Door opens. Convicts enter. Walter Dietrich goes
          right to the stacks and pulls a box with an "X" crayoned on
          the side. Its labeled "Thread."
          (Dietrich was mentored by Herbert K. Lamm, an ex-Prussian
          soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying
          military tactics and who rode with Butch & Sundanc4's Hole in
          the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on
          Lamm's techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..'ohn
          Herbert Dillinger.)

          DIETRICH + "THREAD" BOX
           arrive at a busy work station with Pierpont, Makley and Van
          Meter. Under spools are four Colt 45 automatics with loaded
          magazines.

          GUARD DAINARD
           is approached by Pierpont, who shoves the 45 in his face.

           PIERPONT
           Line up! Line up...
           Dietrich and Van Meter control THREE OTHER GUARDS. ED SHOUSE,
           JIM LESLIE and EARL ADAMS - three other Cons armed with
           makeshift clubs and spivs -- join the escape. Meanwhile...

          Didn't you get paroled out of here a few

          DILLINGER
          Yes, sir. Three months ago.

          TURNKEY
          . John... Johnnie Dillinger?

          DILLINGER
          That's right. But my friends call me
          "Johnnie". You gotta address me as
          "Mister" Dillinger.
          Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see
          Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his
          head and swing it onto the Two Guards...

          RED/DILLINGER
          Against the wall! Hands up! Get up!
          Dillinger's cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the
          stunned pokerÂ°players. Hamilton and Dillinger are as tight as
          they come.- They share their food, money, liquor, ammunition
          and women. ,.id right now...

          YARD GATE
          is keyed open by Dainard followed by Pierpont and Makley and

          DILLINGER
          at the window checks the escape route to the Pontiac. Its
          clear.
          Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out. Smooth. He
          crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so

          again, caving it in.

          snaps the butt across Shouse's face. Breaks Shouse's
          cheekbone. Dillinger pulls back and slams the heavy butt dead

          rifle with a slim forestock and wrist and a turned-down bolt

          HE IS MELVIN PURVIS (30)
          cleancut and handsome. A square jaw. Chester Gould modelled
          Dick Tracy's profile after Purvis. Has not big, but he's

           A few .45s splinter nearby branches. Fultz, Baum and Barton
           seek cover: Purvis works the bolt and chambers another round.

          Purvis kneels onto his right knee. On his upraised left knee
          he braces hi left elbow. He inhales. Starts a smooth
          squeeze. Ha Tway through the exhale he FIRES. Floyd's right
          arm flies up. He's punched forward and crashes to the ground.

          Grover stands and flattens against the back wall, as if
          trying to permeate the masonry and disappear into the back
          alley.
          Dillinger peels him off the wall and steers him towards the
          vault.

          control the people outside the bank. His 351 Winchester
          rifle is hidden by his coat. Crowds gather across th' street
          because of the alarm. Homer's focused. He is rock steady.

          MANLEY
          is at the tellers' drawers. His job is to shovel cash into a
          canvas bag. The Tellers stand aside.

          at the vault with Weyland. Weyland hesitates. Dillinger's
          right hand with the Thompson covers Tellers so Makley can
          work. His left hand draws one of the two 45s he keeps in
          twin shoulder holsters and he cracks Grover Weyland across
          the forehead. He aims the .45 between Weyland's eyes...

          street. ONE stays low and runs towards Homer.

          INT. BANK - BOYARD

          marches into the lobby, gun in hand.

          BOYARD

          PIERPONT, behind him, slams the butt of the Thompson into the
          back of his head, knocking him flat, and disarms him. He
          rouses. Pete doesn't like authority. Pete hits him again.
          Blood pools onto the floor.
          A WOMAN faints, collapsing. Peters dead calm. He looks over
          the half-painted windows. The growing crowd on the sidewalk
          is getting too large...

          Angry Cop rushes him. Homer slams him in the gut with his
          rifle, disarms him and uses him as a shield. He backs to the
          front door. Pedestrians flee. Cops draw down. They cannot
          shoot without Homer blowing off the Cop's head. Meanwhile...

          INT. BANK -- DILLINGER

          tosses the last bag to Pierpont at the front door. On. the way

          air. Cash on the counter.

          DILLINGER
          That your money there, mister?

          FARMER

          Well, go ahead and put it away. We're

          They scatter.

          Everyone's good.
          (leans in; they talk quietly)
          We been looking to snatch two fellas.
          One's a St. Paul banker, Ed Bremer. Need
          a few more hands.

          DILLINGER
          Don't like kidnapping.

          KARPIS
          Robbing banks is getting tougher.

          DILLINGER
          The public don't like kidnappers.

          KARPIS
          Who gives a damn what the public likes?

          DILLINGER
          I do. I hide out among them.

          KARPIS

          .: yeah, then you, Ma, Dock and Freddie
          hole up like hermits on farms for six
          months. I grew up on a goddamn farm. I
          hate farms. I like big cities, crowds and
          a good time...

          Well, we got a mail train we been lookin'
          at, too.

          DILLINGER
          Say, by the way, if someone got pinched
          here, who can get'em out real fast?

          KARPIS
          Lawyer named Piquett. We all use him.
          (writes a phone number)

          DILLINGER
          What about this train?..

          KARPIS
          Needs two, three more months to set up. I
          need seven or eight real right guys to
          take it down.

          A million seven, a million eight.
          Dillinger looks at Karpis. In 2007, that would be $22
          million.

          KARPIS (CONT' D)
          Federal Reserve shipment. It runs only
          twice a month. This is the kind of score
          you go away on after.

          DILLINGER
          Where you gonna go?

          KARPIS
          Brazil. Cuba, maybe. What about you?

          DILLINGER
          Were having too good a time today. We
          ain't worryin' about tomorrow yet...

          KARPIS
          You ought to. What we're doin' here,
          don't last forever.
          They lock at each other: two pros at the top of their game.

          DILLINGER
          Keep me in mind on the train.
          Karpis leaves. Dellinger can't see Billie anymore.

          (LOUDER)
          Know how much they made snatchin' that
          Hamm Brewery guy? $250,000.
          Dillinger looks at Pierpont.

          Shut your yap, Homer.

          HAMILTON
          (reading his mind)
          He's okay.

          DILLINGER
          Three rules I learned from Walter
          Dietrich. One: never work with people who
          are desperate. Two: never work with
          people who aren't the best. Three: never
          work when you're not ready.
          Billie reappears, dancing with a young man.

          HAMILTON
          Well, I got rule four: stay away from
          women.

          DILLINGER
          Without women, I might as well have
          `stayed in stir.
          Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.

          HAMILTON
          What's why they invented whores.
          (getting up)
          Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his
          eye on Billie. Music ends. Young man escorts her to her
          table. He tries to join her. She turns him down.
          Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how
          beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect
          build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger
          straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing
          about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous.
          He gives her his best grin.

          DILLINGER
          I don't know what you said to your
          friend, but I sure am glad you did.
          Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a
          great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but
          he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of
          experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something
          back.

          DILLINGER (CONT'B)
          Is that French?

          BILLIE
          On my father's side. There's an "e" at
          the end. Do you have a name?

          DILLINGER
          Jack Harris.
          Music changes to "Bye Bye Blackbird."

          BILLIE
          Do you dance, Jack?

          DILLINGER
          I don't know how.
          She smiles a pretty smile at him.

          BILLIE
          How come you don't know how to dance?
          Its easy. Follow me. This is a two-step.
          (he stares at her feet)
          Don't look at my feet. Look at my
          shoulders.
          She stays an inch or two distant in his arms. Its slow and
          languorous. He follows her with little difficulty. He can
          smell the perfume in her black hair.

          They look into each other's eyes. He pulls her closer, wants
          to kiss her long smooth neck. He almost can't resist...
          Their lips are an inch apart. And then she rests her cheek on
          his shoulder and the kiss that wasn't hangs in the air around
          them. He whispers...

          He's cool. He returns the look. They look away.

          Then he turns and he kisses her hard on the lips. She didn't
          expect that. Her eyes are wide. He opens and wraps her in his
          overcoat, their bodies close to each other.
          She kisses him back, long and deep. And she didn't expect to
          do that, either.
          At last they separate.. .and look at each other for a beat.

          MAY MINCZELES
          Sounds good to me.
          Dillinger has eyes only for Billie.

          DILLINGER
          You ran out on me.

          BILLIE
          `you left me standing alone on the
          sidewalk.

          DILLINGER
          I 'you're going to be my girl, you have
          swear you'll never do that again.

          BILLIE
          I'm not your girl!
          A CUSTOMER comes up and puts his ticket on the counter.

          CUSTOMER
          Brown overcoat.

          BILLIE
          (ignoring customer)
          I am not your girl and I'm not going to
          say that.

          DILLINGER
          I'm waiting.

          CUSTOMER
          So am I.

          DILLINGER.
          (to Billie)
          "I am not ever going to run out on you
          again." Say it.

          BILLIE
          No.

          DILLINGER
          Well, I will never run out on you. And
          that's a promise.

          CUSTOMER
          Well, I want to run out of here. So,
          lady, will you get my coat...?
          Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor and slams him
          into the wall. Real jailhouse rage. The lethally cold eyes
          tells the customer everything he needs to know. Dillinger
          swings him to the counter, grabs the man's ticket, slams thru
          the half door, finds the man's coat, tosses it at him...

          DILLINGER
          Keep the tip.
          (to Billie)
          You ain't getting other people's hats and
          coats no more either.
          He takes her coat and holds it for her. She doesn't move.

          BILLIE
          No one's ever done that for me before.

          DILLINGER
          You're with me now.

          BILLIE
          I don't know anything about you.

          DILLINGER
          I was raised on a farm in Mooresville,
          Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My
          daddy beat the hell out of me because he
          didn't know no better way to raise me. I
          used to do dumb things but I'm a lot
          smarter now. I like baseball, movies,
          good clothes, fast cars, and you. What
          else do you need to know?
          She gets into her coat. Dillinger opens the door for her.
          They exit, watched by May.

          two drinks.

          BILLIE
          You been living here long?

          DILLINGER
          Yeah. Since yesterday.
          From a back bedroom (Red's) a phonograph is louder as a door
          opens and Red enters the kitchen in a robe for a drink. He
          returns. Laughter. Dillinger has the boxes and drinks.

          DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          I got something for you.

          (BEAT)
          What's wrong? Open it up.
          Billie opens the boxes. She lifts out a sleeveless dress in
          dusty pink. It is beautiful. She is very touched. The second
          has a coat with a fur color. But still...

          BILLIE
          I'm drinking in a man's apartment who
          .:W.ants to romance me. Okay. I'm no
          "Pollyanna, but there are things that you

          DILLINGER
          We`rob banks `cause banks is where they
          keep the money. I can make 500 dollars in
          a year or I can make ten thousand dollars
          in a morning. I'll take my chances on the
          bank. No apologies. We don't go lookin'
          to hurt anybody. But if somebody gets in
          our way, that's gotta be their problem.
          That what you want to know?

          BILLIE
          I'm trying to get to know you.

          DILLINGER
          You want to get to know me?

          INT. APARTMENT, DILLINGER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dillinger is an uninhibited and enthusiastic lover. They
          pause.
          He falls over onto his back and pulls her onto his chest and
          they look up out the window through the upside down elm trees
          to the Chicago moon in the cold sky.

          most beautiful creature he's ever seen. She's looking at his
          stuff.
          She sees suitcases that are packed, ready to leave in a
          heartbeat. Everything's so neat. She touches his folded
          shirt...

          DILLINGER
          Always are. Ready to get up and go in a
          heartbeat...
          She stands next to him in the bed now. He pulls her down next
          to him.. She turns her good ear towards him.

           DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          What's wrong with the other ear?

          BILLIE
          I was married once. He was too handy with
          his fists.
          She stares at Dillinger. Will this put him off.

          DILLINGER
          Where's he now?

          BILLIE
          In prison. I divorced him. Only mistake I
          made was marrying him in the first place.
          He got caught mugging a mailman...

          After my daddy died, we went to live on

          Flandreau nothin' ever happened.

          (BEAT)
          When I was 13, we went to live with my

          Frances had a lot of Indian friends who
          went around to churches and put on plays
          like "Little Fireface." And nothing
          exciting ever happened to me there,
          either. So I haven't been anywhere or
          done anything in my whole life except
          come to Chicago and try to make my way.

          DILLINGER
          Well baby-you're going to start a new
          and exciting kind of life from right now.
          And as they're pulled to each other and start making love
          again, she stops...

          BILLIE
          heat do you want?

          DILLINGER
          To please you.
          That's not what she meant, but gently, he rolls her over on
          the bed.
          A smile spreads slowly across her lips.

          Men go in and out at night carrying heavy

          quickly cross the alley from the back stairs to the Desoto.
          And Nelson immediately lays down rounds in careful short
          BLASTS of full auto. Tommy Carroll calmly, smoothly starts
          the DeSoto. Nelson's barrage punches into the wall, drives
          Daum to cover.

          slams open a window. The DeSoto accelerates out of the alley.
          Purvis FIRES a few rounds. Baum FIRES his pistol. Both are

          Without qualified help I would have to

          has pulled into track 16. THREE MEN stand out among--,-
          passengers. One's face is obscured by a wide brirmdd`hat.
          They are --

          CHARLES WINSTEAD, CLARENCE HURT + GERRY CAMPBELL
          Stiff from the journey, they stretch, take in the crowd.
          Winstead is in his mid 40s, 5 foot 8, body out of steel
          cable. Hurt is in his late 30s. These men are ex-Texas
          Rangers. Unlike flashier Texan lawmen of the period, they do
          not wear Western wear unless they're on a horse. That's for
          drugstore cowboys out to impress Easterners. They wear dark
          suits and ties and hats. They have "special qualifications."

          WINSTEAD
          What'd he say he looked like?

          HURT
          Didn't say.
          Their suitcases have been set on the platform. A PORTER
          approaches.

          PORTER
          Gentlemen need a hand?

          Winstead gestures at their bags and one case. The PORTER goes
          to lift the case. It is so heavy he can barely raise it.
          Campbell picks up the other end. They toss it on the cartâ

          PORTER (CONTÂ°D)
          Hardware salesmen?

          WINSTEAD
          That's right.
          His terse reply makes the garrulous porter stop talking.

          INT. UNION STATION, GREAT HALL - DAY

          The Neoclassical hall is enormous. Still no Purvis.

          CAMPBELL
          I'll call.

          HURT
          I'm going to the men's room.
          Winstead spots a shoe-shine stand. Winstead sits, nods and
          the SHOE SHINE MAN begins to polish his Western boots. He's
          startled bi:the knife in a sheath built into the right boot.

          WINSTEAD
          Wcrk around it.
          From under the brim of his hat, Winstead glances at big city
          life in Union Station. He's an ominous presence.

          NITTI

          Yeah, Frank.

          NITTI
          Ever since those pricks shot me I can't

          What?

          PHIL D' ANDREA
          Some friends from Chicago in the
          stands...
          D'Andrea nods. John Dillinger nods back. Nitti glances at
          them; glances away.
          Dillinger has on sunglasses. Billie is wearing a straw hat.
          They are shouting to the greyhounds along with Pierpont,
          Homer and Makley and some girls. They have tall drinks. This
          is the good life for the privileged few in the middle of the
          Depression.
          A dog wins; not theirs. It calms down...

          Billie doesn't laugh. Dillinger pulls her close and she can't
          resist his good spirits.
          D'Andrea's approached...

          PHIL D'ANDREA
          How d'ya like the track? C'mon to the

          Whatever these boys want, its on the

          He leaves. Pierpont, Makley and Homer go off to place new
          bets. Billie looks at Dillinger. Looks away. Dillinger
          catches her...

          DILLINGER
          What?
          She is quiet for a moment.

          BILLIE
          Thank you, thank you for these last few
          weeks. I never thought I'd see Florida.

          BILLIE
          It's been, three, four weeks. You'll look
          for a change. Or you'll get tired of me.
          And then I'll be sad and angry. So I
          wanted to say thank you before then...
          Dillinger is surprised that her expectations are so low. She
          didn't think his interest in her to be more than passing.

          DILLINGER
          You want to leave?

          BILLIE
          No. But I'm no fool. I'll be back
          checking coats at the Steuben Club.

          DILLINGER
          Well, I don't want you to leave. So it
          won't be that way.

          BILLIE
          Then it will be another way that's worse.

          (BEAT)
          You rob banks and you run rings around

          WILLIE
          Well, goddamn it, you don't need a

          Homer what...?

          Homer and his damn joke... I don't want
          to be around to see any of that. Okay?!
          That's what it's about... Dillinger gets it.

          DILLINGER
          I am not going anywhere! I am going to
          die in your arms as an old man when that
          time comes. So what do you say about
          that?

          CLOSE ON BILLIE

          A new pack of dogs are about to take flight.

          A fresh and tanned Dillinger and Billie are in a strikingly
          modern gas station on Route 66. Billie helps out a family by
          taking their picture with a Kodak Brownie in front of a
          Saguaro cactus. Snow-capped Rincon mountains are behind them.
          She leans down to play with the round baby. She looks over at

          Get in here.
          She stretches out and wets her hair. She sits up to reach for
          the shampoo. Dillinger's got it and rubs it into her hair.
          Dillinger hears something in the street. He goes to the
          window and sees a car parked irregularly. TWO MEN get out.

          DILLINGER
          Get dressed. Right now.
          He turns and runs into...

          Dillinger falls to his knees. Clerk hits him twice more.
          Billie rushes into the room.. She's naked. The two men from
          the street haul Dillinger, bloody and semi-conscious, to his
          feet and throw him against the wall and cuff him.

          Deputies stifle laughter. Dillinger comes up close to Purvis.

          Newspaper said you found him alive. It's

          Dellinger looks at the crowd. Per the "Chicago Daily News
          "His diction was amazing - better in many instances than that
          of his interviewers -- his poise no less so... There Was no
          hint of hardness about him, no evidence save in the alert
          presence of armed policemen that he had spent his formative
          years in a penitentiary. He had none of the sneer of-the
          criminal... Looking at him for the first time.,.heIates as
          the most amazing specimen of his kind ever seen outside of

          atmosphere of prejudice? The very air

          Can't stay here no more, Mr. Johnny.
          The smile falls off Dillinger's face.

          DILLINGER
          Says who?

          INT. KITCHEN - MARTIN ZARKOVICH

          makes himself visible in the doorway. Unseen are two big cops
          with shotguns who stay hidden inside.

          ZARKOVICH
          (moves into doorway)
          Sport's only following orders. So am I.
          He demonstrates that his palms are empty. He's smart enough
          not to be armed.

          ZARKOVICH (CONT'D)
          They thought you might come here.
          Zarkovich is nervous. Dillinger reaches for his front pocket.

          ZARKOVICH (CONT ` D )
          Your money is no good.

          DILLINGER
          I don't get it.

          ZARKOVICH
          You go talk to your pal, Gilbert.

          DILLINGER
          About what?

          ZARKOVICH
          Talk to Gilbert Catena.
          Dillinger, not taking his eyes off windows and doors, backs
          away. He knows there are more men. Zarkovich is nervous and
          frozen because...

          RED HAMILTON'S
          front sight rests on Zarkovich's heart which he would blow
          out the back of his chest with the souped-up 351 Winchester.
          Now, Dillinger pulls the '34 Ford out of the backyard with
          Red still on the running board. Zarkovich almost faints in
          relief.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BRICK STREET IN KANKAKEE, ILLINOIS - THE '34 FORD - DAY

          pulls to the curb. Weeds. Vestiges of prairie. An old house
          sits at the back of a lot. A workshop is near the road. A
          sign says 'ï¿½Lieboldt Repair."

          DILLINGER
          We're looking for Oscar...is he home?

          MRS. LIEBOLDT
          I'm Mrs. Lieboldt. And he ain't home.
          He's dead.
          Johnny glances at Red.

          DILLINGER
          I sure am sorry, ma'am. Was it an.
          accident?

          MRS. LIEBOLDT
          He accidentally got in the way of a
          shotgun when it was going off. What do
          you want?

          DILLINGER
          Oscar had "tools" of mine, he was
          repairing them.

          took it all away. It ain't here no more.

          CUT TO:

          INT. KEDSIE AVENUE CIGAR STORE - GLASS DOOR

          slams open. Dillinger and Red enter. Red throws two customers
          outside, closes the door, flips the sign to CLOSED. Dillinger
          confronts Gilbert Catena with a 45 pulled from one of two
          shoulder holsters and dead centered on Gilbert's forehead.

          DILLINGER
          I went to East Chicago to lay low. The
          welcome mat was not out. And I kept
          hearing your name.

          (BEAT)
          Then at Oscar's, my gear is gone.
          The deadly look in Dillinger's eyes leaves no mistake.

          DILLINGER (CONTÂ°D)
          I am going to ask you once.

          (BEAT)
          And I just did.

          GILBERT
          Let me make a telephone call.
          Dillinger nods.

          Gimme Phil...

          (BEAT)
          He's downstairs.
          He hangs up. He gestures to a doorway and stairs leading to
          the second floor. Johnny and Red throw Gilbert up the stairs
          first.

          INT. SECOND FLOOR - GILBERT, DILLINGER + RED - DAY

          enter. They see office remodeling in progress. FIVE
          TECHNICIANS run wires, installing phones. EIGHT CLERKS with
          shades on and ledgers man phones. Other men are looking over
          blueprints. They look up. They are Jake Guzik and his
          brother, Phil D'Andrea and seven or eight assorted Syndicate
          soldiers.

          open their coats to allow the search.

          D'ANDREA
          (irritated; to Catena)
          Anybody see him come in?

          GILBERT
          I don't think so.
          SOLDIER ONE. Dillinger turns the man, slams a knee into his
           kidney, pulls him back off balance, holds him up with one 45
          under his jaw, as he draws the second 45 and sweeps the
          group...

          DILLINGER
          Wanna know if we're armed? Were armed.
          He dumps this guy on his ass, his heavy shoe an ounce from
          crushing his larynx. Red's two Thompsons concealed on
          shoulder straps are out from under his coat. Frozen time.
          Phil D'Andrea sits on the corner of a table. Only he stays
          relaxed.

          D'ANDREA
          k around, Johnny. What do you see?

          1 1 DILLINGER
          A`lot of telephones.

          D'ANDREA
          You see money. Before last month there
          were independent wire services letting
          bookies know who won the third race at
          Sportman's Park. 300 of 'em. Now there's
          only one. Ours. General News. Nationwide.
          On October20, you robbed the bank in
          Green Castle, Indiana. You got away with
          $74,802. Split 5 ways, that's $14,960.40.
          You probably thought that was a big
          score.
          Dillinger stares at him. Where's this going?

          D'ANDREA (CONT'D)
          (indicates the room)
          This room makes that much every day. That
          is how money gets made. And it keeps
          getting made, day after day after day. It
          is a river of money. Flowing right to us.
          And it gets deeper and it gets wider.

          That's right. We pay them not to. Unless
          they know you're here. Then they come
          through the door, no matter what.

          (BEAT)
          What does that tell you?

          DILLINGER
          I'm popular.

          D'ANDREA
          You're bad for business.
          What this is, is called obsolescence.

          D'ANDREA (CONT'D)
          So the Syndicate got a new policy,

          D'ANDREA (CONT'D)
          You need something to tide you by in case
          you're short?
          Dillinger and Red's looks say it all. They start out.

          D'ANDREA (CONT'D)
          Okay-but can you do me a personal
          favor?
          Dillinger hesitates.

          DILLINGER
          Where in the hell's all the big money?

          OUTSIDE THE BANK
          A traffic cop, ROGER POWERS, runs up. Van Meter surprises and
          disarms him in classical fashion, but...

          LOBBY
          Through the window Carroll sees a motorcycle cop, HALE KEITH,
          arrive outside. Nelson scrambles onto a desk and FIRES a
          burst through the plate glass.

          BABY FACE NELSON
          I got one, I got one! I got a cop!

          VAULT - ON DILLINGER
          can't believe this is fucking HAPPENING.

          EXT. THE SECURITY NATIONAL BANK & TRUST COMPANY

          Dillinger and Hamilton emerge with the Bank President, FOUR
          TELLERS for a scrum of hostages. Carroll and Nelson,,:.,have a
          ragtag bunch. They're almost at the car. Nelson turns to the
          onlookers.

          NELSON
          What are you looking at?
          Nelson FIRES over their heads. Hostages scream and try to
          break loose. Nelson advances on the crowd...
          Out of a JEWELRY STORE, HARRY BERG, emerges and fires at BABY
          FACE NELSON, who is wearing a bullet-proof vest. Nelson
          sprays the area. Berg dives back in his store, BYSTANDER,
          JACOB SOLOMON, is hit in the stomach and crumples. Delay
          allows...

          CONTINUED:
          He squeezes off a ROUND. The shot hits Dillinger in the back
          of the left shoulder and exits his upper arm.

          DILLINGER
          Son of a bitch!

          BANG!
          The second shot hits Carroll in the head, knocking off his
          hat. Dillinger fires up at the DEPUTY, tries to lift Carroll,
          blood gushes from his head. He appears to be dead. Dillinger
          leaves him.
          Sixteen year old, JOE PAWLOWSKI -- fueled by adrenaline, runs
          across the street and jumps onto Nelson's back. Nelson,
          screaming with rage, throws him through a plate glass window,
          FIRES two rounds and runs to join the others -- PURE CHAOS.
          Dillinger throws Nelson in the car.

          THE HUDSON
          surges forward. The car proceeds to an intersection and
          stops.

           DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          m.on!
          Shouse cant find his place on the.git.

          HAMILTON

          As Shouse makes the turn...

          INT. FORD, TRAVELLING - DILLINGER

           grimaces with pain. Hamilton helps him off with his overcoat.

          pulls in. Its a tourist lodge -a two-story log cabin with a
          bar, kitchen and dance floor downstairs and bedrooms above.
          EMIL WANATKA, comes out, trailed by his two collies and
          Nelson's girlfriend, Vi Scott.

          DILLINGER
          How'd you find this place?
          Dillinger looks at Wanetka. He's uneasy. He trusts nothing
          about it.

          Couple of Chicago guys told Tommy. Don't

          were salesmen.

          being counted.

          DILLINGER
          How much?
          Nobody wants to answer. Hamilton meanwhile uses Atropine
          sulphate to clean Dillinger's wound.

          BABY FACE NELSON

          $46,120.

          DILLINGER
          That would be less than $800,000, right?
          Right!

          VAN METER
          Still more than $8,000 a man.

          DILLINGER
          Leave my money and get out.
          Van Meter, Nelson and Shouse exit.

          DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          We gotta cut loose from Nelson.

          HAMILTON
          You need to rest up awhile.

          DILLINGER
          No. We don't get out of here in the
          morning, we're going to wind up dead.

          HAMILTON
          We could head to Reno...
          Dillinger lies back in bed, looks around the room, angry and
          frustrated. Hamilton gets up to leave...

          DILLINGER
          I need two more guns, Red.
          OVER we HEAR the SOUND OF SOMEONE SCREAMING and CALLING OUT --

          INT. SIOUX FALLS HOSPITAL - TOMMY CARROLL - NIGHT

          in the bed, his head swathed in bandages. He lapses in and
          out of consciousness, thrashes with pain, shouting out.

          WERE ACUTELY AWARE OF PURVIS.
          Uncomfortable, Purvis stands apart from the others. Agents
          Rorer and Clegg are by the bedside.

          CARROLL
          Gimme the shot, Doc. Please. I'm begging
          you.

          RORER
          Not until you tell us!
          As the pressure inside his skull becomes unbearable --

          CARROLL
          Oh, Mother! Help me! Please, God!
          He begins to scream. It is harrowing. A DOCTOR hurries into
          the room, Purvis blocks him from the patient. He shoves him
          back out the door and follows him...

          DOCTOR
          (spits it out, fury)
          T h e bullet entered the back of his head.
          It is resting over his right eye. His
          brain is swelling. He will be dead soon.
          He is suffering and I need to sedate him.

          PURVIS
          Not yet. If you interfere, I'll arrest
          you.
          From inside.

          RORER
          Where is he?!

          CARROLL
          Give me a shot!

          RORER
          Di.llinger! Then you get the shot! Where
          is he?
          The Doctor looks at Purvis. Purvis remains steadfast. But we
          see Purvis struggling with this. Maybe his soul has just gone
          to hell.

          Rorer hovers over Tommy Carroll. He blocks our view but his
          hands press down onto Carroll's skull. Screaming.
          The Doctor walks away. He will not be a witness to torture.
          More screaming.
          CLOSE ON PURVIS: looks up to see Rorer looking at him. Rorer
          is sweating. He nods. He has an answer.

          EXT. PINE WOODS - TWO BUREAU HIRE CARS - NIGHT

          approach the lodge and stop 300 yards away. No lights.
          Purvis, Baum., Winstead, Hurt and Agents Rice and Rorer get
          out and whisper:

          PURVIS
          If you can get Dillinger alive, do it. If
          not, then you put him down. Rice, Rorer -
          take the back. Carter, you cut through
          the woods and come up on the front from
          the northwest. Get up close enough to see
          if they're in the barroom.

          WINSTEAD
          If he is?

          PURVIS
          We know where he is. We go in.

          WINSTEAD
          If he isn't?

          PURVIS
          o in anyway.

          WINSTEAD
          Too much real estate out here. Too many
          ways for'em to get out. And too few of us
          to blockade 'em in.

          (BEAT)
          We need road-blocks. An assault plan.
          This ain't how to do it. We gotta wait
          for Cowley's group...
          Purvis hesitates. Then.

          PURVIS
          I will not risk them escaping and
          humiliating us. Take the southwest
          corner. Cover that and the front.
          (to Hurt)
          Block the road we came up --
          Winstead has to accept this. He is not happy.
          Baum moves off through the woods. As Winstead and Hurt start
          to move off...

          enter from the barroom. They seem relieved to be away from
          the garrulous Nelson. They get into the Chevrolet and start
          the engine. Turn on the radio. Loud. Collies begin to bark.

          at Dillinger's window, exchange furious fire with Rice and
          Rorer at the side of the lodge, forcing them back behind out
          buildings. Splinters fly. Glass shatters. Gunsmoke is thick.

          EXT. LITTLE BOHEMIA, BARROOM - NELSON, SHOUSE + VAN METER

          fire back, forcing Purvis to cover.

          PURVIS
          Where the hell is Cowley?
          Purvis - low - runs to the Chevrolet, opens the door. The
          driver and one passenger are dead. A middle aged, unarmed man
          steps out. Bullets zing around him. He promptly sits down on
          the ground.,, dead drunk. These are not Public Enemies.

          THE TEXANS
          UNLOAD only on real targets. Bullets CUT through the trees.

          SHADOWY FIGURE
          darts from a side door and leaps over the porch FIRING a
          Tommy gun. Bullets strike the trees around Purvis.

          BAUM
          Someone got out!

          PURVIS
          Is it Dillinger?

          BAUM
          I think so.

          PURVIS
          See if you can head him off. Go!
          Purvis runs into the woods after the fleeing figure. Carter
          Baum races off in a car.

          INT. LITTLE BOHEMIA, SECOND STORY - ROOF - DARK NIGHT

          Bullets TEAR into the wooden walls. Two Men jump out of a
          back window, not clear who they are... Its chaos.

          EXT. LITTLE BOHEMIA - THE TWO MEN

          sprint down wooden steps to the beach, turn LEFT and run
          along the lake behind the lodge, trading SHOTS with Rorer and
          Rice. Rice is hit in the leg and cartwheels forward. Rorer
          stays with him.

          NOW WE SEE THIS IS DILLINGER
          running but impeded by his shoulder wound. Hamilton helps
          him. In the background, we SEE Van Meter and Shouse have also
          bailed out of the house for the beach but disappear into
          woods to the RIGHT.

          DILLINGER + HAMILTON
          run along the line of the lake, but in woods now.

          WINSTEAD
          runs through trees parallel to them but further away from the
          water. He catches sight of two figures through the :trees
          playing against the water from 100 yards away.

          DILLINGER + HAMILTON
          move fast. Not much brush to slow them. Dillinger senses,
          reacts...

          HARD CHARGING WINSTEAD,
          from 50 yards FIRES his pump-action 10 gauge shotgun FOUR

          TIMES.

          DILLINGER + RED
          in a burst of speed, cover behind heavier trees, which are
          cratered by the heavy shot. And Dillinger, never stopping,

          Winstead should be...

          DILLINGER'S POV: NOTHING
          Winstead's gone. And Dillinger knows the level of play has
          been raised by the addition of whoever these men are. As he
          and Red race across the ravine for the high ground
          advantage...

          HURT FIRES
          Hamilton's legs give way. Dillinger hauls him up, still on

          DILLINGER
          You hit, Red?

          HAMILTON
          I don't think so.
          Dillinger looks at Red's shirt. A blood stain blooms just
          above his belt. It's bad.

          tumbles down the bank onto the road. Nelson flags it down an

          Three slugs tear into Baum's neck.

          EXT. DILLINGER FARM (MOORESVILLE, INDIANA) - SOMEHOW JOHN


          DILLINGER - DAY
          sits in plain view on a chair. His Thompson rests against the
          wall. His sister, Audrey, is giving him a haircut. His
          father, John Wilson Dillinger, drinks coffee next to him. The
          January sunlight is so direct, it's like Spring.

          DILLINGER
          Not too short on the sides.

          BILLIE
          comes out the door. Dillinger's niece comes up with a Kodak
          Brownie.

          CONTINUED:

          NIECE
          Can we take a picture?

          DILLINGER
          Of course.
          (to nephew, approaching)
          You got an eye on those federal boys?

          NEPHEW
          Yes sir. They're over having breakfast at
          Myra's Diner. They've been hanging
          around, here, doing nothing for so long,
          they just know this is the last place
          you're going to show...

          CLOSER: BILLIE
           watches Johnny. This is who he would be if he had not had the
           troubles in this life, a charismatic young man.

          EXT. FIELD - BILLIE + DILLINGER SR. - LATER

          walk through winter wheat.

          BILLIE
          That how he was when he was a boy?
          Carefree and laughing...?

          JOHN SR.
          Not right when his mother died. But afterâ-
          awhile, yes.

          BILLIE
          You love him, don't you?
          She touches his arm. He looks back at the house.

          JOHN SR.
          He grew up a motherless child... After he
          was there he never had a woman's comfort.
          So I loved him but didn't know how to
          raise him. And that's the truth.

          (PAUSE)
          When he come out of that prison, he had
          so many worries. Restless. Bitter. He had
          a desire to get even.
          A covey of quail flush out of the wheat.

          JOHN SR. (CONT'D)
          Well, now he has gotten even. And he has
          seen the country. And he has you. So, he
          is carefree.

          But what is next for you and Johnnie?

          BILLIE
          To try to live somewhere else.

          JOHN SR.
          (knows more)
          Well, if it goes okay, good. Whatever
          happens, he has been my boy. And I have
          loved him in my heart, always. Right or
          wrong, no matter what.
          He is as straight and truthful as the land is flat. She takes
          his hand and they walk through the fields.

          DILLINGER

          keys.
          They drive north over the Clark Street Bridge. Dillinger
          gives her an envelope.

           DILLINGER (CONT'D)
          5,000 dollars. It buys us a month, but
           we're not staying that long.

          EXT. AUSTIN STATE TAVERN - 416 NORTH STATE STREET -


          DI.LLINGER'S CAR - DAY
          pulls to the curb on the east side of the street. Billie gets
          out, walks through the crowds, down the sidewalk and crosses
          the street to the bar. MOVE IN on the sign. This is the
          location we saw being tapped at the Telephone Exchange.

          OVER DILLINGER'S SHOULDER
          watching the distant front of the tavern into which Billie
          disappeared. Then...

          flooding into the Austin State Tavern from the other side.

          is shocked. Frozen. Inside...

          INT. AUSTIN STATE TAVERN - REINECKE

          REINECKE

          (SHOUTS)
          Who brought you? How'd you get here?

          BILLIE
          .I took a taxi.

          EXT. TAVERN - REINECKE + MADALA LEADING OUT BILLIE

          There's20 of them, now. She's totally surrounded.

           INT. HUDSON - DILLINGER

           races around the block. Comes up on the same side of the
           street as the tavern behind the Federal cars.

           THE THOMPSON
           in his lap. He checks his 45.

           HE SEES.. .HER
          There she is. Where's an opening? His eyes dart.

          MORE CHICAGO POLICE
          arrive. It's now a sea of blue.

          CLOSER: DILLINGER
          20-30 men surround her.

          BILLIE
          .hauled towards a Bureau car by Reinecke. He tips her off
          balance. He bounces her off the door pillar on purpose.
          Dillinger sees all this.

          DILLINGER
          can do nothing. Tears of frustrated rage stream down his
          face. Later, he would say he "cried like a baby."

          EXT. STATE STREET -- DILLINGER + THE HUDSON

          are waved away, irritatedly, by uniformed Chicago police
          trying to clear traffic. Dillinger's Hudson drives off into
          the distance.

          INT. BANKER'S BUILDING - BILLIE - NIGHT

          under a bare lightbulb.

          REINECKE
          If you tell us all about him, maybe
          you'll get a break. Maybe you end up
          doing a couple of months on a work farm.,
          like a girls' home or something.

          ANOTHER AGENT
          Where is he? Where were you meeting?
          Where were you hiding out?

          REINECKE
          ...or we drop you in a black hole. And you
          et to shit and piss on the floor and
          then lie in it all night in the dark with
          the bugs and the rats.
          Billie's eve'lids fall. She drifts off. Reinecke kicks her
          awake.

          REINECKE (CONT'D)

          (SHOUTS)
          Where is he?!
          Billie startles! CLOSER on her chair.

          BILLIE
          I have to...
          He kicks the chair again. She's being denied a toilet. The
          humiliation is part of the pressure. Billie's embarrassed.
          Billie urinates on the chair now and the floor. Another Agent
          makes a face...

          OTHER AGENT
          What was that movie, "Squaw Girl"...?
          Reinecke has gone out to get water for himself.

          INT. OUTER OFFICE - REINECKE

           drinks from a water cooler. In the background are a dozen
           agents with Tommy guns in every corner as if Public Enemy
          Number 1 will assault at any moment.

          REINECKE
          Lady, you're stinking up my office. Where
          were you supposed to meet him!
          He slaps her. Billie's shoulders collapse.

          REINECKE (CONT'D)
          I can't hear you.

          BILLIE
          (nods, very low...)
          We were supposed to meet...at our
          apartment...

          REINECKE
          Where?

          BILLIE
           On Addison. 1148...

           REINECKE
           When?

           BILLIE

          INT. 1148 W. ADDISION, APARTMENT - WIDE ON DOOR - DAWN

          Its shot off its hinges. A half-dozen AGENTS invac e.'One gun
          goes off. Everybody is about to open up until they realize
          its one of theirs.

          REVERSE: THE APARTMENT INTERIOR
          It is dead empty. Reinecke looks at the dust on the floor. No
          one's been here for a month.

          CUT TO:

          INT. COOK COUNTY JAIL .- PURVIS

          walks past holding cell with assorted informants, hookers,
          family members. As he passes one we HOLD ON...

          INT. CELL - PROBASCO

          in a metal chair, hands at his side handcuffed to the floor.
          He shouts. A large man slams him across the abdomen with a
          lead-filled sap. Another agent waits indifferently.

          INT. WOMEN'S SECTION - DRUNK TANK - PURVIS

          enters and crosses through...he can't help but SEE.

          PURVIS POV: LIANE HAMILTON
          Hamilton's sister, 17, stares vacantly from the corner.
          Bruised, filthy, dress ripped, she's among a sordid group of
          30 older women: tough hookers, drunks, a couple of tough
          dykes in men's lace-up boots. Liane catches Purvis' eyes.
          He walks on...

          INT. B OF I OFFICE, INTERROGATION ROOM - REINECKE'S

          furious. He walks up to Billie, handcuffed, and slaps her
          across the face, two, three times. Hard. Her ear, her nose
          bleeds. He almost knocks her out.

          REINECKE
          Where is he!

          BILLIE
          (low voice)
          Well...
          (rising strength)
          he's way the hell away from here by
          ,Tow, isn't he?
          She looks up at him. And she drops the little girl act. She
          sent them on a wild goose chase to give her man time to get
          away.

          BILLIE (CONT'D)

          (CALM)
          You wanted to know where he is, you dumb
          flatfoot? You were too scared to look
          around. You walked right past him on
          State Street. He was at the curb in that
          black Hudson.

          (BEAT)
          You asked me "how I got there?" I told
          you I took a taxi. And you believed me?

          (LAUGHS)
          He dropped me off and was waiting for me.
          And you walked right past him.
          He's furious. Her Native American beauty doesn't soften
          Reinecke. He visualizes smashing the bones in her face with
          his fist.

          DOLORES
          Mr. Purvis, you have to stop this. Those
          men cannot abuse a woman in that way.
          Purvis, with Winstead following, moves to the interrogation
          room.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - BILLIE


          BILLIE

          .and when my Johnny finds out how you
          slapped around his girl? You know what
          will happen to you, fatboy?
          She looks Reinecke square in the eye. Reinecke swings...

          WINSTEAD
          grabs his wrist, turns him, Reinecke resists, Winstead nearly
          breaks his wrist.

          WINSTEAD
          Bad idea.

          PURVIS
          Uncuff her.
          Reinecke tries to pull away. He can't. The smaller man is
          built of steel cable.
          Rorer uncuffs Billie.

          PURVIS (CONT'D)
          Restroom's down the hall.
          Billie tries to rise. Stumbles.

          BILLIE
          I can't stand utp.
          Purvis doesn't hesitate. He picks her up in his arms and
          carries her through the office to the restroom in the
          corridor. She puts her hand over her eyes in embarrassment.

          PURVIS
          Miss Rogers...
          Doris Rogers follows them.

          her I'm coming for her. I'll get her out.

          PROBASCO
          You need a car? A place to stay? Wanna
          stay here?
          Is Probasco is trying to lure Dillinger here?

          ANNA SAGE
          Immigration say they send me back to
          Romania.
           Zarkovich, the crooked cop, takes Anna's hand. The 40 year

           ZARKOVICH
          You know what to do.
           He turns her chin so that her eyes look right into his.

           ZARKOVICH (CONT'D)

          you stay in America.

          ANNA SAGE
          No good.

          That's all there is.

          ANNA SAGE

          never.

          PURVIS
          I will not guarantee what Immigration
          will do. What I can guarantee is what I
          will do. If you do not cooperate, you
          will be on a boat out of this country in
          48 hours. Do not play games with me.

          BILLIE (V.0.)
          Don't try and break me out. I am too well
          guarded. Milan Prison is too tough. Two
          years is not a long time, anyway. Go

          THREE FIGURES BRUSH PAST HIM. A woman's orange skirt. Its
          Anna Sage, Polly Hamilton, and John Dillinger. They sweep to

          JOHN DILLINGER. LOOKING UP AT THE SCREEN.
          In this Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and
          effect operates on the end, as inescapably as gravity. It's a
          core truth. This is the only end for Blackie Gallagher. And
          its as true for john Dillinger in his life as it is for
          Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time
          be up.
          Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration
          slices time into component parts. Gable exchanges last good-
          byes. He warns his D.A. friend, Ronald Coleman, not to
          commute his sentence. The images play on Dillinger's face.
          They take him over-alone in the packed theater while 25
          Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside.

          They pass doorways. Reinecke approaches from 20 feet behind.

          ACROSS THE STREET: ZARKOVICH
          looks up... sees Dillinger walking away. If Dillinger's taken

          Hurt crosses the sidewalk in front of Dillinger and walks
          north. He'll turn and position himself behind Dillinger on
          the right. These guys are pros.

          him. Purvis is ten steps behind Dillinger, on the left close
          to the wall. Now Purvis reaches for his gun.

          ECU: REINECKE
          draws his weapon. He stares at the back of Dillinger's head.
          Has getting closer. Sweat runs into Reinecke's eyes. This
          isn't the firing range with a paper target. This isn't
          theory. This is the beast. The beast is a gunfighter. The
          beast is better than you. You beat-up his girl. Your shot
          will miss...

          DILLINGER IN LARGE PROFILE
          now passerWinstead in the doorway. Purvis is raising his 9mm
          Browning. Reinecke stalls. He doesn't want to be first.

          WINSTEAD
          steps out f, the doorway, now, and falls in up the center of
          the sidewalk. Reinecke's eyes are riveted on Dillinger...

          AND JOHN DILLINGER
          senses something.

          REAR SHOT: DILLINGER'S NECK + HEAD IN SLO-MOTION
          Subconsciously his brain processes what his peripheral vision
          took in that his intuitive defenses don't like about this
          landscape. He turns...

          DILLINGER SEES REINECKE
          Reinecke's hand holding the gun is frozen in the air. He's
          paralyzed. He lacks the power to pull the trigger.

          DILLINGER'S EYES
          There's the man who slammed Billie into that car. Dillinger's
          lethal intent focuses on this one target. In milliseconds...

          turning towards Reinecke. Reinecke has hijacked his
          attention. Dillinger hasn't picked up the others.

          PURVIS
          pulls the trigger. Nothing. He left the safety on. He fumbles
          with it.

          PURVIS
          H--halt!

          DILLINGER
          sees all of them RIGHT NOW. He pushes the .380 in SLOWED TIME
           towards Purvis.. .and bumps into a pedestrian named Ella
          Natasky.

          ELLA NATASKY
          starts to fall. Dillinger turns his attention to her for a
          millisecond. He's a gentleman. His impulse is to reach for
          her to steady her...

          CHARLES WINSTEAD
          shoves aside the paralyzed Reinecke, pushes past Purvis,
          leans forward and shoots John Dillinger in the back of the
          head. The heavy 45 round punches through Dillinger's,brain
          stem and exits underneath his right eye.
          John Dillinger stumbles into the alley opening and starts to
          fall. A second shot from Winstead and two more from Clarence
          Hurt hit him now. They don't matter.

          JOHN DILLINGER
          falls through the air.

          EXTREMELY CLOSE ACROSS THE COBBLESTONES: JOHN DILLINGER'S

          FACE
          crashes into the FRAME. One lens of his eyeglasses breaks.
          The brim of his straw hat snaps. The hat falls away. He
          struggles, but can't move. He breathes. He tries to speak..

          WINSTEAD
          stands over him. Purvis snatches the .380 automatic out of
          Dillinger's hand.

          .WINSTEAD
          sees Dillinger's trying to say something.

          Only Charles Winstead hears the rest.

          PURVIS
          unloads Dillinger's gun. His gun-handling of Dillinger's gun
          is a lot better than his gun-handling of his own under
          stress.

          PURVIS
          What did he say?

          WINSTEAD
          I couldn't hear him.

          PURVIS
          You look after this. I need to call

          to focus not at all.

          EXT. CANAL STREET HOTEL - DOOR

          opens. Alvin Karpis comes out. In the hot, humid New Orleans
          air, his suit coat is off...he carries it under his arm. He
          crosses the street towards his Lincoln Coupe. His eyes land
          on a man on a bench across the street looking at him over a
          newspaper. And while crossing the street, Alvin slows down.

          THE MAN IS CHARLES WINSTEAD
          The newspaper hides a sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever
          action shotgun.

          ALVIN LOOKS TO HIS LEFT: CLARENCE HURT
          leans on a lamp post. His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle.

          NOW ALVIN KARPIS
          freezes. He doesn't hesitate. He opens his hands to
          demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his jacket; fall to
          the ground. He knows instantly who they are and that.,,they
          intend to kill him. Karpis' eyes dart to the roofto isÂ°.
          Snipers on both. In this instant, Karpis knows he is done.
          One objective races into his mind: stay alive.

          KARPIS'
          stretches out his arms, wide. Winstead has dropped the
          newspaper. The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at
          Alvin's chest. Karpis is displaying he is unarmed. Winstead
          approaches warily step-by-step. His weapon would cut Alvin in
          half. Clarence, the rifle at his shoulder, inches forward.
          The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters with real trigger-time have
          taken Alvin Karpis.

          = eier arrest today. Karpis reached for a
          rzf le, but the Director was too fast.

          CUT TO:

          INT. CLYDE TOLSON'S OUTER OFFICE - MELVIN PURVIS - DAY

          waits. It looks like he's been waiting for awhile. People who
          pass act as if he is invisible. They look right through him.

          TOLSON
          The Director will see you now.

          INT. HOOVER'S OFFICE - HOOVER - DAY

          Purvis stands in front of the desk. On the right of the desk
          is a plaster death mask of John Dillinger.

          HOOVER
          (without looking up)
          Agent Purvis.

          PURVIS
          Yes sir.

          HOOVER
          (sees Purvis stare at death

          MASK)

          (MORE)

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          130.

          CONTINUED:

          HOOVER (CONT'D)
          A medical student in the morgue made that
          cast of Dillinger's face. It's a reminder
          of the war we continue to wage against
          the punks and hoodlums...
          Purvis looks at Hoover. This was the golden boy who Hoover
          came to despise.

          PURVIS
          One thing I learned was that John
          Dillinger was an outlaw and my Adversary.
          But he was no punk. And he was no
          hoodlum.

          (BEAT)
          Another is that I have no future in your
          Bureau. And I don't desire one. I quit.
          Purvis tosses his badge on Hoover's desk and walks out.
          Hoover couldn't care less.

          INT. MILAN WOMEN'S PRISON - GRANITE WALL - DAY

          PAN LEFT and fall EXTREMELY CLOSELY onto the face of Charles
          Winstead. He waits.

          WIDER - WINSTEA.D
          is in an interview cell.

          INT. CELL BLOCK - TRACKING A WOMAN'S FEET

          in prison issue shoes down the cellblock corridor. ARM UP. It
          is Billie Frechette. She walks with two guards behind her.

          INT. INTERVIEW CELL - DOOR OPENS

          Billie enters. She's surprised to see Winstead.

          WINSTEAD
          How are you doing, Billie?

          BILLIE

          (SITS)
          If you come here to ask me more damned
          questions. "Where's this one or that one?
          Did I know Vern Miller? Who did what...?"
          Winstead shakes his head no.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          

          131.

          CONTINUED:

          WINSTEAD
          I didn't come here for you to tell me
          something. I came here to tell you
          something.

          CLOSER: BILLIE
          She sees in Winstead's face, the look of people she grew up
          with. Billie senses none of the cunning of the lawyer/special
          agents she's been dealing with. She leans forward, indicates
          a cigarette out of Winstead's pocket.
          He hands her one and lights it.

          BILLIE
          Okay, Mr. Winstead. What do you got to
          tell me?
          Winstead leans forward.

          BILLIE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUOUS)
          They say you're the man who shot him?

          WINSTEAD
          'M'at's right. One of them.

          BILLIE
          6 why are you coming here to see me? To
          see the damage you done?

          WINSTEAD
          Because he asked me to.
          This gets Billie's attention and she looks more closely at
          Winstead.

          WINSTEAD (CONT'D)
          When he went down, he said something. And
          I put my ear next to his mouth and what I
          think he said was this. He said...

          (BEAT)
          " .tell Billie for me...Bye Bye
          Blackbird..."
          Billie has to rise and turn away from Winstead so that he
          doesn't see her overcome with emotion. Winstead knows this.
          It is the measure of this man that he respected the privacy
          of John Dillinger's message and only told her.



                               THE END
