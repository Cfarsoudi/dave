                            Mark Frost and Michael France
 

                          based on the Marvel comic book by
                               Stan Lee and Jack Kirby




                                                           Shooting Script
               



               FADE IN:

               CLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD

               Our first thought: DR. DOOM?  But it's not moving.  A
               welder's torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor
               on scaffolding.  This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up
               of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously
               extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA.  His face
               is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect).  Past sparks, we
               MOVE down to pick up...

               EXT. STREET/VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

               REED RICHARDS and BEN GRIMM head toward the soaring glass-box
               atrium of VDI Headquarters.  Designed to inspire awe, it
               does.

                                   REED
                         High open space, exposed structural
                         elements.  Obviously aimed at first
                         time visitors to create feelings of...
                         smallness, inadequacy.

               Ben glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous.

                                   BEN
                         Good thing it ain't workin... Reed,
                         what are we doing here?  This guy's
                         fast-food, strip-mall science --

                                   REED
                         This wasn't our first stop, in case
                         you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not
                         that bad.  He's just a little...
                             (seeing the statue)
                         Larger than life.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

               They move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium.

                                   REED
                         He's financed some of the biggest
                         breakthroughs of this century.

                                   BEN
                         You'd never know it.

               He motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's
               accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first
               private Space Station.

               All images have VICTOR front and center, glad-handling George
               Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders.  The last
               image is Victor holding the AMERICA'S CUP.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Jesus.  That too?

               They reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS.

                                   REED
                         Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see --

               A receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass.

                                   FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                         Executive elevator, top floor.

                                   BEN
                         What's the price for a smile round here?

               They head for the elevator.  Reed carries a small, black box. 
               As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO --

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY

               A large, dark office.  Ben in the corner.  He yawns,
               watches...

               BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars.  Planets.  They hover in the air,
               making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         My research suggests that exposure to
                         a high-energy cosmic storm born on
                         solar winds might have triggered the
                         evolution of early planetary life.

               REED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS
               FIGURE in shadow behind a desk.  An ominous, PULSATING RED
               CLOUD covers the stars.  It washes over a hologram of EARTH.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         In six weeks another cloud with the
                         same elemental profile will pass
                         Earth's orbit.  A study in space could
                         advance our knowledge about the
                         structure of the human genome, and
                         help cure countless diseases, extend
                         human life --

               The SHADOW clears his throat.  Reed speeds up, emotional.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Give kids the chance to be stronger,
                         healthier, less prone to --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Turn it off.  Please.

               The figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness.

                                   REED
                         But I haven't fully explained my --

                                   SHADOWED FIGURE
                         Yes you have... Imagination.
                         Creativity.  Passion.  Those were
                         always your trademarks.

               Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR
               VON DOOM.  35, handsome, commanding.  He looks almost...
               airbrushed.  He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk.  REED is
               on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT
               CUTBACKS.              

                                   VICTOR
                         But dreams don't pay the bills, do
                         they?
                             (a condescending smile)
                         Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. 
                         Still reaching for the stars, with the
                         world on your back.

                                   REED
                         You remember in school we talked about
                         working together.  That's what I was
                         about to explain...

               Reed presses the remote.  Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE
               slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION.  Both bear the
               VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo.  Victor smiles, more intrigued.

                                   VICTOR
                         So it's not my money you want.  It's
                         my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't
                         trust you, why should I?

               Victor is a step ahead.  Reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  Ben
               wakes up, suspicious.  Victor notices.  He notices
               everything.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         That's my job.  To stay a step ahead. 
                         To know what other men don't.

               Ben gets close to Reed, turning toward the door.

                                   BEN
                         I can't take this.

                                   REED
                             (low, quiet)
                         Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
                         
               A beat.  Victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension.  And...

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         He's right, Ben.

               They turn to see...SUE STORM (demure, stunning) standing in a
               corner...possibly for the whole presentation.  A little cold:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         It's just business.

                                   VICTOR
                         I think you both know my Director of
                         Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

                                   BEN
                         Heya Susie.
                             (under breath, to Reed)
                         One more thing he's got.

               Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes
               off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, it's been too long.

               She gives Reed a polite handshake.  Victor watches carefully. 
               Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze.  A little tongue-tied.

                                   REED
                         You're, you've, I mean, how have you
                         bee--

                                   SUE
                         Never better.

               Victor sizes them up.  He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR
                         This isn't going to be a problem, is
                         it?

                                   REED
                         Not at all.

                                   SUE
                         Ancient history.

               Victor smiles, eyeing Sue.

                                   VICTOR
                         Good.  Then you're just in time to
                         hear the great Reed Richards ask me
                         for help.
                             (to Reed)
                         You know, you made a lot of folks at
                         MIT feel like a junior high science
                         fair.  So you'll excuse me if I savor
                         the moment.

               Ben tightens.  A hard beat.  Reed sucks it up.

                                   REED
                         You back this mission, and I'll sign
                         over a fair percentage of any
                         applications or --

                                   VICTOR
                         The number's seventy-five.  And it's
                         applications and patents.

                                   BEN
                         What about his first born?

                                   REED
                             (quiet)
                         Ben, the money's not important.  We
                         could save lives.

               Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.

                                   VICTOR
                         Twenty-five percent of a billion is
                         enough to keep the lights on, isn't
                         it?  Maybe even pay off your fourth
                         mortgage on the Baxter Building.

               They look at Victor.  How does he know all this...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Deal...?

               Reed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no.  But
               Reed...drops a nod.  Done.  Victor smiles, offers a
               handshake.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Well then, to our future.  Together.

               Victor squeezes.  Hard.  His other hand on Sue's shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

                                   REED
                         Hilarious.

               As Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor.  Wary.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

               Director of Communications LEONARD enters, checking files.

                                   VICTOR
                         If Reed's right, then this little trip
                         will double our stock offering.

                                   LEONARD
                         And if he's not...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's always right.  Good thing he
                         doesn't always know what he's got...

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

               Reed and Ben step into the elevator.

                                   BEN
                         He knew about NASA.  What if he made
                         the call to shut us down --

                                   REED
                         Ben, think about all the people we can
                         help if this works --

                                   BEN
                         Maybe you should think about yourself
                         for once.  You always let this guy
                         push you round --

                                   REED
                         We got what we wanted.  That's
                         enough.

                                   BEN
                         I know, I know.  I'm just worried
                         about what he wants... Speaking of
                         which...

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to...SUE.  She joins them.  Doors
               shut.

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

                                   SUE
                         You sure about this, Reed?

               He nods, head down.  He doesn't want eye contact.

                                   REED
                         Those solar winds are flaring, but I
                         factored them into my coordinates and --

                                   SUE
                         I was talking about us.  Working
                         together.

               Sue holds her eyes on Reed.  He is clearly uncomfortable in
               her gaze.  Did the elevator just get smaller?

                                   REED
                             (thinking, talking fast)
                         Well, uh, based on our history...you
                         can handle the biogenetics, and I'll
                         focus on the molecular physics.  Or,
                         uhm, maybe I should take the biotech,
                         you work the microscopes, since you
                         have some background in electropho--

                                   SUE
                             (droll, a little annoyed)
                         Right.  That's exactly what I meant.

               She shakes her head -- same old Reed.  He looks at her --
               what did he say wrong?  Ben smiles, patting Reed on the
               shoulder.

                                   BEN
                         Way to not overthink it.
                             (to Sue)
                         So when do we leave?

                                   SUE
                         I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in
                         the morning to talk about resources
                         and crew.

               She offers a business card.  Reed doesn't take it.

                                   REED
                         I, uh, think I remember the number.


                                   SUE
                         It's been changed.

               Beat.  Ben grimaces.  Reed takes the card, his eyes down.

                                   REED
                         As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could
                         pilot the mission --

                                   SUE
                         Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun,
                         but we already have a pilot on our
                         payroll.  You remember my brother
                         Johnny...

               Off Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY

               A helicopter shot through trees.  We soar over timberland,
               and find something massive looming on the horizon:

               A SPACECRAFT.  A sleek take on a space shuttle.  Modern tech
               combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford. 
               The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. 
               WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred
               foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.

               EXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY

               Ben stares up at the craft.  A sneer on his face.

                                   BEN
                         Can't do it.  I cannot do it.

                                   REED
                         External SRBs, orbital system engines. 
                         Its just like the shuttles you flew
                         in --

                                   BEN
                         No.  I cannot take orders from that
                         underwear model.  That wingnut washed
                         out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria
                         Secret wannabes into a flight 
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         Youthful high spirits.

               They walk toward the base of the scaffolding.

                                   BEN
                         They crashed it into a wall.  A flight
                         simulator.

                                   REED
                         I'm sure he's matured since then.

               CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. 
               PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's
               driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.  PICK UP
               Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         When have I asked you to do something
                         you absolutely said you could not do?

                                   BEN
                         Five times.

                                   REED
                         I had it at four.

                                   BEN
                         This makes five.

               INT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               Reed and Ben unpack gear into lockers.  Suddenly --

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Captain on the bridge!

               Ben goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with
               a digital camera.  Then advances, as Ben realizes who it
               is...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Digital camera: $254.  Memory stick:
                         $59.  The look on your hard-ass former
                         CO's grill when he finds out he's your
                         junior officer: priceless.

               Ben eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him. 
               Johnny flinches.  But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper,
               adjusts his uniform.

                                   BEN
                         I can handle the ship.  I can even
                         handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I
                         don't know if I should be flying or
                         playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the
                         hell came up with them?

                                   SUE
                         Victor did.

               Sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying
               a stack of flightsuits.  She hands them out to the guys.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         The synthetics act as a second skin,
                         adapting to your individual needs to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Keep the hot side hot, and the cool
                         side cool!

                                   REED
                         Wow.  Fantastic.

               Reed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit.  She wonders,
               maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Material made from self-regulating
                         unstable molecules.  I've been working
                         on a formula for this.

                                   SUE
                         Great minds think alike.

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         Guess some think faster than others.

               Victor enters, wearing his custom-tailored flightsuit.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         I hired Armani to design the pattern. 
                         These colors will look great on
                         camera.

               A DOOR OPENS.  Leonard enters, in a sharp suit.

                                   LEONARD
                         They're ready for you, sir.

                                   VICTOR
                         Showtime.

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - HALLS - NIGHT

               Leonard leads Victor through the halls.  Victor checks
               himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.

                                   LEONARD
                         Our numbers are through the roof.  The
                         IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a
                         share.  The bank's five times
                         oversubscribed --

                                   VICTOR
                         It's not just the money.  I could make
                         money in my sleep.

                                   LEONARD
                         Then what is it?

                                   VICTOR
                         History, Leonard.  History. 
                         Everything else is conversation...
                             (a beat)
                         How's the other matter?

               Leonard pulls out a BOX.  Opens it: a TEN KARAT DIAMOND RING.

                                   LEONARD
                         Harry Winston sends his regards.

               They hit a set of big doors.  Victor stops and looks into the
               reflective, metallic surface on the wall.  He fixes one last
               strand of hair.  Perfect. Then he opens the door to... 

               SNAP!SNAP!SNAP!  WHIP-PAN a row of CAMERAS snapping shots of --

               EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - NIGHT

               Retrofitted into a makeshift press area.  Victor sits on a
               platform, with reporters stretched out below him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Today we stand on the edge of a new
                         frontier.  In the furthest depths of
                         outer space...we will find the secrets
                         to inner space.  The final key to
                         unlocking our genetic code lies in a
                         cosmic storm...

               BEHIND THE ACTION: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk past.  News
               crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture. 
               Our "Fantastic Four" are not exactly big news.  Not yet.

                                   BEN
                         Isn't that your speech?

                                   REED
                         He's made a few changes.

                                   BEN
                         This is your dream, Reed.  You should
                         be the one up there.

                                   REED
                         Victor's better at these things.

               Just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,
               waiting.  This is DEBBIE, Ben's fiancée.  And for the first
               time in the entire film...Ben SMILES.  They hug, kissing. 

               Johnny and Reed watch.  Reed glances at Sue, who walks ahead. 
               Debbie slips a photo into Ben's flightsuit.  A tender beat.

                                   BEN
                         I'll be watching over you.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Just get back soon, or I start looking
                         for a new groom.

               Ben looks at the little ENGAGEMENT RING on her finger.

                                   BEN
                         Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that
                         in for a bigger rock.

                                   DEBBIE
                         I don't care about rocks, I care about
                         you.
                             (to Reed)
                         You bring him back in one piece, or
                         you can forget being Best Man.

               Reed nods, smiles.  Debbie gives Ben a last kiss.  Ben turns
               to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile.

                                   BEN
                         What the hell you smiling at?  Just
                         keep your mouth shut, and your mind on
                         those SMBs --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Actually, the engines are SMEs.
                         Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. 
                         Couple generations past your last
                         ride.
                             (at the threshold)
                         I'm not as dumb as you look.

               Ben just glares at Reed.  This is going to be a long trip. 
               As they follow after Sue, we CUT BACK TO --

               VICTOR ON STAGE

               Mid-speech.  Playing behind him is REED'S HOLOGRAM: stars
               give way to a pulsating red cloud...

                                   VICTOR
                         Think of a world without genetic flaws
                         -- no asthma, allergies, baldness,
                         breast cancer...

               Ben and Reed hear the speech.  Ben bristles.

                                   BEN
                         What's wrong with being bald...?

               Victor smiles at the crowd, commanding.  A true leader.

                                   VICTOR
                         Darwin discovered evolution.  Now we --
                         I -- will define it.  Only in America
                         could...

               The red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the Earth.

                                   VICTOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         ...a little country boy from Latveria
                         build one of the biggest companies in
                         the world, and truly reach the stars. 
                         Now if you'll excuse me, history
                         awaits...

               On those words, the HOLOGRAM TRANSFORMS TO...Von Doom's
               SHUTTLE on the launch pad.  BOOM!  THRUSTERS FIRE WHITE HOT. 
               Smoke billows across the pad.  Ready for take off.

               Victor walks past the hologram and exits.  His departure
               perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.

               We push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves
               Earth's atmosphere.  BOOM -- booster rockets fall away and
               the shuttle fires its thrusters.  The hologram transitions
               to...

               A shot of the SPACE STATION high above the Earth.  The
               shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with
               engines afire.  As the shuttle approaches the station we CUT
               TO --

               EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME

               THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above
               Earth.  THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME

               Victor and Sue lead the others into the command center.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (a "dad voice": to Ben)
                         If you behave, maybe next time
                         daddy'll let you drive.

                                   BEN
                         Keep talking, there won't be a next
                         time.

               Reed is focused on THE EARTH.

                                   SUE
                         Long way from the projection booth at
                         the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

               Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would
               bring that up.  It's the first time she's been nice to him so
               far.  He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with
               Sue.

                                   REED
                         Yes.  Yes it is.

               Johnny and Ben exchange a look.  Reed keeps looking at the
               stars, eyes wide, like a little kid.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               They enter the nerve center of the space station.  Victor
               goes to a computer console on the observation deck below. 
               The windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe.

                                   VICTOR
                             (to ground; via comm-link)
                         Leonard, how's the feed?

                                   LEONARD (V.O.)
                         Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.

               Victor glances at a camera mounted into the console.

                                   SUE
                         We can monitor the cloud's approach
                         and observe the tests from here.

                                   BEN
                         Is it safe?

                                   REED
                         The shields on the station should
                         protect us.

                                   BEN
                         Should?

                                   VICTOR
                         What's wrong, Ben?  Eighty-million
                         dollars worth of equipment not enough
                         for you?

               Ben turns to Victor.  A little tension.  Reed cuts it:

                                   REED
                         Let's start loading those samples. 
                         Get your suit ready, Ben.

               Victor keeps his eyes on Ben.

                                   VICTOR
                         So you still do all the heavy lifting?

               Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Maybe you should have stayed back in
                         the lab.  Field work never suited you.

               Reed doesn't defend himself.  Ben steps up.

                                   BEN
                         He does the talking.  I do the
                         walking.  Got it?

               Victor holds tight to his smile.  He nods, condescending.

                                   VICTOR
                         Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm
                         going to borrow Susan for a second.

                                   REED
                         Sure.

               Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO --

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - LATER

               Ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots. 
               Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart,
               each containing a variety of plants.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me your dawg's not trying
                         to rekindle things with my sister.

                                   BEN
                         'Course not.  Strictly business.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, well, his eyes say different.

                                   BEN
                         Hey, two hearts got busted last time. 
                         Maybe she's not over it either.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the
                         year, more coin than God?  Or Reed,
                         the world's dumbest smart guy worth
                         less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's
                         a toss-up.

                                   BEN
                         Put your tiny little mind at ease.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Don't you wander off, boy.

               Johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.  He
               looks through a small window to see Ben give the thumbs up. 
               THE AIRLOCK DOOR opens, and Ben gracefully steps into space.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Sue descends the stairs at Victor's behest.  Joins him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

                                   SUE
                         I understand the business reasons.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, when you're looking at your
                         future, it never hurts to find closure
                         about the past.

               Sue's eyes narrow.  What is this about...?

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Susan, every man dreams that he'll
                         meet some woman he can give the world
                         to.

               He presses a button and the observation deck's outer windows
               open up, revealing a spectacular, romantic view of the EARTH.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

               While she stares out the window, Victor reaches into a
               pocket, revealing a RING BOX.  Sue looks unsettled.

               INT. SPACE STATION - NEARBY CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

               Reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall.  The
               results of his calculations are not what he expected... He
               sees WIND VELOCITY digits rise.  He does a double-take when
               he sees the readout: EVENT THRESHOLD, T-MINUS 10:00.

                                   REED
                         No...no...impossible.  It's...too
                         fast.

               INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

               Behind his back, Victor holds the ring box in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         You've been with me two years now.

               Sue doesn't know where this is going.  She treads lightly.

                                   SUE
                         It's been a good two years, Victor...
                         The company's accomplished so much.

                                   VICTOR
                         Right, of course, the company... But
                         you see, I've come to realize all the
                         accomplishments in the world mean
                         nothing without someone to share them
                         with --

                                   SUE
                         Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done
                         something to make you think...

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of
                         taking big steps.  And this is the
                         biggest step yet.  If it helps, think
                         of this as a promotion.  A merger of
                         sorts...
                             (getting closer)
                         Four little words that can change our
                         lives...

               He is about to spring the ring on her.  She looks like a deer
               in headlights.  She opens her mouth, and...WHAM!  Doors slam
               open.  REED RUSHES INTO THE ROOM.

                                   REED
                         The cloud is accelerating!

               Victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I don't know what happened.

               Sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify Reed's
               claim.  Starts punching buttons.  Confirms Reed's findings
               with a nod.  Victor hardens, in control.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         We've got minutes until it hits, not
                         hours...Victor, that storm's deadly --
                         the radiation's lethal.  We need to
                         abort.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all
                         this way to lose our nerve at the
                         first little glitch.  Just close the
                         shields...

                                   REED
                         Ben's still out there --

                                   VICTOR
                         So reel him in.  But we came here to
                         do a job.  So let's do it.  Quickly.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

               Ben is carefully arranging SAMPLE BOXES OF PLANTS.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben, we need you back inside.

               Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         I ain't done arranging your flowers,
                         egghead.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around.

               Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him.  Ben
               turns and sees: THE COSMIC STORM, rumbling toward the
               station.  Not close, but not far.  That gets Ben's attention.

                                   BEN (INTO RADIO)
                         Roger that, on my way.

               He turns back towards the ship.  BEHIND HIM, the storm grows.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME TIME

               Victor rushes into the room, looks at the monitors.  Sees the
               others near the airlock on one screen, and the approaching
               cloud on another.  Anxiety creeps across his face.

                                   AUTOMATED VOICE
                         Event threshold in two minutes.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               Reed and Johnny stand by the airlock, waiting for Ben.  They
               heard the automated voice.  It panics Reed.

                                   REED
                         Come on, Ben, come on...

                                   VICTOR (ON RADIO)
                         Reed, we're running out of time.

               EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

               A wake of turbulence from the cloud hits Ben, making it
               harder to maneuver.  The cloud's tendrils snake toward him.

               INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

               They can see Ben outside the window, still twenty yards away. 
               The entire corridor rumbles.  Lights flicker and spark.  They
               watch helplessly.

               INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

               Sue watches the monitor, also helpless.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny... Reed...

               Victor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to
               Sue.  Practically shoves her aside as he hits the INTERCOM.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed, you need to get up here so we
                         can close the shields!  Now!

               Sue glares at Victor.  His lack of compassion shocks her.

                                   REED (ON RADIO)
                         Not until Ben is back inside!

                                   VICTOR
                         It's too late for him, and soon it'll
                         be too late for all of us.

               Victor doesn't bother to wait for a response.  He takes over
               the console, punching keys.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing?

                                   VICTOR
                         Raising the shields.

                                   SUE
                         You can't leave them out there.

               Sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.

                                   VICTOR
                         Watch me.  Reed had his chance.  You
                         can't help them any more than I can.

               Beat.  She takes a step toward the door.  Not sure what to
               do.

                                   SUE
                         I can try.

               With one final glare, she bolts from the room.

               Reed bites his lip.  Thinks.  He decides.

                                   REED
                         Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the
                         command center.  Close the shields.
                         
                                   JOHNNY
                         What about you?

               One look from Reed tells Johnny, he won't leave without Ben. 
               Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage.  He's not going either.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)

               The exterior air lock door slides open.  In agonizing,
               weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside. 

               The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a
               hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange
               stains.  Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.  Ben
               hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.

               Clutching the diamond ring, Victor stands defiantly.  Showing
               absolutely no concern for the others.  Interested only in the
               event itself.  Lights and equipment FALL, CRASHING around
               him.

               A control panel EXPLODES in Victor's face.  He jumps back,
               and into the falling equipment.  Collapses under the weight.

               Sue rounds a corner, sees Reed and Johnny.

               SLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as:

               -- JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel.
               -- REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door.
               -- VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket.
               -- THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin.

               SLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a
               SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben
               in the back, ripping through his suit.  The exterior door
               shuts and seals.  The station loses all power.  DARKNESS.

               EXT. SPACE STATION - DAY

               As quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away,
               leaving the space station intact.  Power quietly flickers on. 

               Silence.  Time resumes.  All four pick up exactly where they
               left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them.

               INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

               Victor emerges from the rubble.  He stands, checks his body. 
               A few scrapes, nothing serious.  A thin, throbbing CUT on his
               head.  He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding.

               INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY

               Reed and Johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door. 
               Sue joins them, as they pull Ben in.  They try to remove his
               helmet.  We don't see his face, but he's clearly unconscious.

                                   REED
                         He's not responsive --

               A BLACK SCREEN:

                         Ben, wake up!  Wake up!

               SUBJECTIVE CAMERA, BEN'S POV: The blurry image of Johnny
               comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Where...where am I?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Back on Earth.  Victor's medical
                         facility... We're in quarantine.

                         They're fine.  Everybody else...is
                         fine.

               Johnny looks away, as if he can't bear to lay eyes on him.

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         What's wrong with me?

                                   JOHNNY
                         I swear to you they've done everything
                         humanly possible.  The best plastic
                         surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had

                         Give me a mirror...

               Johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before Ben can
               reach it, reluctant to give it to him.

                                   JOHNNY
                         They said that's not such a good idea,
                         the shock alone could --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Give me the god damn mirror!

               Ben grabs it from him.  Then slowly raises it to look and see
               that...except for some serious stubble, Ben's totally normal.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Unfortunately, the doctors just
                         couldn't do anything to fix your face!

               He cackles as he heads for the door.  Ben heaves the mirror
               at him, breaking it into hundreds of pieces.  He turns to the
               side-table, and grabs that picture of DEBBIE.  It calms him.

               A modern facility of glass and stone, nestled in the forest. 
               In stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Reed walks down the hall.  His hair is GRAYING at the
               temples.  He passes Johnny, who is smiling, still enjoying
               his joke on Ben.  Johnny slows, looking at Reed's hair.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice 'do.  Going for the "grandpa"
                         look?

               Reed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs.  He
               keeps going.  He passes a partially open door.  He stops when
               he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed.  He sees a vase of
               flowers.  He grabs a couple lilies, and enters.

               But Reed sees...the room is already FILLED with expensive
               flowers.  All from VICTOR.  Reed is trumped once again.

               A DOCTOR writes on Sue's chart.  A wall TV plays a press
               conference with Victor, outside the FACILITY.  He looks worse
               for wear.  A few hairs out of place, and a small BANDAGE on
               his face.  We PUSH INTO the press conference --

               Victor pauses.  For the first time.  Just a flicker.

                         then you're all cleared. 

               The Doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out.  Reed steps to
               Sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand.  Quiet:

                         Sue...I want to tell you...I'm...

               WHOOSH.  A NURSE rolls in with a tray bearing ten more
               extravagant bouquets.  Reed looks resigned.  He walks out.

                         favorites.

               Reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash. 

               Sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed.

               Johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful
               fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  In the blink of
               an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD.

               They both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital
               read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast.

                         up.

               He hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the

               Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         How you doing?

               Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.

                                   REED
                         I don't know.  I just keep going over
                         and over the numbers.

                                   BEN
                         Reed.  Even you can't compute every
                         little thing.

                                   REED
                         I should have done more, run more
                         tests --

               Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.

                                   BEN
                         It was a freak of nature.  Last I
                         checked, you don't have a crystal
                         ball.  Let it go.

               Reed considers.  But he can't let it go.  He opens his
               computer back up, returning to work.  Ben shakes his head,
               looks out at the view.  His eyes catch on something, wheels
               turning.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You go through something like this,
                         makes you appreciate having the right
                         woman in your life.

                                   REED
                         Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --

                                   BEN
                         Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.

               Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE.

                                   REED
                         What?  Come on.  She's got a good
                         thing with Victor --

                                   BEN
                         I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen
                         your screws?

                                   REED
                         He's smart, powerful, successful --

                                   BEN
                         Well maybe you should date him.

               Reed looks at Ben, resigned.

                                   REED
                         Ben.  He'll give her the life she
                         deserves.  She ended up with the right
                         guy.  Things worked out for the best.

               Reed steps away.  Ben stands alone, an idea sparking.

                                   BEN
                         Do I have to do everything myself?

               INT. HELICOPTER/EXT. MOUNTAIN SUMMIT - DAY

               The chopper hovers over this pristine peak.  JOHNNY and his
               NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear. 
               Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.

               His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out. 
               Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation.  They
               look down at a death-defying black diamond run.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Me like-y.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Stay right.  Left is trouble.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I though we went over this.

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         Last one down springs for room
                         service.

               She pulls down her goggles, jumps out.  Johnny drops out
               after her, hitting the snow.  He smolders: literally.  The
               snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.

               He takes off after her and the chase is on:

               EXT. BLACK DIAMOND RUN - DAY

               The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in
               and out of the trees through deep powder.  Johnny's a speed
               freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them. 

               Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire,
               flies off.  Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.

               The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even. 
               She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         You're on fire!

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not this again --

                                   SEXY NURSE
                         No: You're ON FIRE!

               Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm. 
               His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire. 
               A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.

               Nurse loses concentration, falls.  Johnny races away like a
               missile, screaming in exhilaration.  He looks back -- no
               nurse.

               He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally
               VEERS to the LEFT.  He fails to notice the giant CHASM in
               front of him.  He faces forward and...

               SCREEAAMMS!  LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying
               to catch ground.  FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS
               towards the rocks below.  He tries to will his body away. 

               Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame.  He is a HUMAN
               TORCH!  And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving
               him some kind of...LIFT.  He maneuvers just over the rocks,
               almost making a 90 degree turn.

               He looks back at the rocks in disbelief.  But the lift
               doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a
               snowbank.

               He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't.  He's trapped
               under snow and ice.  With all his strength, he tries to move,
               NO DICE.  Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around
               quickly begins to melt.  Johnny is on fire, and within
               seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the
               water.

               The nurse races toward the steam.  Scared, panicked.  She
               finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot
               tub, staring at his hands.  His body.  Exhilarated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Care to join me?

               She smiles and unzips.  The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               On an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, Victor
               prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about. 
               He checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.

                                   VICTOR
                         How's the IPO?

                                   LEONARD
                         Stable.  We're looking at low
                         twenties.  It's a good number,
                         considering the fallout from --

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed's disaster.  You know, I half-
                         think he did this to me on purpose.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --

               But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Get me on the AM shows, Larry King,
                         cover of the Journal...
                             (staring into silver tray)
                         I've got to do something about this
                         scar.  Make sure they only shoot my
                         right side.

                                   LEONARD
                         Actually, uh, people seem to think the
                         scar "humanizes" you.

                                   VICTOR
                         And that's a good thing?

               Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.  It
               glistens in the silver tray.  His eyes are bloodshot,
               sleepless.

                                   LEONARD
                         You know, maybe you should get some
                         rest --

                                   VICTOR
                         Later.  First, I've got some
                         unfinished business.  A deal that
                         needs closing...

               Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread.  A beat.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? 
                         You could have any woman in the world
                         but --

                                   VICTOR
                         That's why.  Because I could have
                         any other woman... You know, when
                         they asked Caesar "why England," he
                         said, "because it's not mine."

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

               Two dozen EMPLOYEES sit and eat.  Others serve themselves at
               the buffet.  Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall --

                                   SUE
                         I can only stay for one drink, Ben. 
                         I've got to meet with Victor.

                                   BEN
                         Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

               They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Hey Reed, what are you doing here?
                             (before he can answer)
                         Great, why don't you join us?

               He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table. 
               Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the
                         buffet.

               Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING

               The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The
               room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp
               on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.

                                   BEN
                         Pardon me...

               Sue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again.

                                   REED
                         Are you alright?

                                   BEN
                         I think I need to lie down.  Bad
                         shrimp.

               This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,
               unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Really bad shrimp.

               ANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat. 
               A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this
               woman.

                                   REED
                         Feeling better?

                                   SUE
                         Yes, thanks.

                                   REED
                         That's good.  That's uh...good.

                                   SUE
                         You always had a way with words.
                             (an awkward beat)
                         I should be getting back.

               Sue gets up to leave.  Exasperated, Reed tries to think of
               something, anything, to say.

                                   REED
                         I'm really happy for you and Victor.

               She slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more.

                                   SUE
                         You're happy for me and Victor.

                                   REED
                         I can tell you guys are enjoying what
                         was the best part of our relationship --

                                   SUE
                         Which was?

                                   REED
                         Passion.

               We see surprise on Sue's face, and...

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         For science.

                                   SUE
                             (frustrated)
                         You are such a dork, Reed... You never
                         got it and never will unless it's
                         explained to you in quantum physics.

               As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around
               her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.

                                   REED
                         What?  What did I say?

               She looks more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         It's never what you say.  It's what
                         you don't say. What you don't do...

               She lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt --
               she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.

                                   REED
                         I...I...I just wanted to --

               As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.

                                   SUE
                         It's been two years, and all you can
                         say is you're happy for me and some
                         other guy...
                             (standing up, hurt)
                         You know, Victor may be a lot of
                         things, but at least he's not afraid
                         to fight for what he wants...
                             (Reed looks down)
                         And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. 
                         To be heard...seen... Reed, look at
                         me.

               He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her
               cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue...?  I can't.

                                   SUE
                         What?  What do you mean you --

                                   REED
                         Sue...look at your hands.

               She raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a
               medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her
               clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.

               Sue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a
               GLASS off the table...

               SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed
               instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two
               feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- 

               Then snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in
               disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue
               reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         You guys will not believe what just
                         happened!

               They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for
               the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               CLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides
               out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair
               to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He
               PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR. 

               It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor
               peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. 
               Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING

               DOUBLE DOORS burst open.  Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently
               walk.

                                   SUE
                         It has to be the cloud.  It's
                         fundamentally altered our DNA.

                                   REED
                         Let's not jump to conclusions, we need
                         a massive amount of evidence before
                         making that leap.

               Reed glances over his shoulder.  He stares.  Sue follows his
               gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire.  He SNAPS his
               fingers.  They GO OUT.  He's totally unharmed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Now what is up with that?

                                   REED
                             (deadpan)
                         The cloud has fundamentally altered
                         our DNA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?

                                   SUE
                         Apparently I can disappear.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Please tell me you go silent too. 

               Only one thing on Reed's mind --

                                   REED
                         We have to find Ben.

               EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive
               bursts of flame.  He turns it on and off, like the "CLAPPER."

                                   JOHNNY
                         Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame
                         off --

                                   SUE
                         Johnny.

               He does it again.  Flame on, flame off.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Stop it.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay, "mom."

               Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the
               banging, moaning and pleading inside.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my
                         nurse!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Ben, are you there?

               A creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and
               gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the
               contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough
               and craggy.  SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         Open up Ben, we need to talk.

               It all stops.  A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way
               and it crashes to the floor.  Under the covers, he groans in
               pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:

                                   BEN
                         LEAVE ME ALONE!!!

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed decides they can't wait any longer.  He kneels to the
               floor.  He concentrates, not sure if it will work...
               Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE
               DOORJAMB.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed's arm wriggles under the door.  It bends upward, swiping
               clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob.  Rubbery fingers
               find the latch and unlock the door.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Reed focuses, and pulls.  His arm snakes out from under the
               door and snaps back into place.  His flesh and bones
               reforming before their eyes.  Johnny stares at Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Ewwwwwwww.  That is disgusting.

               They hear a tremendous SMASH from inside the room.

               INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               They open the door.  The room is trashed.  Every stick of
               furniture smashed to splinters.

                                   REED
                         ...Ben?

               Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used
               to be.  They rush to it.  Looking out they see SOMETHING
               LARGE in the distance, running away.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What is that thing?

                                   SUE
                         I think that thing is Ben.

               Reed looks out, emotions roiling.  Is that his best
               friend...?  Suddenly, Victor comes around the corner (bandage
               bigger).

                                   VICTOR
                         What's going on?

                                   SUE
                         Victor, are you feeling alright?

               He considers, but never shows weakness.  He nods.

                                   VICTOR
                         Just a little banged up.  A couple
                         scrapes.  Why?

                                   REED
                         Ben did this.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben did this?

                                   REED
                         He's had some kind of...reaction to
                         exposure from the cloud.  And he's not
                         the only one.

                                   SUE
                         We need to find him.

               Victor redirects his attention to Sue.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Victor, I'm sorry I --

                                   VICTOR
                             (cold)
                         Just find him.

               Victor strides off, leaving the others.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Anybody know where the big guy's
                         going?

               We PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed
               knows exactly where Ben is going.

                                   REED
                         He's going home.

               EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

               A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance. 
               CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo
               trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where...

               A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide
               open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or
               someTHING barrels into the night.

               EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking
               glass.

               INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

               SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip,
               shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large.

               EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben.

               CLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but
               they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more
               and more frustrated.  He manages to press "0" with his pinky.

                                   BEN
                         Hello, Operator?

               Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a
               modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees
               Debbie grab the phone.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Deb... It's me.  I need you to step
                         out front.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Out front?  You home, baby?  I got
                         a surprise for you.

               He blinks hard.  Sad, dark.

                                   BEN
                         I got a surprise for you too.

               EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT

               Debbie steps out.  There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the
               door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something
               shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Ben?

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         Don't come any closer for a sec.  This
                         is gonna be kind of a shock... You
                         remember when we said "together
                         forever no matter what"?

                                   DEBBIE
                         Baby, you're scaring me.

               A hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE
               HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he
               once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.

               Debbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to
               think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to
                         Ben?

                                   BEN
                         Deb, it's me.  It's still me.

               He reaches out.  She recoils.  It's too much for her.  Tears
               swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away.

               He takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over
               her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a
               halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries
               back.

                                   DEBBIE
                         Don't...don't...DON'T TOUCH ME!

               Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he
               has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time
               he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist.

                                   BEN
                         I love you, Deb.

               With that, he turns away.  The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters,
               falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on
               around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.

               INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY

               Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: "VDM" emblazoned
               on a gold plate.  Leonard waits not-so-patiently.

                                   VICTOR
                         Make sure you find Ben, bring him back
                         here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't
                         need this to hit the press.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at
                         eight, then a nine-thirty interview
                         with the Journal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Front page?

                         Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who
                         knows...maybe Washington.

               Victor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him.

                                   VICTOR
                         Leonard.  Think bigger.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               We swoop toward this epic monument.  On a steel girder above
               the road, we see...a STATUE.  BEN.  He sits on the edge of
               the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,
               muttering.

                                   BEN
                         A few days in space, it'll be great,
                         what's the worst that could happen?

               A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on
               his shoulder.  Ben just glares up at the heavens.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Perfect.  Thanks.

               He hears the sound of someone SOBBING.  He turns to see...a
               distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase.  The man drops his
               case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.

               The Businessman looks out, ready to jump.  He doesn't see Ben
               (or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You think you got trouble?  Take a
                         good look, pal, how bad could it be?

               The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.  Ben steps forward.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, easy there, buddy.

               Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY!  His
               arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight
               while his legs thrash over speeding traffic.  Cars and trucks
               SKIM right underfoot.  Ben shakes his head.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         You had to choose my spot, didn't you?

               Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam!  The
               Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP!  He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing
               hard on the highway!  A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben.  They point. 

               Ben looks up, deer in headlights.  He sees a massive TRUCK
               bearing down on the Businessman.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         This is really not my day.

               Ben DROPS to the street.  WHOOMPF!  He lands in front of the
               Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and
               turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.

               The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide.  The truck SWERVES,
               but cannot stop!  Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little
               scared.  He shuts his eyes, and...

               SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK!  A football move.  The
               truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to
               the windshield!  It looks like a metal car-compactor.

               The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders. 
               CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A
               FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT!  Windows shatter, fires flicker. 
               One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER.  COPS clamber out.

               EXT. CAB ON HIGHWAY - DAY

               Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back.  They see the action
               on the bridge.  Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the
               destruction.  He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped
               in his cab.  Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.

               He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the
               airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon.  He tries to grab
               the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG.  He struggles.

                                   BEN
                         A little help here?!  You wanna hit
                         that button, sir?

               The driver is too woozy.  Ben can't get to the button. 
               Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE
               DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab!  COPS round the corner. 
               They see Ben holding onto the Driver.  They raise their guns.

                                   COP
                         FREEZE!  PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
                         DOWN!

               Ben looks at the cops.  PEDESTRIANS stare, point.  He
               realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man
               in hand.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - APPROACH - DAY

               At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops.  The
               whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  We PUSH
               TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...

               REED, JOHNNY, SUE.  They look through smoke and mayhem to
               see...their first full look at Ben.  Reed stands gutpunched.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Not even Ben deserves that.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it.  He lunges
               behind a truck.  The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them
               back.  Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.

               He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on
               walkways overhead.  He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING
               MOTORISTS.  He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - GRIDLOCK - DAY

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames.  All other
               people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  BRIDGE POLICE herd
               the crowd away from the accident.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Back!  We're evac-ing the bridge. 

               Reed, Sue, and Johnny slow down, swap glances.

                                   SUE
                         What now?  Reed...?  What do we do?

               MOVE IN ON REED.  A first test of leadership.  But he is not
               a leader.  Not yet.  Sue gets closer to him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Ben's out there.  Let's go get him.

                                   BRIDGE COP
                         Maybe you didn't hear me.  Those cars
                         are gonna blow sky high, any second.

                                   REED
                         Look, we've got a friend out there in
                         trouble.  We need to get to him before --

                                   BRIDGE COP #2
                         Nobody gets past this point.

               A hard beat.  Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod.

                                   SUE
                         What?

                                   REED
                             (mutters)
                         We need to get past them.

               He motions to her body.  She understands.  She concentrates,
               and starts to turn invisible.

                                   BRIDGE COP #1
                         What the hell is this?  A magic show?

               But her clothes don't go invisible.  Beat.  Reed mutters:

                                   REED
                         Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.

                                   SUE
                         What...?
                             (realizes)
                         Oh.

               She unbuttons her blouse.  Not thrilled with the idea.  She
               wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She
               reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses
               concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her
               undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned. 

               The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of
               bricks.  Cops are transfixed.  So is Reed.

                                   JOHNNY
                         This is wrong in so many ways.

                                   REED
                         You've been working out.

                                   SUE
                         Shut up.

               Sue takes a deep breath.  Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing
               happens.  She's embarrassed and furious.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you
                         should strip down next, see how it
                         feels to have fifty people staring --

               ...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.  Undies float.  Jaws drop.

                                   REED
                         Uh, Sue?

               She stops ranting.  Realizes she's gone invisible.

                                   SUE (INVISIBLE)
                         Oh.  Well then...

               The undies drop.  The cops stare open-mouthed.  They turn to
               look at Reed, astonished.  He sheepishly shrugs his
               shoulders.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm gonna need serious therapy.

               A beat.  She walks away.  The cops watch her, gaping.  By the
               time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone,
               disappearing into the clouds of smoke.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best
               angle on the action.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY

               Reed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big
               TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!

               He finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO! 
               His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps.

                                   BEN
                         What the --!

                                   REED
                         Ben.  Are you okay?

                                   BEN
                         Am I okay?!  You wanna explain that?! 

               He motions to Reed's neck.  Then to his own body:

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Or this?!  What the hell am I? 'Cause
                         I sure ain't Ben anymore.

               Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet.

                                   SUE (O.S.)
                         REED!  BEN!  LOOK OUT!

               Ben spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does
               see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!

               BOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty
               cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! 

               Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms
               FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.

               FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. 
               Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving
               him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,
               SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks
               the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.

               Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The
               air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.

               She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields
               SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames
               hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from
               her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... 

               Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE
               FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast
               deflects off the street and into...

               An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF
               THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail
               slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.

               THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE
               WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck
               TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the
               front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!

               He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across
               the concrete, digging grooves into the street.

               ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward
               the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down
               at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The
               HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!

               Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! 
               His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. 
               Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic,
               painful.

               He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. 
               His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the
               truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing
               over Ben.

               Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps
               back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary
               cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...

               The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers
               joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,
               touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. 

               Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;
               he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.

               EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

               Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE.  Ben steps
               toward her, but she stops him with a look.  She places
               something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.

               Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground.  He stoops over
               to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING.  His big fingers can't grip
               it.  He tries in vain.  Hopeless, pathetic.  A beat.  And... 

               A hand grabs the ring.  It's Reed.  Quiet, close.

                                   REED
                         I swear to you, I will do everything
                         in my power until there is not a
                         breath left in me: you are going to be
                         Ben again.

               Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma TV. 
               ON THE TV: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new
               Fantastic Four.  For the first time they strike a heroic
               pose.  Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.

                                   LEONARD
                         Uh, sir...Larry King called, to
                         cancel.
                             (seeing the TV, a beat)
                         Apparently, there's a bigger story.

               Victor sees Reed put his arms around Sue as he covers her
               with the jacket. And the penny drops: he's FURIOUS.  As it
               hits him, he feels something odd.  He looks down at his
               hand...at glints of gleaming METAL poking through flesh.

               EXT./INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - DAY

               An impromptu command center -- a series of police tents,
               surrounded by EMERGENCY VEHICLES, NEWS VANS, FIRETRUCKS.

               INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - TENT - DAY

               Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny sit together, getting changed. 
               They get ready to go, but the CHIEF FIREMAN enters, stopping
               them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         There's some folks outside, want to
                         talk to you.

                                   REED
                         We're not going public with this. 
                         We're scientists, not celebrities.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         Too late, son.

               He turns on a little TV MONITOR in the corner.  NEWS FOOTAGE
               plays on all stations, with the tagline: FANTASTIC FOUR.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         That's what they're calling you.  The
                         Fantastic Four.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Nice.

               Johnny heads for the exit.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Let's think this
                         through, a second.

               Johnny pauses.  Rubs his chin once.  And...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay.  Done thinking.

               He runs out.  Sue, Ben, and Reed swap glances, knowing Johnny
               cannot be their spokesman.  They take off after him, out to --

               EXT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - PRESS FIELD - DAY

               CLICKCLICKCLICK!  Fifty cameras flash.  The field is full of
               press.  Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.

               Johnny eats up the attention.  Ben turns, self-conscious. 
               Reed notices.  The Chief Fireman turns to them.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         So which one of you's the leader?

               Johnny does not hesitate.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That'd be me.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN
                         No seriously.

               A beat.  Sue and Ben turn to Reed.  The Chief hands him a
               mic.

                                   CHIEF FIREMAN (CONT'D)
                         You're on, son.  They all want a
                         statement.

               All eyes go on Reed.  He looks out, gulps hard.  A long beat.

                                   REED
                         Uh, during our recent mission to the
                         Von Doom space station, we were
                         exposed to as yet-unidentified
                         radioactive energy, most likely some
                         kind of nucleotide compoun--

               Nobody came for a science class.  A crush of questions
               overwhelms Reed:

                                   VARIOUS REPORTERS
                         What happened on the bridge?  Does it
                         hurt to stretch?  Were you really on
                         fire?  Is it true that one of you can
                         fly?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Working on it.  And it's a lot harder --

                                   SUE
                         We don't know much more than you do,
                         at this point.  Which is why we will
                         be going directly to the lab, where we
                         can diagnose our symptoms and --

                                   REPORTER #2
                         Symptoms?  So it's like a disease?

               Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt.  Ben is lost in
               thought, looking at Deb's ENGAGEMENT RING.  Johnny leaps in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Symptoms?  Please.  If having powers
                         is a disease, then yeah we got it. 
                         And we are gonna blow your minds. 
                         There's a new day dawning.  The day of
                         the Fantastic Four.

                                   REPORTER #3
                         That thing doesn't look too fantastic.

               The Reporter nods toward Ben.  Ben's fists tighten, the sound
               of rocks crushing together.  Reed feels the pain.

                                   REED
                         Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero
                         who's been through a terrible orde--

                                   JOHNNY
                         What he's trying to say is: every team
                         needs a mascot...

               Reporters laugh.  Ben turns his head away.  Reed burns.

                                   REED
                         Look, we went up to space to find a
                         way to understand DNA, to cure
                         disease, save lives.  Well, now it's
                         our DNA, our disease, our lives on the
                         line...
                             (a beat)
                         Thank you.  No more questions.

               Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.  The press waits a beat,
               then surges.  Ben spins, holding up one finger.  A giant.

                                   BEN
                         Be nice.

               The press step back, intimidated.  Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's
               FACE FREEZES.  It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in --

               EXT. BANK - DAY

               Establishing shot of a historic New York building.

               INT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               BANKERS sit around a table.  LAPTOPS hum.  The lead banker is
               power-broker NED CECIL.  The men keep their eyes on Victor.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Well, Victor, the bank would like to
                         congratulate you.  On the fastest
                         freefall since the Depression.  We
                         can't even give your stock away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ned, you know I can turn this around.

               Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You promised a cure-all, and came back
                         with this.  Who the hell's going to
                         invest in a biotech company that turns
                         its workers into circus freaks?

               Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS
               FLICKER, losing feeds.

               Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do
               that?)  He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.

                                   VICTOR
                             (pointed)
                         I really appreciate all your support.

                                   NED CECIL
                         You've got a week, Victor.  One week
                         to turn this around.  Or we pull
                         out...
                             (a beat)
                         This meeting is over.

               Victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we CUT HARD TO --

               INT. BANK - HALLWAY - DAY

               Victor and Leonard stride out.  Victor is writhing.

                                   VICTOR
                         Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know
                         preferred stock from livestock.

               Leonard is thinking all business.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir.  Reed's comments at that press
                         conference killed us.  How are we
                         going to turn this around?

               Victor considers.  His mind races, eyes narrow.

                                   VICTOR
                         Very simple.  I cure them.  If I can
                         cure these freaks, then I can cure
                         anyone.  What better way to restore my
                         reputation?

               Leonard nods, impressed.  Victor is a man in motion.  As they
               step into sunlight, we cut to...CLICKCLICKCLICK in --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               REPORTERS snap pictures.  A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping
               in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny and
               get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON,
               which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle
               position.

               COPS hold back the surging press.  Ben keeps his head down,
               self-conscious.  He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Smile, Ben.  They want to like you. 
                         Give 'em your good side.  Or your less
                         bad side.

               Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.  Stiff, tentative:

                                   BEN
                         Uh...don't do drugs.

               The kids FLINCH.  Ben trudges on.  Johnny smiles bright,
               doing hand-signs for F4.  Sue pulls him toward --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

               The Fantastic Four enter.  They are greeted by JIMMY
               O'HOOLIHAN, an old-time doorman with a kind smile.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr.
                         Richards.  All that for you?

               He motions to the flashing cameras outside.

                                   REED
                         I'm afraid so...

               He searches for the name.  Sue steps up.

                                   SUE
                         Jimmy.  Good to see you again.

               He smiles at Sue, then at Reed.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Good to see you too... Don't worry,
                         sir.  I know how crowded that head of
                         yours is.

                                   REED
                         Any visitors while I was away?

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Just the usual.  Told 'em you were
                         circling round outer space.

               He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK.  Reed looks
               sheepish.  He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue.

                                   REED
                         We had a tough year.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, nine years straight.

               Reed looks at Ben.  Thanks a lot.  DING.  Elevator doors
               open.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               They enter.  Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Twenty?  From outside the place looks
                         a lot taller.

                                   REED
                         Oh, it is.

               The doors close, but...the ELEVATOR does not move.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Either we're moving really fast...or
                         not at all.

               A digital readout on the panel: EXCEED MAXIMUM WEIGHT.  A
               sign reads: MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 2000 pounds.  They turn to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         I'll take the stairs.

               Doors open.  He lumbers out.  As the doors close behind him,
               he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The elevator rises.  Reed roils with guilt.

                                   SUE
                         How come Ben can't turn it on and off
                         like us?

                                   REED
                         That's what we're here to find out.

                                   SUE
                         If it happened to him, then it
                         could...

               Happen to all of them.  Reed nods softly.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Wait.  You mean there's chance we
                         could be full-on-24-7-fantastic? 

                                   SUE
                         Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run
                         around on fire for the rest of your
                         life?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I
                         can't be the only one who thinks
                         this is cool.

               Reed considers.  But Sue cuts him short with a look.

               DING!  The elevator stops.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

               The elevator opens.  They step out.  They might be on the
               20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor
               sixty.  It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above -- 

               Reed leads them into another area filled with separate
               "apartments" and all the amenities of home.

                                   REED
                         We should stay here until we can
                         define the extent of our changes...

                                   JOHNNY
                         This place is deluxe.  You got cable?

                                   REED
                             (hearing Ben's FOOTSTEPS)
                         ...and figure out how to reverse them. 
                         Let me show you to your rooms.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

               The press has died down, but there are still plenty of
               cameras.  A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up.  Victor emerges, wearing
               sunglasses.  This time, the press pay no attention to him. 
               No cameras flash.  Victor tightens, and enters the building.

               INT. SUE'S ROOM - DAY

               Sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair. 
               She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a SCRAPBOOK.

               She flips through it.  It's filled with pictures of Reed and
               his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia
               globe.  She stops at a picture of her and Reed in COLLEGE.

               A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to
               see...VICTOR.  He smiles, standing at the door, watching her.

                                   VICTOR
                         God, I've been so worried about you.

               She notices the scar on his head.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, your scar --

                                   VICTOR
                         I told you, I'm fine.  It's you I'm
                         worried about.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --

                                   VICTOR
                         Please, no apologies.  I've arranged
                         for your things to be moved to one of
                         my condos.  You'll have round-the
                         clock care.

               He goes for her bag.  But she stops him.  A half beat.

                                   SUE
                         Thank you, that's generous, but I
                         think I should stay here.  With my
                         brother.  Until we get a handle on
                         this.

               Victor is not used to being rebuffed.  He gives a thin smile.

                                   VICTOR
                         Sue.  I think you should let my
                         doctors have a look at you.

               A tense beat.  Standoff.  Made more tense by --

                                   REED (O.S.)
                         Victor!  What are you doing here?

               They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand.

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm starting to wonder the same
                         thing... How much do you know about
                         what happened to you?

                                   REED
                         Not much.  We need to run tests to see
                         the extent of the damage.

               Victor pauses.  He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay.

                                   VICTOR
                         Well, let me know if there is anything
                         I can do.  We're all in this together
                         now.

               Victor shakes Reed's hand.  His GRIP is so tight that Reed's
               fingers STRETCH.  Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts
               her hand out.  He smiles, and shakes.  He heads off.

               Reed looks at his hand.  Shakes his wrist.  He looks at
               Victor.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY

               Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  Reed catches
               up.

                                   REED
                         Victor wait... I just wanted to say,
                         I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
                         planned --

               Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR
                         Didn't go as planned?  It was a
                         catastrophe.  You ruined the lives of
                         four people --

                                   REED
                         I ruined?  With all due respect, I
                         told you to abort --

                                   VICTOR
                         Abort?  Reed, I put my company, my
                         name, billions of dollars on the line,
                         and I will not let you make me look
                         like a fool --

                                   REED
                         Victor, if we could understand what
                         happened to us --

                                   VICTOR
                         I don't want to understand it.  This
                         isn't one of your science projects.  I
                         just want to fix it.  Fast!

               Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing.  Lights dim.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         There a problem, Vic?

               They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway. 
               Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body.

                                   VICTOR
                         No problem, Ben.

               He turns back to Reed.  Close, quiet.  Lights flicker.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Just pay your goddamn electric bill,
                         and get to work on a cure.

               Victor steps away, toward the elevator.  He passes Ben, who
               just smiles and waves "goodbye."  Before Victor's finger taps
               the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit
               responded to him).  Reed exhales, shaken.  Victor steps into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

               The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE.  He SLAMS his
               fist into a STEEL WALL.  The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING.

               Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC
               SHELL under the skin.  He stares at it in horror.  The dark
               surface pulsates with electric energy.  What is he
               becoming...?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               Sue works the controls.  Reed approaches Ben with an
               ELECTRODE NEEDLE.  He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but
               it SNAPS.

                                   BEN
                         You got a chisel round here?

                                   REED
                         If we're going to identify the source
                         of the mutation, we need to isolate
                         your recombinant DNA so we can
                         activate positional genomes.

               Ben looks to Sue for translation.

                                   SUE
                         We need to give you a physical, so we
                         know what got zapped.

                                   BEN
                         Well why didn't you say so?  You want
                         me to lift some weights or something?

               Reed shakes his head.  He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE.

                                   REED
                         No, just sit back.  We have a good
                         sense of your strength from the
                         firetruck.  We need to find the source
                         of your strength.

               He turns on the X-ray machine.  The graph shows SOLID ROCK. 
               The rays don't penetrate.  Sue and Reed look confused.

                                   BEN
                         How bad is it?  You know I used to
                         smoke.

               Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too
               short to wrap around Ben's arm.  Reed stands stumped.  He
               looks at his tray full of instruments.  He picks up the
               little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER.  But it looks miniscule compared
               to Ben.

               Reed has an idea.  He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS. 
               He pulls of a real HAMMER.  He approaches Ben.

                                   REED
                         Okay, this might smart a little.

               He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS!  SLAMMING
               UP!  RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS!  The ultimate kick in the
               crotch.  Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK,
               wincing.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                             (high-pitched voice)
                         We'll...continue this later.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe
               Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  Flames escape
               through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!

               Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000
               degrees Kelvin.  They are essentially taking his temperature. 

               INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look
               at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  Machines go
               haywire.

               His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot
               or two.  He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.

                                   REED
                         Back it down, Johnny!

                                   JOHNNY
                         I can go hotter!

               He won't stop.  Reed pulls a switch on the wall.  FOAM sprays
               out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames.  He stands there,
               covered in thick FOAM.  His body steams.  So does his temper.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You're really cramping my style here.

                                   SUE
                         You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter,
                         you're approaching supernova --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Sweet.

                                   SUE
                         That's the temperature of the sun.

                                   REED
                         Not only could you kill yourself, but
                         you could set fire to Earth's
                         atmosphere and destroy all human life
                         as we know it.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.

               Reed looks at the control panels.

                                   SUE
                         He cooked the equipment.

               Frustrated, Reed looks at the smoking system.  And we CUT TO --

               Reed and Ben sit in chairs, facing each other.  A beat
               passes.  Ben taps his fingers on the chair, making small
               DENTS.  Reed looks down at his clipboard.  A little awkward.

                                   REED
                         Okay.  I've uh, got some questions,
                         from Sue.  That she thought might be
                         better coming from me... Can you, you
                         know, go to the bathroom...like
                         normal...

                                   BEN
                         Yeah.
                             (a beat)
                         You don't wanna know the details.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --

                                   BEN
                         Not unless you want that clipboard

               Reed and Johnny now.  Johnny exercises.  Reed stands nearby. 
               Clipboard in hand.

                                   REED
                         Is there something about flames? 
                         About flaming, that you --

                         What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out
                         why we each ended up with different
                         symptoms.

                         Sue's easy to see through.  And Ben's
                         always been a hardass.
                             (a beat)
                         Why aren't you writing this down?

               Reed sighs.  It's going to be a long process.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LAB - DAY

               Reed and Sue, tables turned: Reed observes her through a
               prismatic device measuring light refraction.  He "sees" her
               through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature.  He's
               having a hard time concentrating.  He focuses on his work.

                                   REED
                         It's not "invisibility" per se. 
                         You're bending the light around you
                         with some kind of malleable force
                         field.  That's what you projected on
                         the Bridge.

                                   SUE
                         What about you?  You haven't eaten in
                         days.  How come you're never on this
                         side of the microscope?

               He tightens, uncomfortable with being center of attention. 
               She reaches for his arm, like a specimen.  He pulls away, but
               she sees a glimpse of BRUISES on his ARMS.  She slows down.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Bruises...from the bridge?

               He nods, rolls down his sleeves.

                                   REED
                         Have you had any side-effects, from
                         your powers?

               She considers.  A little vulnerable.

                                   SUE
                         I've had some headaches.  Migraines.

               A beat.  Reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.

                                   REED
                         You should be able to bend light
                         around other objects, even people, if
                         you could control your emotional state
                         better --

                                   SUE
                         Excuse me?

               She is annoyed.  Reed is oblivious.

                                   REED
                         I'm saying, if you had a little more
                         self control, you could locate the
                         trigger.  Can you remember the exact
                         emotions when --

                                   SUE
                         Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.

                                   REED
                         Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate
                         that feeling?  Some memory or...

                                   SUE
                             (staring right at him)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She looks at Reed, eyes narrow.  She becomes invisible.  As
               she focuses on Reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear FORCE
               FIELD forms around her body.  The force-field BENDS LIGHT
               around a MICROSCOPE, which goes INVISIBLE.  Reed steps out to
               ask...

                                   REED
                         How's that coming -- whoa --

               The FORCE-FIELD shoots in all directions, knocking everything
               over in a fifteen foot radius.  Reed is thrown from his
               chair.

                                   SUE
                         I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
                         do that... You must think that was
                         some kind of latent hostility or --

                                   REED
                         What in the world would give me that
                         idea?

               An awkward beat.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         I mean, you broke up with me, right?

                                   SUE
                         Are you kidding?

                                   REED
                         No, I distinctly remember: you walked
                         out my door.  Ergo...

               She didn't want to get into this.  She looks down,
               vulnerable.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  I was ready for the next step,
                         you weren't, ergo, I walked.

                                   REED
                         I think it was a little more
                         complicated than --

                                   SUE
                         I just wanted to share an apartment. 
                         What was so complicated about that?

               The question stumps him.  A beat.  He struggles.

                                   REED
                         There were a lot of variables to
                         consider --

                                   SUE
                         No.  There weren't.  There was you. 
                         And me.  No variables, no math.  It
                         was actually the simplest thing in the
                         world.  But your head got in the way...
                         like it always does.

               Her words penetrate.  He knows she's right.  He looks away.

                                   REED
                         Sue...I just...I thought...

               He struggles for the words.

                                   SUE
                         Same old Reed.  Too much thinking...

               He opens his mouth, but...WHAM!  Doors open.  Johnny enters,
               wearing a CHARRED SHIRT.  He points to the burned scraps of
               his shirt.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Okay guys, we have a serious problem.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

               ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from
               various closets/containers:

                                   REED (V.O.)
                         Our uniforms were exposed to the storm
                         like us.  So they can transform like
                         us, becoming invisible, changing size
                         on demand or remaining impervious to
                         flame.

               REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves
               in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  No boots, no gloves.  Not
               yet.  (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes).

                                   BEN
                         You look like an eighties rock band.

                                   SUE
                             (to Ben)
                         The suit will stretch.  You should try
                         it --

                                   BEN
                         I wouldn't be caught dead in that.

                                   JOHNNY
                         He's right.  These costumes are...
                         missing something.  I can't put my
                         finger on it --

                                   REED
                         They're not costumes.

                                   SUE
                         We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we
                         need to stay here till we've stabilized.
                        
               Johnny shakes his head, frustrated.

                                   JOHNNY
                         I'm getting sick of being trapped
                         here.  NASA wasn't even this strict!

               He marches out.  Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing.  Sue
               heads out, leaving Ben and Reed.  A beat.  Ben looks at Reed.

                                   BEN
                             (looking at uniform)
                         Maybe it's missing a utility belt. 

               Off Reed's dark look, we hear:

                                   VICTOR (V.O.)
                         So what's the prognosis?

               INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON: an X-RAY.  Victor's ARM.  The metallic
               transformation is higher now.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor
               and his DOCTOR.  In the wall behind them: ancient armor
               (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  It adds a little
               menace to the room.

                                   DOCTOR
                         Your tissue, your organs, your entire
                         biophysical structure is changing. 
                         Every system is still functioning,
                         somehow --

                         And they're changing into...

                                   DOCTOR
                         I don't really know.  A compound
                         organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than
                         titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than
                         diamonds --

                                   VICTOR
                         Like the shields Reed said would
                         protect us.

                         How long?

                                   DOCTOR
                         At this rate, the infection should be
                         complete in two, maybe three weeks --

                                   VICTOR
                         What do you mean "complete"?

                                   DOCTOR
                         I wish I could tell you.  I can't
                         pretend to know what we're dealing
                         with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --

               Victor hardens, razor sharp.

                                   VICTOR
                         What?

                                   DOCTOR
                         The Center for Disease Control.  If
                         this thing is contagious --

               WHHM!  Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look at me.  I have a life.  I'm the
                         face of a billion-dollar-company... We
                         need to keep this confidential,
                         understand?

               Victor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat.

                                   DOCTOR
                         But...this disease...is progressive...
                         degenerative...

                                   VICTOR
                         That's terrible news...

               With one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm
               into the doctor, killing him instantly.  Victor retracts his
               arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         ...but I think I'll get a second

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter
               Building, spending hours searching for the cure.  He checks
               charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.

               Finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where
               Ben's CHARTS are projected (both Ben and Thing's anatomies). 
               Reed wears the uniform under his labcoat.  He checks his
               equations over and over, making notes upon notes.

                                   REED
                         Nothing...nothing...nothing...

               He hits the end of the slides.  The wall fills with white
               light.  Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH! 
               Something FALLS off the end of the desk.

               Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face.  He steps
               over to see...a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered. 
               Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Of course...of course...the cloud...

               THE COSMIC STORM swirls, terrifying.  We slowly PULL BACK TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MAIN LAB - NIGHT

               The STORM is a computer-image on screen now.  Behind the
               screen are six chalkboards full of Reed's calculations and
               the scribbled beginnings of a MACHINE.

               We PULL BACK to see his arm stretched across the room writing
               on the end of another chalkboard.

               He's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic.  He
               hears...a CREAK.  He slows down, but doesn't look up to see
               SUE enter.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing?

                         particles are still charged.  With the
                         right amount of energy, those ions
                         could create the elemental profile of
                         the cosmic storm.

               He rifles through a desk drawer, then heads out.  Sue stands
               there, looking at the storm.  Concerned.  Then we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sue follows Reed.  He flips through a file, excited.

                                   REED
                         If we can build a machine to re-create
                         the storm, we can reverse the polarity --

                                   SUE
                             (realizing)
                         And reverse the mutations --

                                   REED
                             (talking more to himself)
                         Curing countless diseases, not just
                         ours.

               She looks at him.

                                   SUE
                         But we're the focus, right Reed? 
                         Reed...?

                                   REED
                         Of course.  Of course.

                                   SUE
                         And you sure you can control this
                         thing?  Last time didn't work out so
                         well.

                                   REED
                             (preoccupied, mind
                              spinning)
                         With the right energy, we can
                         stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into
                         the city grid...

               He keeps his head down, making notes, entering --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - STOREROOM - NIGHT

               Reed and Sue enter.  Reed is looking for something.  Sue
               slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam-packed with
               GEAR, GADGETS, BLUEPRINTS, INVENTIONS.  Awe-inspiring,
               overflowing.

                                   SUE
                         You really need to get a janitor.

               She stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         This must be what it looks like inside
                         your head.

               Reed finds his electron microscope.  He turns to Sue,
               defensive:

                                   REED
                         There's a system to it.

               She starts to pull out a MODEL of the FANTASTICAR.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Wait!  Sue, don't touch tha--

               The little car sets the whole shelf off balance.  A WAVE OF
               INVENTIONS COME CLATTERING DOWN!  Reed moves fast:

               He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF,
               pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND! 

               Reed and Sue hit the floor.  A close call.  Now more
               closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped
               around her.  A heated beat.  Their first real intimate
               moment.

                                   SUE
                         Sorry.  My fault.  I won't...touch
                         anything.

               As if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, Sue and
               Reed stand, backing off.  As they part, we see:

               BEN watching from the doorway.  Melancholy.  He disappears. 
               We slowly MOVE TO...A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in a VENT GRATE.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches a bank of videoscreens.  He has the Baxter
               Building under surveillance.  He sees Reed and Sue on
               monitors.  He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved
               hand.

               A door opens.  Leonard enters.  He sees the screens.

                                   LEONARD
                         Is Reed any closer to a cure?

               Victor looks at that image of Reed and Sue on the screen.

                                   VICTOR
                         The only thing he's closer to is
                         Sue...

               But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall. 
               He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to
               his will.  He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:

               REED'S BLUEPRINTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER.  Victor's
               eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Make me a reservation for two at
                         Cipriani tonight.

               Victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         And get this over to Ben Grimm.

               Victor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  As he gets
               closer, his screens go STATICKY.  He absentmindedly picks at
               his SCAR.  In shadows, we see skin peeling off.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Close your eyes, baby.  Keep 'em
                         closed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT

               BEN GRIMM stands front and center.  Not the Thing.  But BEN
               GRIMM.  A normal man.  He smiles wide, shaking his head.

                                   WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         You surprised?

               Now we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The
               Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old
               life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         Yeah I'm surprised.  Surprised the
                         fire department didn't shut this down.

               ON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a
               SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy. 
               On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together.

                                   THE THING
                         God.  I was good looking.

               We hear the party sing "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."  Debbie kisses Ben. 
               Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out
               candles.

                                   DEBBIE (ON SCREEN)
                         What did you wish for, honey?

                                   BEN (ON SCREEN)
                         I already got it.  Everything I want.

               As they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.  The tape ends,
               and he sits in darkness for a beat.  A long, lonely beat.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLS - NIGHT

               Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat. 
               As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:

               REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is
               STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just
               shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM... 

               UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The
               muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach... 

               REED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in
               his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES. 
               His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his
               skin.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Damn, Stretch!

               Reed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall.

                                   JOHNNY
                         How far's that rubber bend?

               Reed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring.

                                   REED
                         That's what I'm trying to calculate. 
                         And it's not rubber.  It's muscle,
                         tendon.  I seem to have the ability to
                         manipulate the malleability of my
                         molecular structure and redistribute
                         my density to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Right, whatever, have fun.

               And Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP.  It starts
               to POP in his hand, the bag swelling.  He casually turns on a
               TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES.  The Jiffy Pop swells, ready
               to blow.  He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the
               games:

               Cool stunts, hot girls.  Johnny's brow furrows, a thought
               forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT

               A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora. 
               Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Dark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A
               shadow emerges.  Ben.  He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a
               classic Brooklyn tavern.  Neon sign.  Music, life inside. 
               Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes
               through the door into --

               INT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT

               A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a
               place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He
               moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way.

               Ben reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH! 
               The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard. 
               Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.

                                   BEN
                         That's not funny!

               They go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out,
               scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar.

                                   ERNIE
                         Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first
                         mook from Brooklyn to go to outer
                         space, so pay him some respect!

               But the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary.

                                   BEN
                         Ernie.  Sorry for killing your
                         business.  I'll take the usual, then
                         I'm out... Better make it a double.

               Ernie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his
               head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the
               bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA
               MASTERS.

                                   ALICIA
                         Who killed the party?

               She turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack
               of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind.

                                   ERNIE (O.S.)
                         Make it a triple.  On the house,
                         Benny.

               Ben takes his drink, but SMASH!  His grip shatters the glass,
               spilling all over himself.  He smiles ruefully.

                                   BEN
                         If there's a God, she hates me.

               He grabs a bar-rag to dry off.

                                   ALICIA
                         I don't think She's real big on hate.

                                   BEN
                         You wouldn't say that, if you could
                         see me.

               She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.

                                   ALICIA
                         Can I...?  See you...?

               Ben doesn't say anything.  A little unnerved by this woman.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         It's okay, I won't bite...
                             (feeling his arm)
                         ...not that I could.

               She puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and
               gentle touch allows Ben to let her.  She smiles softly.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         Such a sad face... You know, sometimes
                         being different isn't a bad thing.

                                   BEN
                         Trust me, this ain't one of those
                         times.

               She smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.

                                   ALICIA
                         See you round, Benny...

               Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         I'm Alicia, by the way.

               Ben watches her disappear.  He sees a few people staring.  He
               lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new
               drink, in a steel MARTINI SHAKER.  He knocks it back.

               EXT./INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Lights twinkle.  A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs. 
               Heads turn, whispers flutter.  SUE steps out, joining...
               Victor at a prime table.  He pulls out her chair, wearing
               gloves.

                                   VICTOR
                         Thank you for coming out to see me.

               She nods, a little self-conscious.

                                   SUE
                         You said it was urgent.

                                   VICTOR
                         It is.  There's something we need to
                         talk about.  Something I need to ask
                         you...

               Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.

                                   SUE
                             (slow, careful)
                         Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I
                         want you to know I appreciate
                         everything you've done for me, but I
                         just don't --

                                   VICTOR
                         Susan.  What are you doing?

               He is cold as ice.  If he's hurt, he'll never show it.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         You think I brought you here to talk
                         about us?  Please.  This is business.
                             (leaning forward, intense)
                         I need to know: how close is Reed
                         to finding to a cure?

               She pauses.  Then:

                                   SUE
                         He's working round the clock.  But the
                         data needs to be tested, analyzed
                         before --

                                   VICTOR
                         Same old Reed.  All analysis, no
                         action.  Wasn't that the problem with
                         you two?

               She holds tight, keeping cool.

                                   SUE
                         If these molecules aren't stable, they
                         could make us worse, maybe even kill
                         us.

                                   VICTOR
                         Then why is Reed dragging his feet? 
                         Maybe he likes having his prize
                         specimen under glass...
                             (closer, cruel)
                         It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally
                         the perfect woman for him...because
                         you're his science project.

               The words sting.  She can't help but hear some truth in them.

                                   SUE
                         Please don't make this personal --

                                   VICTOR
                         Oh, I think you already have.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, we can't do anything until the
                         research is ready.

               Victor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX.

                                   VICTOR
                         "We," huh?

               Victor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard
               that he SPILLS water.  Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.  Victor
               gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Don't forget who you work for, Susan. 
                         So get to work.  And do your job.

               He walks out.  As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out
               of his pocket.  He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the
               dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.

               Sue sits embarrassed.  She slowly...disappears.  People gasp. 
               She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT
               through the air.  At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN --

                                   BUSINESSMAN
                         I wish my wife would disappear.

               The other men laugh, but WHHM!  The man's wine SPILLS into
               his LAP!  Sue walks out.  The restaurant is left buzzing. 
               Lights twinkle.  And we FADE OUT.  A beat.  Then we CRASH
               INTO --

               EXT. NYC ARENA - ESPN MOTO X GAMES - DAY

               The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills
               and ramps...where MOTO-BIKES launch into the air to the
               delight of 20,000 fans.  The Riders spin and flip, performing
               aerial acrobatics on their 250CC motor bikes.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have
                         a special guest for you... Johnny
                         Storm of the Fantastic Four!

               JOHNNY emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the
               crowd.  He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep.  He
               beelines to RONNIE RENNER.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, Ronnie Renner!  I'm a big fan.

               Ronnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by
               this circus freak.

               The other bikers approach.

                                   KENNY BARTRAM
                         Heard you like to ride.  Wanna take
                         her for a spin?

               He motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine.

                                   RONNIE RENNER
                         Come on, bro.  I'll teach you some
                         tricks...if you can keep up.

               We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO --

               INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY

               Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny. 
               Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with
               the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart. 
               Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER
                         A rock-solid double-flip!

               The CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the
               hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Look at that lift, ladies and
                         gentlemen!

               Johnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie
               tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump,
               and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Frontside 360!  He's totally flat and
                         whipped!

               He lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS
               his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning. 
               He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN!

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Whoa!  That's a...what is that?  A
                         720?

               Johnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the
               last hill.  He leans over his handlebars.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         He's going for a Kiss of Death!

               Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING
               STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And...
               
               JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to
               streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL! 
               LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A
               FLAMING BLUR!

               And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts
               to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling
               upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                             (hand over mic)
                         Is he......flying?

               A beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down! 
               LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing,
               maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny
               swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face.  What
               the hell just happened??

                                   X GAMES ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
                         Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! 
                         You've just seen the first...the
                         first...TORCHFLIGHT!  The McTORCH!

               A new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing
               ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike:

               THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles.

                                   JOHNNY
                         My bad.  Sorry about that.
                             (a glance to Ronnie)
                         Thanks for the lesson, bro.

               HOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a
               scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING

               Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses
               on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to
               disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as
               well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet:

                                   SUE
                         That's new...

               Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down,
               preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Have you read these...?  From all
                         over.  People want us to fight crimes... 
                         save their kids...solve their problems...
                             (no response from Reed)
                         ...when we can't even solve our
                         own.

               She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Reed.  How close are we to a cure?

                                   REED
                         No way to know.  Without more
                         tests, experiments.

               She considers.  Victor's words echo in her head.

                                   SUE
                         We're not specimens, we're patients. 
                         This isn't just another science
                         project to you, is it...?

               Reed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but --

                                   BEN (O.S.)
                         NO...NO...NO FREAKIN' WAY!!

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY

               CRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and
               Sue rush in.

                                   REED
                         BEN!  What?  What's going on!?

               Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES.

                                   X GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what can you tell us about the
                         outfit?

               REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is
               peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit,
               revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST.

               Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge
               18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Not too much, but I will say that it's
                         all weather and no leather.  Kind of
                         Armani meets Astronaut.

               Ben, Sue, and Reed stare at the wall-sized TV.  Mouths agape.

                                   SUE
                         He didn't.

                                   BEN
                         Oh, he did.

                                   SUE
                         What did he do to the uniform?!

               She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back
               his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.

                                   REED
                         He talked me into it.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         So what are your superhero names?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies
                         call me Torch.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about the rest of the team?

               Johnny hadn't really thought about them.  He spitballs:

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Uh, we call my sister the invisible
                         girl...the Invisible Girl.

                                   SUE
                         Girl...?!

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         That's easy to remember.  And Reed
                         Richards?  He's the leader.  So
                         what's he?  Mr. Fantastic?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader.

               Reed shrugs.  He doesn't hate the name.

                                   BEN
                         Could be worse.

               Case in point: a photo of Ben fills the TV.

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         What about this one?  What do you call
                         this Thing?

               Johnny smiles, looking right into camera.

                                   JOHNNY
                         That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would
                         have gone with The Rock, but it was
                         taken.  And "Thing" pretty much sums
                         it up.

               A LAUGH from the studio audience.

                                   BEN
                             (matter-of-fact)
                         Okay.  I'm gonna go kill him now.

               He turns to go.  Reed wraps an arm around Ben.

                                   REED
                         Ben!  Slow down a second and --

               He sees a photo of himself on screen.

                         Is it true what they say?  That he can
                         expand any part of his anatomy?

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Actually, between us, I think he's got
                         some problems staying rigid.

                                   REED
                             (finishing his thought to Ben)
                         ...wait for me...

                                   X-GAMES REPORTER (ON TV)
                         Which may explain why this woman's
                         not smiling.

               They put up a shot of Susan.

                                   SUE
                         I'm driving.

                                   JOHNNY (ON TV)
                         Dude.  That's my sister.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - DAY

               The Thing rounds the corner.  Sees a crowd of girls lined up
               near a red PORSCHE parked out front...with "TORCHED" on the
               plates.  Ben slows down, smiles.

               EXT. NYC ARENA - A LITTLE LATER

               Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in
               the line.  Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents. 

               Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone.

                                   JOHNNY
                             (looking around)
                         Where's my ride?

               The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED
               JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in
               front of Johnny.  The Valet timidly holds out the keys...

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         What the?!  Is that my --

               Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the
               license plate.  It rattles to the ground, face up.

               Johnny rubs the sting out of his head.  Looks up and sees Ben
               in the distance, dusting off his hands.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (shouting: to Ben)
                         You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.
                             (seeing Sue)
                         What?!

                                   SUE
                         You gave us names?  What are you, the
                         "face" of the Fantastic Four now?

               Ben marches up.  Hands balled into fists.

                                   BEN
                         It's about to be a broken face.

                                   REED
                         This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need
                         to be careful until we're normal
                         again.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What if some of us don't want to be
                         "normal" again?  We didn't all turn
                         into monsters like --

               Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.  Stops himself. 
               Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.

               Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the
               head.  Ben stops.  Turns around more shocked than hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Did you just --

               Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.  This time in the face.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Okay, that's it, tinkerbell!  You want
                         to fly?  Fly.

               Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps
               in the way!  Too late!  WHAMM!  Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO
               REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's
               fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet. 

               BAM!  Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a
               BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.  WHOOSH!  He
               leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.

               The crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop. 

               Johnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck
               begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he
               stands.  Heating up.  Both his hands are now flaming fists of
               fury.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's see if we can get blood from a
                         stone.

               He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them. 
               High Noon.  They start to RUN toward each other...

               When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM,
               stops them both in their tracks with just a look.  Like a
               mom:

                                   SUE
                         You two need a time-out.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Blockhead started it!

               Ben just stalks off.  The crowd clears, scared.  A PAPARAZZI
               snaps a picture.  Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens.

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry.

                                   SUE
                         Damn it, Johnny.

               She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk.

                                   REED
                         You need to control yourself and think
                         before you --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if
                         we got these gifts for a reason?  What
                         if we have some, you know...like,
                         calling?

                                   REED
                         A higher calling like getting girls
                         and making money?

               Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Is there any higher?

               Reed looks at him, disgusted.  Johnny waves to the crowd,
               hand flaming.  People SHRIEK, snap pictures.  Johnny smiles at
               Reed.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This is who we are Reed.  Accept it. 
                         Or better yet: enjoy it.

               Johnny steps into the sea of fans.  Reed stands alone.

               EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY

               Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.  Tries to catch
               up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Slow down...

               Ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  She catches up.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. 
                         He's always been a hothead --

                                   BEN
                         It's not him.  It's them.
                             (pointing to crowd)
                         I can't live like this.

                                   SUE
                         Just give Reed a little more time.
                         You know how he works -- analyzing
                         every little step before he takes
                         one --

                                   BEN
                         It's easy for you to be patient.

                                   SUE
                         No, it's not.  I thought I was done
                         waiting for Reed... We're all in this
                         together now, Ben.

               He slows down, gets closer, intense.

                                   BEN
                         Together?  Look at me, Susie.  You got
                         no idea what I'd give...to be
                         invisible.  Your nightmare...is my
                         dream.

               She opens her mouth, but has no response.  She doesn't know
               his depth of pain.  As he disappears into the alley, we CUT
               TO --

               INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               The news plays on the TV.  Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the
               screen on an image of...THE THING.  He turns to Victor, who
               sits with the rest of the bankers.  Cold, sterile
               environment.

                                   NED CECIL
                         This is how you "turn things around"? 
                         These freaks are on the front page and
                         your company's in the obituaries.

               Victor has a larger bandage on his face now.

                                   VICTOR
                         I have a plan to use their publicity
                         for --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Victor, stop.  The bank's lost enough
                         already.  This isn't a negotiation. 
                         It's a notification.  We're pulling
                         out.

               A cold, silent beat.  Victor leans forward.

                                   VICTOR
                         You need to look long-term here. 
                         Without risk, there's no --

                                   NED CECIL
                         Reward.  We all know the sales
                         pitch, Vic.  And frankly, we're
                         done buying... Gentlemen.

               He motions to his men.  They all stand.  Victor is the lone
               man sitting.  PUSH IN on Victor's face, his inner rage
               palpable.  A few quick surges of electricity emanate from his
               body.  This man is getting stronger, more electric.

               INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY

               After hours.  The floor is slick with water -- puddles in
               every direction.  Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator,
               heading for his car.  As he goes, the structure lights start
               to flicker.  Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by
               one, furthest to closest.  He looks around.  Unnerved by the
               darkness.

                                   NED CECIL
                         Hello...?

               A hanging beat.  Victor steps out from shadows.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                             (relieved, almost)
                         Von Doom?  Gave me a little shock.  No
                         hard feelings, right?  Nothing
                         personal.

               Victor says nothing.  Ned keeps going.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         You know, you could always move back
                         to Latvura, start fresh.

               He mispronounces Latveria, dripping condescension.

                                   NED CECIL (CONT'D)
                         Maybe that's where you belong, back in
                         the "old country."

               That does it.  A surge of electricity courses through Victor. 
               His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to
               THE GROUND.  The electric spark hits the water and...

               ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING
               LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric
               snakes), heading straight for Ned.  His eyes go wide.  And...
              
               NED IS ELECTROCUTED!  His body spasms.  THUD!  He slumps,
               dead.  Smoke rises from his body.  Victor stands, power
               swelling.

               For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL
               GLOW beneath the skin.  He remains scary calm.

                                   VICTOR
                         It's pronounced Latveria.
                             (looking down at the dead body)
                         This meeting's over, Ned.

               Victor walks away, the final lights going to DARKNESS.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

               Victor enters, still adrenalized.  He turns to the light
               switch, and the lights come on.  He approaches his screens,
               and the monitors flicker to life.  His powers are growing. 

               One MONITOR rolls the news.  IMAGES of the FANTASTIC FOUR. 
               Victor leans closer, and the VOLUME automatically goes up.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                         ...the Fantastic Four put on quite a
                         show last night.  They landed in every
                         major headline in the northern
                         hemisphere.  In related news...

               An IMAGE of VICTOR on screen.

                                   NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)
                         Reports have surfaced that Von Doom
                         Industries may be filing for
                         bankruptcy.  You may remember that it
                         was Victor Von Doom who...

               Victor turns away from the screen.  The volume goes down.  He
               focuses his eyes on REED.

               Leonard enters, stepping closer, seeing the faint flicker of
               VICTOR'S METALLIC SCAR.  His eyes narrow, concerned.

                                   LEONARD
                         Sir, is everything okay?  What
                         happened to your...?

               Victor keeps his eyes on the screen, totally engrossed.

                                   VICTOR
                             (under breath, seething)
                         Reed... He got what he wanted...
                             (looking at Sue)
                         Everything he wanted...he took from me.

               He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed. 
               A hard, deadly beat.  Victor's eyes narrow, zooming
               into...REED'S RESEARCH: SLIDES on the wall.  He zooms into
               key words:

               DANGER, UNSTABLE IONS, MUTATION, OVERLOAD.  And Victor gives
               a slow, thin smile.  A new plan forming.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Now I'm going to take it back.  Piece
                         by bloody piece...

               His fist clenches.  We hear METALLIC SFX.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal
               man could balance.  But he is not normal.  His arms are
               wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine. 
               He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...

               VICTOR overseeing a group of TECHNICIANS.  They are boxing up
               Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research.  Victor wears
               a bandage, covering his scar.  Reed eyes a glint of METAL.

                                   REED
                         Victor, are you...are you okay? 

               Victor turns away.

                                   VICTOR
                         Don't worry about me.  Worry about
                         yourself.

               Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.

                                   REED
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         What I should have done a long time
                         ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. 
                         This all belongs to me.

               Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.

                                   REED
                         But I'm not done with the machine --

                                   VICTOR
                         Which is precisely the point.
                         Analysis is over.  It's time for
                         action.  My men could have mass-
                         produced this by now.

               Reed shakes his head, defending himself.

                                   REED
                         Mass-produced?  This isn't a
                         toaster.  You have no idea how it
                         works.

               Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the
               intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE.  He points to parts:

                                   VICTOR
                         Re-create the storm, invert the
                         polarity here, reverse the mutation
                         there.  Don't talk to me like I'm some
                         schoolboy.  I've got the same Phd you
                         do.

               Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with
               his machine.  He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.

                                   REED
                         The storm needs to be handled exactly
                         right, or it could make our mutations
                         worse, much worse, maybe even kill
                         us...

               Victor slows.  Is Reed getting to him?  Or giving him ideas?

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         Victor, please.  We need time to
                         verify the data... We can't afford any
                         mistakes -- there's only enough ions
                         for two or three attempts.

               Victor considers.  He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle.

                                   VICTOR
                         Reed.  I'm not asking permission.
                             (a final verdict)
                         We'll build it, while you check the
                         specs.

               Victor walks out.  Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

               The SHIELDS slowly rise.  FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work.  They
               wear the VDI jackets.  Reed watches, worried.

               Sue enters.  She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI
               logo.  And she is deeply worried.  She steps over to Reed. 
               Sparks fly behind them.  Drills scream.

                                   SUE
                         Can I talk to you?

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY

               Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed.  Quiet, urgent:

                                   SUE
                         Don't let Victor push you into making
                         a mistake --

                                   REED
                         He was going to take away all my data,
                         equipment --

                                   SUE
                         Better than your life.  Victor's not
                         the one who has to get into that
                         thing.  We are.

               Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.

                                   REED
                         Which is why I'm working twenty hours
                         a day, checking every variable --

                                   SUE
                         Every variable but yourself.  You
                         don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in
                         your head like --

                                   REED
                             (finally losing it)
                         I'm not the only one in there.  I got
                         you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling
                         around in there.

               Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  A beat.

                                   SUE
                         So clear it out.  Get out of your
                         head.  Get out of here...

               He looks at her, knowing what she means.  Where she means.

               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

               Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,
               mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE
               GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.

                                   LITTLE GIRL
                         Mister, Mister!  Please help me!  My
                         kitty is stuck in a tree.

               She gestures to a tree next to Ben.  Looks up.

                                   LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                         Please save Miss Lucy.

               Ben rolls his eyes.  Looks up.  Considers climbing the tree,
               but thinks better of it.  He has another idea...

               Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap
               out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!

               The cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks
               out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands
               the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. 
               He just moves on.

               EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

               Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE
               SCULPTURE of his bust.

               He stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely
               rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the
               haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched,
               but...

                                   BEN
                             (under breath)
                         Eyebrows are a little big...

               A beat.  He stares at these images of himself.

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I figured the only way to get you here
                         was to stick that in the window.

               He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.

                                   BEN
                         How'd you know it was me?

                                   ALICIA
                         I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?

               He steps toward her.  But he sees...a PARTY in the back part
               of the gallery.  Ben pauses, a little insecure.

                                   BEN
                         I'm not really dressed for a party.

                                   ALICIA
                         Relax, it's casual.

                                   BEN
                         No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty... 

               She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --

               INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT

               WHOOSH!  A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at
               BEN.  Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING
               CHISELS for his cracks.  Intricate, intimate work.

               Ben enjoys every moment.  He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in
               the corner.

                                   BEN
                         Those yours too?

                                   ALICIA
                         My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into
                         stone.  I was wondering when you'd
                         walk by.

                                   THE THING
                         You know, you could'a run an ad in the
                         personals.

                                   ALICIA
                         "Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
                         rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual
                         relationship."

                                   THE THING
                         This ain't permanent.  My friend
                         Reed's working on a cure...I think.

               She gets closer, running her hands across his arm.

                                   ALICIA
                         Bennie.  You feel pretty good as is.

               Ben bristles.  He doesn't want to stay this way.

                                   THE THING
                         You don't know what it's like out
                         there.  Walking around like some kind
                         of circus freak.  People staring,
                         whispering --

                                   ALICIA
                         I wouldn't know anything about that.

                                   THE THING
                         I mean...

                                   ALICIA
                         Tell me.  When you grew up in
                         Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you
                         know?
                             (a beat)
                         You went your own way then.  You
                         didn't listen to people.  So why start
                         now...?

               As he ponders that, we hear a CROWD SWELLING on the CUT TO --

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Fans swarm JOHNNY.  He signs autographs, poses for pictures. 
               Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO.  A
               tinted window rolls down.  Victor's face emerges.

                                   VICTOR
                         Need a ride, Johnny?

               EXT./INT. LIMO - NIGHT

               Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.

                                   VICTOR
                         A few fans.  Hope you don't mind.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Gotta take care of the fans, right? 

               He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, I built my business knowing what
                         people want.  And right now, the
                         people want you.

               Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.

                                   JOHNNY
                         And we don't want to let the people
                         down now, do we?

                                   VICTOR

                         No we don't.  Which is why we need
                         to strike while the iron's hot. 
                         I'm talking action figures,
                         videogames, sponsors --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Videogames?  You serious?

               Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         You talk to Reed and Sue about this?

                                   VICTOR
                         Johnny.  Let's be honest here.  Ben,
                         Reed, Sue.  Good people, all.  But
                         stars?
                             (shaking his head, a beat)
                         I don't want to break up the band, but
                         you're the one they want.  Don't you
                         think it's time to go solo...?

               Victor subtly nods to the models.  They envelop Johnny.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Take the car for a spin.  Think about
                         it.  Is this the life you want?  Or
                         would you rather live in Reed's
                         lab...?

               The car stops.  Victor gets out.  He stands on the pavement. 
               As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny. 
               The door shuts, and...

               WHHHMMMPF!  The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!

               INT. HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

               STARS on the ceiling.  A VOICE drones about the galaxy.  In
               the LAST ROW, we find: Reed and Sue.  Reed is thinking about
               work.

                                   REED
                         I could get Ben to tap into the
                         Baxter's main power to generate enough
                         voltage --

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look
                         up.

               He slowly looks up.  The stars seem to calm him.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         Remember our first date here...?  God,
                         I was so nervous.

                                   REED
                         You were?

                                   SUE
                         Of course I was.  I'd read all your
                         papers on bioethics.  Some of them two
                         times just so I'd have something to
                         say to you.

               Reed smiles softly, thinking back.

                                   REED
                         You know, I bribed the projectionist
                         ten bucks to keep it open late?

                                   SUE
                         I gave him twenty.

               They laugh.  Sue looks up to the stars.  Quiet:

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         I didn't want that night to end.

               Reed looks at her.  Wrestles with a decision.  Then quietly:

                                   REED
                         Sue, you were right.  It wasn't
                         complicated.  I just wasn't ready to
                         be...to become...
                             (a beat)
                         You can be a little intimidating. 

               She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him.

                                   REED (CONT'D)
                         You always talked about how you liked
                         the kind of man who could approach
                         you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't
                         afraid to tell you what he wanted.

                                   SUE
                         I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted
                         you to be that man.

               Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                         When I walked out, I waited ten
                         minutes outside your door.  Ten. 
                         Waiting for you to come find me.

                                   REED
                         Why didn't you say something?

                                   SUE
                         That would have kinda defeated the
                         purpose.  And Reed...
                             (closer, emotional)
                         I'm saying it now.

               Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their
               faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue
               disappears.

                                   SUE (CONT'D)
                             (quiet, playful)
                         Come find me.

               Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...

                                   SUE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft,
               tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT

               Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns. 
               A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips
               her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal.

                                   ALICIA
                         Look around.  I'll get us drinks. 
                         They always let blind girls cut the
                         line.

               She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves. 
               The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is
               the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling
               hard.

               Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained
               smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here. 
               He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.
               
               Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him,
               thinking he's just an inanimate statue.

                                   PATRON
                         I don't know about this one.  It lacks
                         a certain...realism.

               Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN
               GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         She's always had a thing for runaways
                         and strays, but this is ridiculous.

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #2
                         I know.  Did she really think these
                         sculptures would sell?

                                   BOHEMIAN GIRL #1
                         Like anybody would want this thing in
                         their house.  That girl's a one-woman
                         charity.

               Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the
               room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He
               glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten
               seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning. 

               We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging
               where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for
               him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his
               heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance. 

               THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --

               EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT

               A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN
               sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight. 
               Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a
               metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then...

                                   VICTOR (O.S.)
                         This seat taken?

               Ben turns to see...VICTOR.

                                   BEN
                         What are you doing here?

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm worried about you.

                                   BEN
                         About me?  How sweet.

                                   VICTOR
                         Come on.  Let me buy you something to
                         eat.  Looks like you could use the
                         company.

               Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat.

               INT. DINER - LATER

               Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a
               foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge
               plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other
               customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles
               the plates.

                                   THE THING
                         'Scuse me.

                                   VICTOR
                         I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't
                         changed that much for Reed, Sue and
                         Johnny.  At least they can go out in
                         public.  But for you?  People staring.
                         Whispering behind your back...

                                   THE THING
                         If you're trying to cheer me up you're
                         doing a helluva job --

                                   VICTOR
                         I'm just saying, I know what it's like
                         to lose something you love.  To see it
                         slip away, and know it's never coming
                         back.

               The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.

                                   THE THING
                         Reed's gonna fix me up --

                                   VICTOR
                         For your sake I hope you're right. 
                         I'm sorry if that sounds a little
                         skeptical.

                                   THE THING
                         Skeptical...?

               Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure
               points.

                                   VICTOR
                         Look, he's a brilliant man, we should
                         trust he's working as hard as he can. 
                         You're his best friend.  So what
                         possible reason could he have for
                         taking his time?
                             (a beat)
                         I mean, other than getting close to
                         Sue?

               Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't
               help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO --

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  Reed
               turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN.  He
               sits waiting, scowling.  They stop laughing immediately.

                                   BEN
                         Yeah, I have that effect on people.

               The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete. 
               The Technicians are gone now.

                                   REED
                         Ben --

                                   BEN
                         Oh, you remember my name do you?  You
                         happen to remember what you swore to
                         do with every breath in your body?

                                   REED
                         We're working as hard as we can --

                                   BEN
                         Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.

               He motions to Reed and Sue together.

                                   REED
                         Come on, this is nothing.

               Sue looks a little hurt.

                                   BEN
                         Glad "nothing" could take you away
                         from your work.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I don't know if this thing'll
                         change us back or make us worse. 
                         I need you to be patient for a little
                         while longe--

               He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around
               it like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  Ben pushes Reed back.  Hard.

                                   BEN
                         Look at me, Reed.  Look at me!

               He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin.  He
               THROWS Reed back.  Reed slams down to the ground.

                                   REED
                         I am looking.  That's why I can't make
                         a mistake!  I've got to get it right,
                         and it's not right yet!  We need to
                         test this.

               Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed.

                                   BEN
                         I spent my whole life protecting you,
                         from the schoolyard to the stars.  For
                         what?  So you could play Twister with
                         your girlfriend while I'm the freak of
                         the week?

               Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back.  Reed slams
               into the wall, and stays down this time.

                                   SUE
                         Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it.

               She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields.

                                   BEN
                         Stay out of this Susie.

               As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben
               up like a python.  They struggle.  Ben runs back into a wall
               to shake Reed.  Their faces are close, heated.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Good thing you're flexible enough to
                         watch your own back.  'Cause you're on
                         your own now.

               Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go.  Ben walks out.  Sue
               comes to Reed's side.  He's bleeding.

                                   REED
                         I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop
                         him.

               She heads out.  Reed slowly stands.  He looks at the
               transformation machine.  It's not ready.  But...Reed steps
               toward it.  As he walks, his image goes grainy in --

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every
               step.  This is what Victor has been waiting for.  His screens
               flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull
               back.  He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE.  Hits a countdown. 
               And he grabs his UNIFORM...

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sue hustles down the long hall.  Ben turns a corner, passing
               the elevators, heading toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She gets
               there too late.  Doors close, going down.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Ben pounds across the lobby.  He sees Johnny coming in.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Christmas come early!  Check it out!

               He holds up an ACTION FIGURE of BEN: a horribly bloated body
               topped by a tiny pinhead.  Johnny pushes a button and --

                                   BEN ACTION FIGURE
                         IT'S CLOBBERIN' TIME!

               WITH ONE ARM, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall.  With his other
               hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches
               from Johnny's head.  The toy lodges into the plaster.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey!  That's a prototype!

                                   BEN
                         Go back to the drawing board.

               He strides away.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               DING.  Sue speeds out of the elevator.  No sign of Ben.  She
               runs into...JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny?  Did you see Ben?

                                   JOHNNY
                         Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm
                         done with this freak show.  I'm moving
                         back to the real world.

                                   SUE
                         Is that what you call it?  "Real"?

                                   JOHNNY
                         At least it beats living in a lab like
                         somebody's science project.

               This hits home.  Sue is quiet.  Johnny turns to go.

                                   SUE
                         Johnny, slow down.  Think.  You know
                         mom didn't raise us to --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Look around, sis!  She's not here.  So
                         you can stop talking to me like I'm
                         your little boy --

                                   SUE
                         As soon as you stop acting like one. 
                         Come on, you're smarter than this. 
                         You think those people out there care
                         about you?  You're just a fad to them.

               He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Let's try something new: you live
                         your life.  And I'll live mine.
                             (beat)
                         And just for the record: they LOVE
                         me.

               He strides into the night, leaving Sue alone.  A dark night. 
               The Fantastic Four is no more.  The family is split apart.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               The transformation chamber is up and running.  Numbers count
               down.  The storm swirls in the chamber.  Reed now wears the
               UNIFORM.  He opens the door:

               HE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF.  HE IS FINALLY TAKING
               ACTION.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor sits enthralled.  He leans forward, breathless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Reed gets closer.  His heart races.  So does Victor's.  A
               moment of truth for both of them.  REED STEPS INTO THE
               MACHINE.

               Reed looks up at the cosmic storm.  He opens his arms, ready
               to risk his life.  And...WHHHM!  He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION,
               RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO --

               VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               His screens GO BLACK.  He looks out the window to see...a
               flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING.  The tip of the Baxter glows. 
               The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

               Lights go haywire.  Sue knows immediately...

                                   SUE
                         Oh god, Reed.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Lights flicker in darkness.  The door rips open.  Sue lunges
               inside.  She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in
               the chamber.  A beat.  Did it work?  Then...

               Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND.  His eyes flutter back.  Dead...? 
               His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard,
               while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.

                                   SUE
                         What did you do, Reed?  What did you
                         do?

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches every second on his monitors.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

               Sue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED
               OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  One side of
               his face looks like it's MELTING OFF.

                                   REED
                         I can...make it work.

                                   SUE
                         Reed, stop, you need to rest your --

                                   REED
                         The power...I need...more power...to
                         control...the storm --

                                   SUE
                         You need a doctor.

               Reed loses consciousness.  Sue carries him out.

               INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Victor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands.

                                   VICTOR
                         More power...?

               He reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE
               AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON.  His powers growing.

                                   VICTOR (TO PHONE) (CONT'D)
                         Leonard.  Bring me our lab rat.

               EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Ben sits alone, looking at city lights.  A man without a
               home.  Without a family.  A hard beat.  HEADLIGHTS slash
               across Ben.  He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a
               LIMO.

                                   LEONARD
                         Ben!  They need you back at the Baxter
                         building.  It's...Reed.

               Ben considers.  Despite it all, he's a good friend.  And a
               good man.  As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC
               IN --

               INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

               LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS.  A young crowd dances and
               grinds to the beat.  Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF
               FLAME swirl around the ceiling.  We follow them to:

               A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. 
               He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get
               a look at his various parlour tricks.

               He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.  Closer.  Candles around
               them start to melt.  Beads of sweat drip down her face.

                                   JOHNNY
                         What do you say we get out of here? 

               She pauses.  And...a very LARGE MAN steps up.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         This your boyfriend?

               The Boyfriend doesn't look too happy.

                                   BOYFRIEND
                         Is that all you do?  Bar tricks and
                         stealing chicks...

               Johnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting
               it into a burst of flame.  The Boyfriend drops the glass,
               which SMASHES on the ground...catches the floor on fire.

               The boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out.

                                   GIRLFRIEND
                         What are you doing?!  You could have
                         burned somebody!

               The boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk
               off.  She turns back for one last comment...

                                   GIRLFRIEND (CONT'D)
                         You know, if I had your power I'd be
                         doing something with it, not wasting
                         my time doing cheap bar tricks,
                         hitting on some other guy's girl.

               Johnny looks a little embarrassed.  The couple leaves. 
               Johnny glances around.  His FANS look down, away.  He sees
               how quickly they can turn.  The crowd parts slightly.  He
               looks very alone.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               Leonard leads The Thing inside.  The ominous chamber sits
               with its door open.  Victor enters from the control station.

                                   VICTOR
                         Ben, come in.

                                   BEN
                         What is this?  Where's Reed?

                                   VICTOR
                         Where do you think?  With Sue.

               Ben looks at the flickering lights.  Suspicious.  Victor
               turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark
               room.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                             (quiet)
                         I'll take it from here, Leonard.

               Leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.

                                   LEONARD
                         Yes sir.

               Leonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben.

                                   BEN
                         What do you want, Vic?

                                   VICTOR
                         To help you.  I've run every test
                         known to man.  And they all yield the
                         same result: the machine is ready.

               Ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...

                                   BEN
                         Reed said it'd be weeks till --

                                   VICTOR
                         He also said we'd avoid that storm in
                         space.  And we know how that turned
                         out.

               Ben nods.  Reed was wrong before.  Ben gets closer to the
               machine, drawn to it.  He wants to believe, so badly.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         He couldn't generate enough power for
                         the machine to reach critical mass. 
                         Yet another mistake for "Mr.
                         Fantastic."

                                   BEN
                         And you can?  Power it up?

               Victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little SPARK
               around him.  The lights...?  Or his skin...?

                                   VICTOR
                         Yes.  I've found a new energy source.

               He keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course
               with ELECTRICITY.  It starts to build, sparking up his arm.

                                   VICTOR (CONT'D)
                         Tell me...do you want to be Ben Grimm
                         again?

               Ben keeps his eyes on the machine.  His dream is alive.

                                   BEN
                         Let's do it.

               INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

               The chamber doors open.  Thing enters.  He looks around this
               sterile box.  An animal in a cage.  Victor pushes a control;
               the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal.  Thing shuts
               his eyes.  He just wants to be Ben again.

               FROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation
               sequence.  As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in
               the lab.  Energy pumps into the chamber.  The storm swirls
               faster.  Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --

               -- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both
               hands...and WHHHM!  A countdown begins in the control panels. 

               SLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window. 
               The chamber activates.  The storm strikes hard.

               The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony. 
               Struggling violently inside.  To escape?  Extend the moment:
               Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes.

               EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT

               The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie
               glow.  Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of
               the Baxter Building.  The rest of the city lights dim
               slightly.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

               Reed lies in bed, weak, recuperating.  When the power surges,
               we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that
               someone's using the chamber.  He starts to get out of bed,
               straining to stand with every muscle left in his body.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME

               Sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications.  The lights
               dim.  Power failure.  She looks up...

               EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

               Johnny walks alone.  A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky. 
               He looks up.  His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes
               where it's coming from.  He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris,
               crackling with light.  The chamber rattles dangerously, as
               the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building. 

               And then it's over.  The light dies down...somewhat.  It
               still pulses along with the chamber.  The chamber door SLIDES
               OPEN.

               Beat.  And...BEN GRIMM steps out.  Not The Thing.  No more
               rocks.  BEN GRIMM.  Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN. 

               He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  He
               collapses.  He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.

                                   BEN
                         Oh my God... Th-thank you.  THANK
                         YOU...VIC?!

               Ben sees a SPARK in shadows.  That spark is...

               VICTOR'S ARM.  Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to
               Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY.  His skin is part
               flesh, part metal.  Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.

               HE IS DOOM.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Vic... What the...?

                                   DOOM
                         Everyone thought I was safe behind
                         those shields...

                                   BEN
                         Victor, the machine worked for me.  It
                         can work for you --

                                   DOOM
                         It did, Ben.  It worked perfectly. 

               Ben starts to realize...

                                   BEN
                         You planned this...?

               Doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from
               his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.

                                   DOOM
                         I've always wanted power.  Now I've
                         got an unlimited supply...

                                   BEN
                         And no Thing to stand in your way. 

               DOOM smiles, nods, stronger than Ben now.

                                   DOOM
                         Take a good look, Ben.  This is what a
                         man looks like who embraces his
                         destiny.

               Doom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying
               backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         One down, three to go.

               Suddenly, WHOOSH!  The lab door flies open.  Reed enters. 
               Doom steps back into the shadows.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Right on cue.

               Reed's eyes go wide.  He sees Ben crumpled in the corner.

                                   REED
                         Oh god Ben.  Are you okay?
                             (amazed)
                         You did it, you really did it...

                                   DOOM
                         No, Reed.  I did.

               Reed slowly turns to see...DOOM.  His body, his face.

                                   REED
                         Victor...?  What, what happened to
                         you?  What did you do to your --

                                   DOOM
                         Exactly what I said I would: I built a
                         better, stronger being.  And
                         outsmarted the great Reed Richards --

                                   REED
                         Victor, this isn't the way to --

                                   DOOM
                             (a dark smile)
                         You always know best.  So tell me. 
                         What happens when you superheat
                         rubber?

               Doom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through
               the huge window!  Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Doom looks out the window, smiling at his old friend's fall.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT

               DING!  The elevator opens.  Doom strides out.  He passes our
               friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.

                                   O'HOOLIHAN
                         Mr. Von Doom?  Are you oka--

               Doom casually SWIPES, sending him through revolving doors.

                                   DOOM
                         Never better, Jimmy.  And it's Doctor
                         Doom now.

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

               Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali
               watch.  He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't
               get a grip.  His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!  He falls like a
               SLINKY, out of control.  Half his body loose, half hard.

               He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.  He catches
               Reed's face, holds it close.

                                   DOOM
                         Why the long face?

               Doom whips Reed into the night.  As Doom turns, people cower,
               horrified by his face.  They clear out, and...

               Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic
               veins.  A monster.  Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with
               an iron fist, and bounds into the night.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

               Smoke billows, windows are shattered.  Sue races inside,
               seeing Doom's devastation.  Silence, deadly silence. 
               Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift.  BEN crawls out.

                                   SUE
                         Ben?!

               She helps him out of the rubble.  He is beaten, battered.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Sue!

               Johnny comes running in.  He sees the wreckage.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --

                                   SUE
                         No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.

               He nods.  A beat between them.  He looks around, sees Ben.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Jesus, Ben!
                             (eyeing him)
                         I go away, look what happens.  You got
                         a lot of explaining to do.

               He motions to the wreckage.

                                   BEN
                             (struggling, weak)
                         The machine works.  And Vic's gone
                         Mister Hyde on us --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Really?  With a name like Von Doom? 
                         Never saw that one coming.

               Sue looks around.  Only one question.  Dead serious:

                                   SUE
                         Where is Reed?

                                   BEN
                         Victor must've taken him.

               INT. VON DOOM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to
               the opening scene.  Those mysterious CRATES loom in shadows. 
               He wears a green HOOD, and METAL MASK over his scarred face. 

               Doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.

                                   DOOM
                         Chemistry 101, Part Two.  What
                         happens to rubber when it's super-
                         cooled?

               We now see what he sees: Reed sits in a chair with TUBES
               INJECTED into his skin FREEZING HIM SOLID!  Ultra-cold vapor
               coats him.  Doom steps closer, a sadistic smile.

               Reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Allow me.

               He PRESSES DOWN on one of Reed's fingers, which makes a
               horrific CRACKING SOUND.  Reed's face twists with pain.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Painful...?

               Doom seems to enjoy every CRACK.  He leans closer.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         You don't know the meaning of the
                         word.

               Doom lets up on Reed and reaches into a crate, and pulls out
               a military-issue ROCKET-LAUNCHER.  He aims at the city
               skyline, locking onto his target: JOHNNY STORM.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         But you will.

               Johnny's HEAT SIGNATURE glows.  The screen flashes: TARGET
               ACQUIRED.  Doom looks back at Reed, his launcher aimed
               casually over his shoulder.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Flame off.

               BOOOOM!  He fires without looking!  A MISSILE blasts into the
               sky.  THE MISSILE LIGHTS UP THE DARK NIGHT beginning its wide
               turn towards its target.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING

               Johnny, Ben, and Sue hear the missile being fired and turn to
               the window -- it BANKS, coming STRAIGHT for them.  They move
               to --

               EXT. BAXTER BUILDING BALCONY - NIGHT

               Johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the
               missile streaking closer.  As he moves, the missile SHIFTS
               slightly with HIS MOTION!  His eyes narrow, thinking.

               He FLAMES ON a HAND.  He waves his flaming hand, and the
               MISSILE locks onto the fire!  Johnny darkens, realizing...

                                   JOHNNY
                         Great.  Heat-seeker.

               His mind races.  He makes a decision, and steps up onto the
               ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.

                                   SUE
                         What are you doing --

                                   JOHNNY
                         Sis.  Let me take care of you for
                         once.

                                   SUE
                         But Johnny...you can't fly.

               Johnny considers, a half-beat.  He looks out.  Under breath:

                                   JOHNNY
                         Well then this'll be one hell of a
                         basejump.

               Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF
               THE EDGE!  He FLAMES ON!  The missile follows his arc.  As he
               drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                             (under breath)
                         Come on...come on...come on...

               He falls lower, lower.  And...he...BANKS!  SWOOPS UP! 
               FLYING!

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         FLAME ON.

               Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.

                                   BEN
                         We need to help Reed --

               Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.

                                   SUE
                         Ben, you got what we all wanted. 
                         You need to stay here.  It's too
                         dangerous.

               She heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless.

               INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

               Ben steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered
               window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat.

                                   BEN
                         What...what have I done?

               EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

               Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and
               turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More
               people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Eerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He
               hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom
               even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer. 
               And...

               A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being
               manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next
               to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm.

                                   SUE
                         What has he done to you?

               Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.

                                   DOOM (O.S.)
                         How romantic.

                                   SUE
                         Victor, please --

                                   DOOM
                         It's Doctor Doom to you.

               He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin.

                                   SUE
                         We know the machine works.  It worked
                         on Ben, it'll work on you.  We can
                         turn you back --

                                   DOOM
                         Do you really think fate turned us
                         into gods so we could refuse these
                         gifts?

               She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.

                                   SUE
                         Victor.  You always thought you were
                         god.

               Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.

                                   DOOM
                         Sue please, let's not fight.

                                   SUE
                         No, Victor... Let's.

               She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him
               back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up. 
               Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity.

                                   DOOM
                         Susan...... You're fired.

               BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back. 
               She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING
               to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her
               strength to...GO INVISIBLE.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Marco...

               A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Polo.

               He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to
               the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible.

               In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and
               out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through
               the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...?

               EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

               Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet
               behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots:

               A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast,
               Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge. 
               VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly.

               He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes
               in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit -- 

               JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles
               through the air, we CUT BACK TO --

               INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               From their vantage point, they see the missile explode. 
               Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.

               Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes
               every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes
               a CRACCCKKKKING sound.

                                   DOOM
                         One more down.  Now it's just the
                         scientist and his specimen.

               Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He
               has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips
               and get the words out.

                                   REED
                         Sue.  The only thing I ever knew
                         without thinking was...
                             (his lips fully freezing)
                         I...love...

               He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue
               whispers to him:

                                   SUE
                         Me too, Reed.

               Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.

                                   DOOM
                             (quiet, cruel)
                         And so four became none.  It's my time
                         now.

               BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH!

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Actually, Vic...

               Reed recognizes the voice.  So do we.  Doom turns to see... 

               BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING.  Back in rocky, fighting form.

                                   BEN
                         IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!

               Doom turns, just as --

               BAM!  Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever
               been hit.  The force sends Doom back through the air, toward
               the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V"
               sculpture.  It SNAPS, crashing onto him.  A few sparks.  Then
               nothing.

               Nothing at all.  No more movement.  Doom is dead.

               Ben turns to Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                         Damn, I've been wanting to do that.

               Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting
               the tubes from Reed.

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                             (Reed's words)
                         Victor's "not that bad," huh?  Just "a
                         little larger than life"?  Maybe
                         you'll listen to me next time before --

               WHMM!  The WRECKAGE shifts.  They turn to see...Doom EMERGES. 
               He stands, power coursing.  And he CHARGES at Ben!  Ben
               charges back.  And these two behemoths...

               SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!

               EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

               Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.  On the ground,
               PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.  Doom and Ben SMASH through
               the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

               BOOOOM!  Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the
               glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL.  People scream, run.

               INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

               UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD.  Their combined weight
               CRACKS the floor of the pool.  A YOUNG BOY watches underwater
               through his MASK.  Doom and Ben square off, but...

               The CRACKS OPEN WIDER!  And they're PULLED toward the HOLE! 
               WHOOSH!  The water is all sucked out of the hole.  The boy
               holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --

               INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall.  Roaring rapids
               head straight for him.  He jams his key into the lock,
               turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as
               the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to --

               EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

               SMASH!  Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the
               TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

               CRASH!  Water floods the street.  Doom and Ben land in a
               large GARBAGE TRUCK.  The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING
               from the inside.  Grunts, growls.

               CRASH!  The truck suddenly STOPS.  COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,
               sirens screaming.  And --

               BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.  SMASH!  Ben
               lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks
               the WINDSHIELD.  Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water
               flooding the street around him.  COP CARS converge on Doom. 

               Doom turns his attention to the cops.  His limbs SPARK with
               electricity, ready to fire at the cars.

               EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

               Ben sees the cops and Doom.  He knows the cops are dead meat. 
               He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.

                                   BEN
                         Excuse me, Maam.  Can I borrow your
                         car?

               She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.

                                   OLD LADY
                         The clutch sticks a little.

                                   BEN
                         Not gonna be a problem.

               Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.  WHMM!  It FLIES
               through the air, and WHAM!  Hits hard, knocking Doom back
               twenty feet!  As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

               BOOM!  Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!  CRASH! 
               Windows shatter.  The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,
               snapping the pole.  Doom steps out, unharmed.

               Ben CHARGES toward him.  Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY
               POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a
               giant STUN-GUN!  Electric sparks FLY through the air into -- 

               BEN!  The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!  He goes
               FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --

               WHOOMPF!  Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street! 
               Water rushes into the crater.  Ben lays there, incapacitated.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME

               On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.  Doom
               strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the
               death-blow.  Currents surge.  Right before he swings down --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         I can't let you do that.

               Simple, strong.  Doom turns to see...REED.  Alone.  Bruised
               and battered.  Slowly stepping toward him.  Doom smiles.

                                   DOOM
                         And you can't stop me.

               He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING
               DOWN!  Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.

               Something invisible.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         Hello Susan.

               She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. 
               Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It
               skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet.

               Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.

                                   DOOM (CONT'D)
                         What is this?  The pitiful three?

               Doom steps toward them, but --

                                   VOICE (O.S.)
                         Four.

               WHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a
               flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.

               Johnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of
               them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Had a little relapse, huh?

               Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.

                                   JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                         Welcome back.

               They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed
               and melted, making him look all the more menacing.

                                   DOOM
                         This is going to be fun.

               Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at
               the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a
               thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!

               He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He
               holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in
               buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. 

               He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of
               control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires
               SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move:

               Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. 

               Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges
               surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --

               Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-
               flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize
               fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field
               and --

               SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar
               starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! 
               They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- 

               Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is
               holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas
               holding the world.  People run out, safe.

               ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.

                                   REED
                         JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!

               Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the
               wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. 

               Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The
               impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed.

                                   SUE
                         Can't...hold...on...

               Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands,
               vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! 

               He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he
               forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.

               Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body,
               RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without
               breaking.  He strains, agonizing.

                                   REED
                         Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.

                                   JOHNNY
                         But all these people...

                                   REED
                         Now.

               Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting
               build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything.
               Johnny GRABS DOOM.

                                   THING
                             (quiet, smiling)
                         Flame on, kid.

               FLASH!  Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,
               which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed
               doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now.

                                   REED
                         Sue, I need some of that anger, rage,
                         frustration --

                                   SUE
                             (looking at Doom)
                         I'm sure I can come up with something.

               She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and
               the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.

               Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER
               BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which
               WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). 

               Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.
               Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it
               in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the
               point that it's blinding.  People look away.

               Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the
               ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her
               knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As
               everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And --

               DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body
               GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look
               devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed.

                                   DOOM
                         Is that the best you can do...?  A
                         little heat...?

               Reed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head.

                                   REED
                         Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101:
                         what happens when you supercool hot
                         metal...?
                             (to Ben)
                         Ben...

                                   BEN
                         Got it, teach.

               He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.  The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben
               kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays
               toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...

               The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and
               SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!

                                   DOOM
                         No.

               Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING
               DOOM.  GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling
               metal.  DOOM screams.  His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE. 

               The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely
               obscuring Doom from view.  A beat.  The steam clears to
               reveal:

               DOOM.  A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of
               METAL.  Frozen forever.  Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The
               Fantastic Four -- exhale.  They stand as one, in roiling
               smoke.  A beat.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Damn, I love this job.

               Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.

                                   BEN
                         Job, huh...?

               Will they accept their mantle?  Reed shrugs.

                                   REED
                         Well, we do have the suits...

               They give weary smiles.  A team.  Sue gets close to Reed.

                                   SUE
                         You know, about what we said up there,
                         I think maybe --

               THHM!  He KISSES HER.  His neck extending.  Strong, powerful. 
               He pulls back slightly, smiles at her.  A new strength in
               him.

                                   BEN
                         Funny how things turn out, isn't it?

               Sue looks at Reed.  A long way from that conference room.

                                   SUE
                         Hilarious.

               As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding.  The sun
               rises around them.  The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn
               of a new day.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

               INT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - BANQUET ROOM - DUSK

               Reed and Sue kiss on the deck of the Circle Line as it chugs
               around New York City.

                                   JOHNNY (O.S.)
                         Dude, that's still my sister.

               A PARTY IN PROGRESS.  Drinks, food, music.  We see in the
               crowd a familiar faces: O'HOOLIHAN (cast on his arm),
               bartender ERNIE, others.  JOHNNY and BEN stand behind Reed
               and Sue.

               Reed and Sue pull apart.  Reed turns to Ben, excited.

                                   REED
                         Ben, I've been crunching the numbers
                         on the machine.  I think if we can
                         rework the power settings...

                                   BEN
                         Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.

                                   ALICIA (O.S.)
                         That's my Benny.

               She hands Ben a big METAL MUG.  Ben takes the mug.  He
               CLINKS, but SHATTERS her glass.

                                   ALICIA (CONT'D)
                         We're going to have to work on your
                         touch.

                                   BEN
                         I like the sound of that.

               Alicia gets close.  A soft smile.  Reed turns to Sue.

                                   REED
                         Sue, can I talk to you for a second?

               Reed leads her out.  Ben and Johnny swap a glance.

               EXT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - DECK - DUSK

               A romantic view of the city-scape.  Reed stands with Sue.

                                   REED
                         I found a broken gasket, from space --

                                   SUE
                         A gasket?  Reed, we're at a party.

               He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just
               about the size of......a RING.  Sue slows down.

                                   REED
                         If one of us were to wear it...

               She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret. 

               Reed looks her square in the eye.  Unflinching.

                                   SUE
                         Reed.  What are you doing?

               Reed drops to his knees.  His head stays eye-level, while his
               body drops.  Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.

                                   REED
                         No more thinking, no more variables...
                         Sue Storm...will you...
                             (she's gone)
                         Sue?  Sue?  You there?

               Dead silence.  And then...

               THE RING DISAPPEARS.  SUE IS WEARING IT.

                                   SUE (V.O.)
                         Yes.

               Reed goes to kiss her.

                                   SUE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         That's my nose, genius... These are my
                         lips.

               Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible
               hands.  She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.

               INSIDE: the party applauds.  Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move
               through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.  As they go --

                                   BEN
                         No more cracks about how I look.

                                   JOHNNY
                         Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.
                             (weaving around bodies)
                         Clear the way, wide load coming
                         through.

               Ben glares, fists clenched.  Johnny smiles, mischievous, as
               they hit the balcony.  And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the
               air, blazing the NUMBER "FOUR" enclosed in a circle of flame
               (their future callsign), over the city skyline.  The crowd
               oohs and aahs.  Ben watches, unimpressed.

                                   BEN
                         Showoff.

               People drink, laugh, dance.  We slowly PULL BACK from the
               party, the boat, the city, and...CUT TO --

               EXT. HARBOR - DAY

               CLOSE ON: the MELTED FACE of DOOM.  He is placed in a wooden
               crate.  LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his
               cell.

               As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of
               ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.  Leonard's CELLPHONE goes
               STATICKY.  His eyes narrow.  Could it be...?  And --

               SLAM.  The door closes.  We can read the destination through
               stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.  And we pull back to reveal
               the box is on the deck of:

               A FREIGHTER SHIP.  The ship pulls away, steaming into the
               horizon, as we...

                                                       FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY

	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

	CREDITS  ROLL

	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913

	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY

	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

						PROFESSOR
					(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

						PROFESSOR
				"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

						BILLY
				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

						PROFESSOR
				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

						PROFESSOR
				Every five thousand years..

						BILLY
					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

						PRIEST
				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

						PROFESSOR
				"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.

						PROFESSOR
				"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

						PROFESSOR
				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

						PRIEST
				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

						PROFESSOR
				"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

						PRIEST (V.O.)
				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

						PROFESSOR
				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

						PRIEST
				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

						PROFESSOR
				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

						PROFESSOR
				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

						PROFESSOR
				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

						PROFESSOR
				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

						PRIEST
				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

						PRIEST
				Drink!

						PROFESSOR
				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

						PROFESSOR
				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

						PROFESSOR
				"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

						PROFESSOR
				Where is that boy? Billy!

7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor reads the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

						PROFESSOR
					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						PROFESSOR
				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

						PROFESSOR
					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						PRIEST
				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						PROFESSOR
					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

9	INT.  TUNNEL

	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM

	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						KOMMANDER
				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

						PRIEST
					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

						KOMMANDER
				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY

	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						PRIEST
					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						KOMMANDER
				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

						PRIEST
				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

						KOMMANDER
				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

						KOMMANDER
				When EVIL returns so shall we.

						PRIEST
					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						BILLY
				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						PRIEST
				No!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

						CLERK
				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						KOMMANDER
				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						KOMMANDER
				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY

	The huge ship's main hatch closes.

17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS

	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT

	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER

	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM

	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

						STAEDERT
				Don't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

						CAPTAIN
				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

						TECHNICIAN
				It's taking shape.

21	EXT.  SPACE

	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

						CAPTAIN
					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

						TECHNICIAN
				Hook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.

						STAEDERT
				...Send out a probe.

22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN

	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

						AIDE
				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						CAPTAIN
				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				Staedert, do you read me?

						STAEDERT
				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

						STAEDERT
				Perfect, Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

						STAEDERT
				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						PRESIDENT
				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.

						STAEDERT
				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						PRESIDENT
				Options.

						STAEDERT
				Wait or act.

						PRESIDENT
				Recommendations.

						STAEDERT
				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.

						PRESIDENT
				Gentlemen?

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				So do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod "yes"

						PRESIDENT
				All right, then! Staedert?

						PRIEST (O.S.)
				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						PRESIDENT
				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

						PRIEST
				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I'm listening.

						CORNELIUS
				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

						PRESIDENT
					(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

						CORNELIUS
				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

	Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.

26	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						STAEDERT
				Mr. President, we're at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.

						PRESIDENT
				Your theory is interesting Father but
				I don't think we have time to go into it
				right now!

						CORNELIUS
				Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				That's exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
				fellow citizens! General?
				You may fire when ready.

	All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.

29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					(consulting new data)
				Its structure has just solidified on the surface,
				 as if the object felt something.  If that's the case,
				we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

						CORNELIUS
				The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.

						CAPTAIN
				...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.

						PRESIDENT
					(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.

						STAEDERT
					(cold)
				I don't, Mr. President.

30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Staedert looks worried.

						STAEDERT
				Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
				shield protection.

						CAPTAIN
				Yes, Sir.

	The President is growing ever more worried.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you
				destroy it?

						STAEDERT
				I'm about to, Mr. President.

32	EXT.  SPACESHIP

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

						SCIENTIST
				The planet's diameter has greatly
				increased and it's moving toward the ship.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?

						STAEDERT
					(worried)
				...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

						CAPTAIN
				Nothing, General.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

						STAEDERT
					(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

33	INT.  APARTMENT

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						KORBEN
					(on the phone)
				Yeah?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

						KORBEN

					(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

						FINGER (V.O.)
				I love you too Major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.

				I was talking to the cat.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

						KORBEN
				At least, the cat comes back.

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(ironical)
				You still pining for that two timing bitch.
				Forget her.
				There are a million women out there.

						KORBEN
				I don't want a million - I just want
				one.  A perfect one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Don't exist bud.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						KORBEN
				I just found a picture of you.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How do I look?

						KORBEN
				Like shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:
	WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				 Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.

						KORBEN
					(sighs)
				I don't need one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				I know how you drive.

						KORBEN
				Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How many points you got left on your
				license?

						KORBEN
					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the

				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

						CORNELIUS
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						PRESIDENT
				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

						CORNELIUS
				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

	The President's nerves quiver.

				Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at

						KORBEN
				Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge

						MUGGER
				The cash man!

						KORBEN
				Been here long?

						MUGGER
				Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow

				Neuro charged assault model?

						MUGGER
					(off balance)
				Uh..

						KORBEN
				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

						MUGGER
				It's not?

						KORBEN
				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

						MUGGER
				Thanks..

						KORBEN
				You're welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

						KORBEN
				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

						MUNRO
				This is all that survived?

						MACTILBURGH
				Actually only one cell survived..

						MUNRO
				Have you identified it?

						MACTILBURGH
				It's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

						MUNRO
				Talk English Doc.

						MACTILBURGH
				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

						MUNRO
				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						MACTILBURGH
				Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in

screen.

						MACTILBURGH
					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

						MACTILBURGH
				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

						MUNRO
				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

						DOCTOR
				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

						MACTILBURGH
					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

						MUNRO
					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

						ASSISTANT
				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

						MACTILBURGH
					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

						ASSISTANT
				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

						MACTILBURGH
				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

						MACTILBURGH
					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

						MUNRO
				...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

						GIRL
					(very angry)
				Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra

					(worried)
				What's she saying?

						MACTILBURGH
					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

						MACTILBURGH
				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

						MUNRO
					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

						MACTILBURGH
					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

						GIRL
					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

						MUNRO
					(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						CHIEF
					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

						COP
				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our

all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						VOICE / KORBEN
				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

						GIRL
				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

						KORBEN
					(obeying)
				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

						GIRL
					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can't resist her plea.

						KORBEN
				Don't put me in this position...
				I can't... I'm late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

						KORBEN
				Finger's gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						KORBEN
				I hate when people cry...
				I got no defense...

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAY

	Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. Except the
dead-end he's just come up against.

						GIRL
				Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

						KORBEN
				It there's one thing I don't need advice on,
				it's how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

						COP
				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET

	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

						KORBEN
				We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				...Priest...

						KORBEN
				You're not that bad... Come on we'll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

						KORBEN
				Vito Cornelius?

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

61	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door opens. Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms.

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

						CORNELIUS
					(tired)
				Weddings are one floor down.
				Congratulations.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				She's not my bride, she's my fare.
				She's looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

						CORNELIUS
					(curious)
				That's me.  But I don't know who she is...
				where did you find her?

						KORBEN
				She dropped in on me... holding this.

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

						CORNELIUS
					(staggered)
				The fifth element.

	He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks
around helpless.

						KORBEN
					(sighing)
				Finger's gonna kill me...

62	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

						CORNELIUS
					(with a start)
				Who are you?

						KORBEN
				I brought the girl remember?

						CORNELIUS
				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

						KORBEN
				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

						CORNELIUS
					(eyes riveted on her)
				He's a she!

						KORBEN
					(bemused)
				You noticed...

						CORNELIUS
					(face shining)
				There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

						KORBEN
				So you do know her.

						CORNELIUS
				Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						KORBEN
				Perfect...

63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

						CORNELIUS
				It's a miracle!!!

						DAVID
					(worried)
				What is?

						CORNELIUS
					(babbling crazily)
				I can't wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT

	Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

						GIRL
					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				I'm sorry, it's just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

						KORBEN
				You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven't been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll
				need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

						DAVID
				Father, will you please explain what's
				going on?

						CORNELIUS
				The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,

66	INT.  LIVING ROOM

						KORBEN
				...What's your name?

						GIRL
					(after a moment)
				Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
				Ekbat De Sebat.

						KORBEN
					(polite)
				Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

						GIRL
				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

						KORBEN
				That's... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

						CORNELIUS
				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

						LEELOO
				Corn-i-Lius?

						CORNELIUS
					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

						DAVID
				Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

						CORNELIUS
				Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

						KORBEN
				They all like this in your family, father?

						CORNELIUS
				She's an exception..

						CORNELIUS
				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

						KORBEN
				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

						KORBEN
				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she's better?

						CORNELIUS
				She's fine, really..don't you worry..
				just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

						KORBEN
				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

						CORNELIUS
				It means, "Never without my permission".

						KORBEN
				That's what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

						KORBEN
				...Thanks.

	Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

				Fuck you!

						KORBEN
				...Thanks... You, too.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

66B	INT.. KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in
the air.

						KORBEN
				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

						KORBEN
				Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way

				can't resist..

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(suspicious)
				So, just how big was this fare?

						KORBEN
				5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin...

	Korben takes out a cigarette.

68	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

						DAVID
				What's she doing?

						CORNELIUS
				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She's been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						CORNELIUS
				What're you laughing about?

						LEELOO
					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						DAVID
					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						CORNELIUS
					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

						LEELOO
				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

						CORNELIUS
				The case was stolen?

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

	CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

						RIGHT ARM
				Excuse me sir, the council is worried about

				it would be possible to fire 500...

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

						ZORG
				Fire 1000.

						RIGHT ARM
				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						RIGHT ARM
				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

70	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						CORNELIUS
				There was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art
				dealer ... Asking all these questions about
				the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think
				anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so
				bad with names...

						DAVID
					(to Leeloo, timid)
				I didn't know your size.

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

						DAVID
				They really made her...

						CORNELIUS
				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

						LEELOO
					(to David)
				Domo danko!

	David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo?  The Stones...
				We must get them back.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						LEELOO
				Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

						CORNELIUS
				You know exactly where they are!

71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

						ZORG
					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

						ZORG
				...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

						ZORG
				That's better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You're warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

						ZORG
				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

						ZORG
					(very fast)
				...It's light... the handle's adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

						ZORG
				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it's even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

						ZORG
				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

						ZORG
					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

						ZORG
				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT's hands.

						ZORG
				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

						ZORG
				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

72	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

						CORNELIUS
					(astonished)
				What do you mean empty?

73	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

						ZORG
				Alright..I've got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

74	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

						CORNELIUS
					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She's supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She's looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

						LEELOO
				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

						DAVID
				Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation

	Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

						CORNELIUS
				...We're saved!

75	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

						ZORG
				I'm fucked!

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						AKNOT
				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

						ZORG
					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT's men grow edgy.

						AKNOT
					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

						ZORG
					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

						ZORG
				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
				ZERO CRATES!!!
					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we're outta here.

	AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

						AKNOT
					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

76	EXT.  OUTSIDE  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.

						ZORG
				I don't like warriors!  They're too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.
				Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when
				he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.

77	INT.  HALLWAY  ZORG'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

	The warriors have all taken a weapon. One of them inspects his ZF1.  He
turns it over and notices the little red button. He presses it.

	The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  Korben ignores it.

						THAI
				Not going to open?

						KORBEN
				I've never gotten a message that wasn't
				bad news.

						THAI
				How someone strong like you scared from

				The last two messages I got?  The first one

				And the second was from my lawyer telling me
				he was leaving too... with my wife.

						THAI
				You right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				Grandfather say: "It never rain every day."
				This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

	Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						THAI
				...You're fired. Oh!

	Korben smiles at him.

						KORBEN
				At least I won lunch.

						THAI
				Good philosophy..see good in bad..

						ZORG
				Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...
				nice to see you again

						CORNELIUS
				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						ZORG
				I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you're going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

						CORNELIUS
				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

						ZORG
				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

						CORNELIUS
				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

						ZORG
				Why?  What's wrong with me?

						CORNELIUS
				...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

						ZORG
				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

						ZORG
				...would you like a drink?

						CORNELIUS
				No thank you.

						ZORG
				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						ZORG
				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

						ZORG
				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						ZORG
				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

						CORNELIUS
				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						ZORG
				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

						ZORG
				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

						CORNELIUS
				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						ZORG
				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

						CORNELIUS
					(mocking)
				Where's the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

						CORNELIUS
				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

						ZORG
				You saved my life... So, I'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

						CORNELIUS
				You are a monster, Zorg!

						ZORG
					(complimented)
				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

						ZORG
				...Torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but I want
				those Stones. You have an hour.

	MUNRO enters the office just as a cockroach crawls onto the desk.
There's a small antenna on its back.

107	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Zorg's Right Arm wears earphones, monitoring the President's conversation
with the cockroach-spy.

108	INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE / SMALL ROOM

						MUNRO
				I managed to contact the Mondoshawan.
				They deplore the incident, but accept our
				apologies.

						PRESIDENT
					(relieved)
				And the Stones?  Did you find them in the
				wreckage?

						MUNRO
				The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.

						PRESIDENT
					(surprised)
				...What do you mean?

	The President is all ears.

	So is Zorg's Right Arm.

						MUNRO
				The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the
				human race..they felt we're too unpredictable..
				so they gave up the Stones to somebody they
				do trust. Her name is Plavalaguna. She's a Diva
				and she's going to sing at the charity ball on
				Fhloston Paradise in a few hours.  She has the
				Stones with her.

	The President breathes easier.

	Zorg's Right Arm is delighted.

						PRESIDENT
					(taking off a shoe)
				Excellent!

	The President crushes the cockroach with his shoe.

	Right Arm's earphones fly off his head. Good-bye eardrums.

109	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT
				I want your best man on this!

						MUNRO
				Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.

110	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	C.U. The most disgusting dessert ever made.  Korben looks at it shimmying
on a plate as the Thai serves it to him proudly.

						THAI
				Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

	Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The
phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Saved by the bell.

	Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

						KORBEN
				...Hello?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in
				this stinking City!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Hi Ma...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You wouldn't even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				Know something? The whole thing makes
				me sick!

	The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second
match..

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

						KORBEN
					(to the Thai)
				Go on... This is gonna take a while!

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

						KORBEN
				Other than that... You all right?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				...And now you're making fun of me?
				I'm warning you! If you don't take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, I'll
				never forgive you!!

	The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking
				about?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I get it! You want to make me beg,
				is that it?

						KORBEN
				All I want is an explanation! I just got
				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

						KORBEN
				Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.
				Someone would have notified me.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				They've been blaring out your name on
				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

						KORBEN
				Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

						MUNRO
					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						KORBEN
				What mission?

						MUNRO
				To save the world.

						KORBEN
				Where have I heard this song before?

						MUNRO
				You're to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions'?

						KORBEN
					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

						MUNRO
				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						MUNRO
				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						KORBEN
				And the third one?

						MUNRO
				You're the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

						MUNRO
				Don't you open your messages?

						KORBEN
				I've had enough good news for today

						MUNRO
					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

						KORBEN
				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

						MUNRO
				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

						KORBEN
					(sarcastic)
				You couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						MUNRO
				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						KORBEN
				I'm not going.

						MUNRO
				Why not?

						KORBEN
				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL

	Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the
card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	The doorbell rings.

						KORBEN
				...Scuse me.

	Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.
	Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

						KORBEN
				...Shit!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

						KORBEN
				It's my wife.

						MUNRO
				I thought you were divorced.

						KORBEN
				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates
				you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's
hands.

						KORBEN
				...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
				It'll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I'll be back.

						MUNRO
				Three of us will never fit in there!

						KORBEN
					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by Cornelius.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				I suppose that means "Hi" ?

						CORNELIUS
				I'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

						KORBEN
				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						CORNELIUS
				We're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

						KORBEN
				What kind of mission?

						CORNELIUS
					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

						KORBEN
					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

						CORNELIUS
				Of course.

						KORBEN
				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry..

						VOICE
				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING

	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

						VOICE
				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

						CORNELIUS
				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

						CORNELIUS
				What are you doing?

						KORBEN
				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

						VOICE
				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it
transparent.

						COP 1
				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

						COP 1
					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

						KORBEN
				No, I'm a meat popsicle.

						COP 3
					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

						COP 1
				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

						NEIGHBOR
				Fuck you!!

113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

						KORBEN
				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

114	INT.  HALL

	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

						COP
				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

						COP (O.S.)
				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

						RIGHT ARM
					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

						RIGHT ARM
				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's
name.

						RIGHT ARM
				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

						ZORG
				Don't come back without the Stones.

116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

						KORBEN
				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						KORBEN
			..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						LEELOO
					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

						KORBEN
				Uh..you're welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

						KORBEN
				Coffee!  That's what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						KORBEN
				With some honey!  You'll see, honey's
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						KORBEN
				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

						KORBEN
					(nervously)
				I've got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

						KORBEN
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						KORBEN
				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

						KORBEN
				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

						KORBEN
				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						KORBEN
				It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						KORBEN
				You hear that?

						LEELOO
					(licking)
				Cornelius..

						KORBEN
				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						LEELOO
				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

						KORBEN
				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

						LEELOO
					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

						CORNELIUS
				No, I'm not proud of myself...
				But we don't have the luxury of choice.

117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

118	INT.  SHED

	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

						AKANIT
				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

						AKNOT
				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He'll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

119	INT.  KORBEN'S APARTMENT  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

						KORBEN
				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

						KORBEN
				Yeah?

						MOTHER (V.O)
				Have you pulled yourself together?

						KORBEN
				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

						KORBEN
				I'll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

						CORNELIUS
				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

						CORNELIUS
				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

						LEELOO
				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

						CORNELIUS
				I can't pretend to be your husband...
				David's in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE

	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

						KORBEN
					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

						DAVID
					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

						KORBEN
					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David's fake ID.

						KORBEN
				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(looking at Leeloo's ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

						KORBEN
				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

						LEELOO
					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

						KORBEN
				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I'll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It's our honeymoon. We're going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

	ANGLE ON:

	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

						COP
					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she's also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

	ANGLE ON:

	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

						NEIGHBOR
					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that's me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

						NEIGHBOR
				We'll be right back ... we're gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

						ROBOT
				The same?

						CORNELIUS
				Yeah...

						DAVID (V.O.)
				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

						CORNELIUS
				Where's Leeloo?

						DAVID
				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

						CORNELIUS
				It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...
				It's my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

						CORNELIUS
				Here's the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

						NEIGHBOR
					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

						COP
					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

	ANGLE ON:

	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE

	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

123	INT.  HALL

	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

						STEWARDESS
				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

						KORBEN
				Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.
				I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

						STEWARDESS
				Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc
				Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

						KORBEN
					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ.

						LOC RHOD
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

						KORBEN
					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

						LOC RHOD
				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						LOC RHOD
				...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  And from what I'm looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						KORBEN
				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						LOC RHOD
				Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

						LOC RHOD
				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						LOC RHOD
				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your
				voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

						KORBEN
					(pissed)
				I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						LOC RHOD
					(petrified)
				Crystal.

124	INT.  AIRPORT

	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	Right Arm's smile shatters.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I'm the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

						RIGHT ARM
				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						RIGHT ARM
					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that's all... I'm calm now.

125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY

	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she
is doing.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				I'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I've got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

						LEELOO
				Love...

						KORBEN
				Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

						LEELOO
					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						KORBEN
				Sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						LEELOO
					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						KORBEN
				Know what? On that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

	ANGLE ON:

	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	ANGLE ON:

						LEELOO
					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

						KORBEN
				Finished what?

						LEELOO
				Learning language.

						KORBEN
				Which one?

						LEELOO
				All 900.

	Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

						KORBEN
				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						LEELOO
					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						KORBEN
				I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how
				to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

						LEELOO
				Apipoussan!

						KORBEN
				Apipoussan?

						LEELOO
				Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

						KORBEN
					(fumbling)
				Uh...

						LEELOO
				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						STEWARDESS
				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						STEWARDESS 2
				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						LOC RHOD
					(hugging her)
				I don't want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

						STEWARDESS 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

						LOC RHOD
				Now you're talking!

126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

	Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

						STEWARDESS 1
				Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.

						PILOT
					(checking her out)
				Thanks, Miss.

	The Stewardess leaves with a smile.  A red light flashes on the vast
control panel.

						MECHANIC
				Tell the ground crew we've got parasites
				in the landing gear.

127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY

	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

						RIGHT ARM
				Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				I'm listening.

						RIGHT ARM
				The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!
				He took my place.

						ZORG
				This is a joke, right?

129	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

						LOC RHOD
				No!! I swear to God! I've never been this
				sincere with a human before!

130 EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
	into the opening.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				You're fueled and ready to go.
				Have a nice flight.

131	INT.  SHUTTLE

						PILOT
					(to copilot)
				Everything ready for liftoff?

132	INT.  CABIN

						STEWARDESS
					(weakly, to Loc Rhod)
				No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...

133	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE / AIRPORT  HALL

						ZORG
				I cannot hear you. We have a bad
				connection here.  What's your number?

	Right Arm reads off the phone number.

						RIGHT ARM
				278-500-645-321

						ZORG
				I'll call you back.

134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

135	INT.  SHUTTLE

	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

						COPILOT
				Anti static pressure?

						MECHANIC
				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly.

137	EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

138	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	A keyboard slowly appears in front of Zorg.

						ZORG
					(typing the number)
				278... 500...

139	SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

	The pilot gradually turns the engines up.

						COPILOT
				10 seconds...

						PILOT
				Power increase.

	- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that's about to
lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

						ZORG
				3... 2... 1...

	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

						PILOT
				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

	- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and
everything else   within 60 feet.

140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

141	INT.  COCKPIT

	In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

						COPILOT
					(relaxing)
				Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up.

142	INT.  CABIN

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben's.

143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT

	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


144	EXT.  SPACE

	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

145	INT.  SPACESHIP

	In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

						TECHNICIAN
				All right! We're finally getting something!

146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

						PRESIDENT
				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE

	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						ZORG
				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						SHADOW
				Am I disturbing you?

						ZORG
				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW'S breathing is awesome.

						SHADOW
				...Not far, now.

						ZORG
				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

						SHADOW
				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

						ZORG
				Got it.

						SHADOW
				How's our deal coming along?

						ZORG
					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						SHADOW
				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						ZORG
				The Stones will be here. I'll see to it
				personally!

						SHADOW
				...I can't wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE

	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

						STEWARDESS
				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

						STEWARDESS
					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

151	INT.  COCKPIT

	A blinking light goes on.

						PILOT
				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben's box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She's not there.

153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area.

						PILOT
				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

157	INT.  CABIN

	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle.

						KORBEN
					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I'm trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL

	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

						HOSTESS
					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

						HOST
					(playful)
				If you don't have the code you can't
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

						LOC RHOD
					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don't leave me here
				alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

						KORBEN
				I'll take you to the bar, after that,
				you're on your own.

						LOC RHOD
					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

						KORBEN
				I don't think this is a good time...

						LOC RHOD
				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

						KORBEN
					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

						LOC RHOD
				I didn't have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn't
				hear me...

159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

						KORBEN
				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn't bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

						HOSTESS
					(looking him over)
				Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				You little sleaze bag!

						KORBEN
				...Ma???

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				Don't you ever ask me for another thing
				in my life again, you've killed your

						FOG
				Yes. Sir!

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(to Cornelius)
				OK, let's hear it.

						CORNELIUS
				Where was I?

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(bored)
				...You open the door. There's a cabby with
				a girl in his arms.

	FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.
They hold up a THIRD COP.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

						BEAT-UP COP
				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...
				with green eyes.

	Cornelius perks up.

						CORNELIUS
				And the smile of an angel?

	They all turn to look at him.

						CORNELIUS
					(to Chief)
				May I speak to you alone.

167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				One last time...

	The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
					(nodding)
				Miss.

	Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

168	EXT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

						FOG
				Hello, I'm head of security.
				Everything is in order. You can...

	The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

						FOG
				...make yourselves at home safely.
				If you need anything...give it a knock!

169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks
both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet.

170	INT.  KORBEN'S  STATEROOM

	Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						KORBEN
				Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days
				vacation and I'll be damned if I'm
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	The door RINGS.

						KORBEN
				...Hang on, it's the door. No!
				I told you I didn't bring anybody!
				I'm all alone... as usual!

	Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(to his mother)
				...I'll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

						KORBEN
				Here we go again...

						LEELOO
					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						KORBEN
				You get that off the screen?

						LEELOO
				Yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

						KORBEN
				You noticed..

						LEELOO
				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

						KORBEN
				Where you going?

						LEELOO
				I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's
				the matter?... Do I look bad?

						KORBEN
				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

						LEELOO
				Do you know how this works?

	Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						KORBEN
				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

						KORBEN
				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

						LEELOO
				And you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

						KORBEN
				It's difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

						KORBEN
				Army issue. I'm sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

						LEELOO
					(seething)
				You're nothing but a... a...

						KORBEN
				The words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. I won't
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben my man what's happening here?
				Who's the chick? What's the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

						KORBEN
				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the

				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

	ANGLE ON:

	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

						BABY RAY
				...to who?

						LOC RHOD
					(moving down the aisle)
				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king

				...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet
				whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.
				"I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she
				recently confessed to me. She will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

						AKANIT
				It's showtime!

178	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

179	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindbergh and his staff, including Munro, sit at the desk.
Speakers appear.

180	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

						MANAGER
					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Flowers for the Diva.

						MANAGER
				She's allergic to flowers!!!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				There's champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

						CORNELIUS
				...My God!

184	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

						CAPTAIN
				Commander, I have a ship with a main
				malfunction. He requests permission to
				dock for repairs.

						COMMANDER
				Did you check out his registration number?

						CAPTAIN
				Everything's in order.

						COMMANDER
				Put him in the docking garage and inform
				the police.

185	INT.  COCKPIT  ZFX200 - NIGHT

						CAPTAIN (V.O.)
				Permission granted. Dock 575.  You have
				an hour. Will that be enough time'?

	Zorg sits at the controls.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				More than enough.

186	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The ZFX approaches Fhloston.

187	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window.

	FLASHBACK:

	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

188	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

						CORNELIUS
					(in a panic)
				Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I'm going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

						MANGALORE
				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

						LEELOO
				(smiling)
			Apipoulai!

191	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo.

	INTERCUT':

192	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL.

	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

193	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

194	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

195	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL

	Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

196	INT.  ROOM

	Akanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

						MANGALORE
				They were waiting for us! It was an
				ambush!

						AKANIT
				If it's war they want it's war they'll get!
				Enact the Final Plan!

	All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

197	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there
holding a ZF1.

						ZORG
				My compliments, little lady!
				...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
				I couldn't have done it any better myself!
					(sharply)
				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

						ZORG
				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

198	INT.	AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

199	INT.  SUITE

	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

						ZORG
					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can't hide...

200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief's head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

						AKANIT
				Nobody move! We're taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

						CORNELIUS
					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

201	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

						MANGALORE 1
				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

203	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

204	INT.  CONCERT HALL

	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON

	Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

						ZORG
				You want something done, do it yourself!

206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

						LOC RHOD
					(voice low, panicked)
				They're hideous. They've got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

207	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

						PRESIDENT
				Send a battalion out immediately!

208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

						DIVA
				Don't worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

						KORBEN
				I've never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

						DIVA
					(weak)
				You're a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

						KORBEN
				Who?

						DIVA
				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo... is... she's...

						DIVA
				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she's the only one
				who knows how to use them.

						KORBEN
					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

209	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

						DIVA
				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						KORBEN
				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

						DIVA
				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						KORBEN
					(uncomfortable)
				I'll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

						DIVA
				Do you love her?

						KORBEN
				I... I don't know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						DIVA
				I don't have time... I need to know.

						KORBEN
				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

						DIVA
				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva's eyes close.

211	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

						KORBEN
				Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!
				You're not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

213	INT.  SPACESHIP

	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It's empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

						DIVA
					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

						MANGALORE 2
				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						KORBEN
				...In me?

	He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						LOC RHOD
				Don't you think we'd better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						MANGALORE
				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						KORBEN
				That's it... I've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						KORBEN
				You don't do what I say... I'll waste
				you myself. Got it?

						LOC RHOD
				Got it...

215	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

216	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

						AKANIT
				What's the situation in the hall?

217	INT.  HALL

	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

						MUGGER
					(into walkie-talkie)
				There's no more resistance.
				Everything's under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

						KORBEN
				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

						LOC RHOD
				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

						LOC RHOD
				It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

						PRINCESS AACHEN
					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

						LOC RHOD
				GET OFF MY BACK!

	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

						KORBEN
				Toss me the balls!

						BABY RAY
					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

						KORBEN
				The balls for Christ's sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

						EMPEROR JAPHET
				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

						KORBEN
				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

						EMPEROR
				I'd say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb's up.

						LOC RHOD
				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an
				amazing 90 foot pitch.

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

						FOG
				Thanks for your help.

						KORBEN
				Forget it.

	Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him.

218	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Korben bursts into the room. He stares at the luminous bar still struck
to the ground and sees the hole Leeloo escaped through.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo???

219	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE - CEILING

	Leeloo in bleeding all over.  She can barely move.

						LEELOO

222	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY - FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The last of the Mangalores have barricaded themselves in the back of the
station and shoot at anything that tries to enter.  Korben joins the
policemen already there.

						COP 1
				Hey, who are you?

						KORBEN
				The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.

	Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives.

						KORBEN
				Seven to the left. Five to the right.

						COP
				What's he doing?

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

						KORBEN
				Six to the left. One to the right.

						LOC RHOD
				He's on vacation.

						KORBEN
					(reloading)
				We got to find the leader. Mangalores
				don't fight without a leader.

223	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit gets up, grabs Cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head.

						AKANIT
				One more shot and we start killing
				hostages, got that?

224	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY

						KORBEN
				Found him...

						AKANIT
					(tense)
				Send someone to negotiate!

						KORBEN
				Mind if I go? I'm an excellent
				negotiator.

						COP 1
				Uh... Sure, go ahead.

	Korben gets ready.

						COP 1
				We're sending someone in who's
				authorized to negotiate.

225	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his
gun and puts a bullet through his head.

						KORBEN
				Anyone else want to negotiate?

						COP 2
					(to another Cop)
				Where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

226	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				From us!

	The President gives Munro a hard look.

227	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

						CORNELIUS
				You're probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

						KORBEN
				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo's in trouble?

						KORBEN
				When is she not in trouble?

						CORNELIUS
				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

228	INT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE  LANDING  DOCK  AND  GARAGE

	The ZFX200 settles in the landing dock garage.  SECURITY POLICE approach
the ship just as Zorg in getting out holding the ZF1.

						POLICEMAN
				More trouble?

						ZORG
				Nothing I can't fix myself.

	He brings up the ZF1 and wipes out the garage.

229	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Korben enters the Diva's suite which is in shambles.  He looks
everywhere, but finds nothing.

230	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo lies in a pool of blood.  She hears something below her.

231	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Exhausted, Loc Rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face
with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(loudly)
				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

						LEELOO
				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

						KORBEN
				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what're these numbers clicking
				by?

						CORNELIUS
				Probably the time remaining before it
				explodes.

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

						LOC RHOD
					(weak smile)
				You're just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.
				There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is a Type A alert. For security reasons

				Maybe we oughta be going,

						KORBEN
				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

						KORBEN
				It's the latest model.. I've never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

235	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben's hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						KORBEN
				Don't worry, I'm here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						KORBEN
				Just relax. I've got the Stones.
				Everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(falling to pieces)
				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of
				your time here?

						KORBEN
					(to Leeloo)
				I'll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						ZORG
				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

						ZORG
				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special
				Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

	Korben doesn't reply.

						ZORG
				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

						ZORG
				...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

						KORBEN
				Don't you know how to count.
				It's not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

						KORBEN
				One! That's for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

						KORBEN
				Two! That's for firing me! Three!
				That's for pushing around a priest!
				And the rest is for what you did to
				my wife!

	Korben pummels him mercilessly.

236	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

237	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3
minutes.

						KORBEN

244	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Zorg is busy with the ZF1 when the bomb starts to BEEP signaling the last
ten seconds.  Zorg is terror stricken.  He pushes a button and holds the
ZF1 over his head.

				Maximum Protection.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod are bent over the buttons looking for a way to
release the lines.

				6... 5...

						KORBEN
				Found it?

	Loc Rhod searches frantically.

						LOC RHOD
				I don't even know what I'm looking for!

						KORBEN
				Fuck it! Hold tight!

	Korben slams the throttle into full forward.  The ship roars away ripping
the lines to shreds.

	Loc Rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship.

	CUT TO:

	The counter goes 1... 0

	-The suite disintegrates - The corridor is consumed.

	-The main hall is no more.

246	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The ZFX200 jets away as the enormous oceanliner explodes behind it.

247	INT.  ZFX200

	The ship stops shaking.  That was a close one.  Everyone's relieved.

						KORBEN
				Solid little jobs, aren't they?

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, exhausted)
				Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and
				kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the
				news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				Beep. End of transmission.

	Loc Rhod lets out a huge sigh.

						LOC RHOD
					(to the others)
				The best show I ever did!

248	EXT.  PLANET  FHLOSTON

	A magnetic sarcophagus crosses the Fhloston sky and crashes into a
glacier.

249	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	Zorg appears in the middle of the ice.  He takes a portable phone out of
the ZF1.

						ZORG
				How's that? Can you hear me better
				now?

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly!
				So, how was the concert?

						ZORG
				Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to
				listen to music! Listen up instead of
				running off at the mouth!
				The batteries on my phone are almost gone.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Yes, Sir!

						ZORG
				Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately.
				Someone stole mine.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to
				the hotel.

						ZORG
				I'm not at the hotel!

						ZORG
				Hello?...

						BEEPER (O.S.)
				Battery dead.

	Zorg is all alone, lost, in the middle of the glacier.

						ZORG
					(to himself)
				Stay calm.... stay calm...

250	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	General Munro enters the office with a smile.

						MUNRO
				Major Dallas has the Five Elements on
				board. The priest is guiding them directly
				to the temple.

	President Lindberg closes his eyes in relief.

						PRESIDENT
				Thank God! We've been saved!

	A SCIENTIST rushes in.

						SCIENTIST
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				Yes? Now, what?

251	EXT.  SPACE

	A ball of fire, all-powerful Evil, speeds across the screen with three
Federal Army warships following along behind it as best they can.

252	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT
				What do you mean, "its advancing"?!

253	INT.  COCKPIT  FEDERATED  WARSHIP

						COMMANDER
				It's not only advancing, but it's moving at
				incredible speed! We're having trouble
				following it.

254	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT
					(to Scientist)
				...And... Do you have any idea where it's
				heading?

	The scientist is hard to put to answer, he shakes his head.

255	INT.  ZFX200  COCKPIT - NIGHT

	Korben gently wipes Leeloo's forehead with a cloth.  She opens her eyes a
little.

						KORBEN
					(gentle, loving)
				Apipoulai..

	Leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish.

						LEELOO
				I'm so very sad.

						KORBEN
				Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't
				you say?

						LEELOO
				Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs...
				Money...
				Everything you create is used to destroy...

						KORBEN
				I told you not to read all that crap!

						LEELOO
				Protect life... Until death.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

						CORNELIUS
				There's a General on the phone...
				His name's Mambo, I think.

256	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				Munro here. President Lindberg wants
				to talk to you.  Hold the line.

	The President clears his throat and takes the phone.

						PRESIDENT
				Major, first off, I want to thank you,
				in my name and in the name of the
				Federation...

257	INT.  ZFX200 / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				For the praiseworthy courage you have
				shown us! I'd like to congratulate General
				Munro for his choice. He found the ideal
				man for such a...

						KORBEN
					(to the point)
				So now what's the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

						PRESIDENT
				There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
				heading straight for the earth. And we have
				no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

						KORBEN
				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

						SCIENTIST
				If its speed remains constant... in an
				hour and 57 minutes.

						KORBEN (O.S.)
				I'll call you back in two hours.

	Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned.

258	EXT.  SPACE

	The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded
cosmos.

259	INT.  CHAPEL

	David is asleep.  He is woken by the sound of...

260	EXT.  DESERT - DAWN

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

						DAVID
				You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

						CORNELIUS
				Later, David! Later!
				There's not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

261	INT.  CHAPEL

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray
				later?

	Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off
lowering the altar like a service elevator.

	The altar descends amid rocky walls.

262	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				They just landed in the desert.

						PRESIDENT
					(sweating)
				How much time is left?

263	EXT.  SPACE

	Earth is in view.  The Dark Planet fills the screen and heads for the
blue planet.

264	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

265	INT.  TEMPLE

	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

						CORNELIUS
					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

						KORBEN
				Don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

						CORNELIUS
				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don't have the reference book.
				I've never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

						KORBEN
				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

						LOC RHOD
				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

						KORBEN
				No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				There's no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

						KORBEN
				And you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						CORNELIUS
				That's what I'm saying.

266	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly.

267	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben leans over Leeloo.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open
				them! How does it work?

						LEELOO
					(feeble)
				The wind blows... the fire burns...

						KORBEN
				I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking
				about the Stones.

						LEELOO
				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

						KORBEN
				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

						KORBEN
				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(afraid)
				I'm looking, I'm looking.

268	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The tension is palpable in the President's office.

						SCIENTIST
				...Three minutes.

						MUNRO
				We've lost contact with them.

269	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

						LOC RHOD
				...we'll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

						LOC RHOD
				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

						KORBEN
				What did you say? What did you do?

						LOC RHOD
				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
				nothing!

						KORBEN
				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						LOC RHOD
				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

	Nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				Is that all?

						LOC RHOD
				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.

						KORBEN
				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

						KORBEN
				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

						LOC RHOD
					(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

						KORBEN
				Don't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

270	EXT.  SPACE

	A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles
away.

271	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					Two more minutes.

	The President shuts his eyes.  His lids move in prayer.

272	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors
crisscross.

						KORBEN
				It's up to you now, Angel!

						LEELOO
				I'm so tired...

						KORBEN
				You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

						LEELOO
				I want to sleep... forever...

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on
				a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,
				this time, for as long as you want.
				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						CORNELIUS
				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

273	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.  A hundred miles before impact.
The African continent is visible.  No doubt about it:	The fireball is
heading right for Egypt.

274	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist's stopwatch.

						SCIENTIST
				It'll be entering the atmosphere in one
				minute.

275	INT.  CHAPEL

	The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's.  A drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! If you don't get on with the
				program we're all gonna die! And that's
				not on my agenda for today.

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

						LEELOO
					(weak)
				What's the use of saving lives...
				when you see what you do with them!

						KORBEN
				You're right but there are lots of good
				things... beautiful things...

						LEELOO
				...Like love...

						KORBEN
				Exactly.

						LEELOO
				But I don't know love... I'm like a machine
				programmed to save other people's lives but
				never to have one of my own.

276	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Scientist's stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds.

277	INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				I have thousands of memories but none
				of them are mine... There is no need for
				me other than this. I'm immortal but I have
				no life.

						KORBEN
				Yes, you do! I need you. More than you
				can imagine! Stand up straight!

						LEELOO
				Why?... Why would you need me?

						KORBEN
				Because...

						CORNELIUS
					(to himself)
				Tell her, for God's sake!

	A bit of the black acid falls on Loc Rhod's shirt setting it on fire.  He
rips if off.

	CUT TO:

278	INT.  CHAPEL

						KORBEN
				Because...

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is
everywhere.

						LEELOO
				Tell me...

						KORBEN
				I love you...

	Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

	CUT TO:

278b	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

279 INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				Now you're allowed to kiss me.

	- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

280	EXT.  SPACE

	The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
	Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

281	INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

	President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead-

						SCIENTIST
				The planet seems to have stopped at...
				62 miles from impact.

282	INT.  CHAPEL

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

	Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

						LOC RHOD
				This guy is a killer with the babes.
				I knew it from the moment I laid eyes
				on him.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on
kissing.

283	INT.  LABORATORY

	We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  The President enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						MUNRO
				Mr. President, let me introduce you to
				Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						MACTILBURGH
				It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
					(beaming)
				Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

						MACTILBURGH
				They were so tired from their ordeal that
				we put them in the reactor this morning..

						PRESIDENT
				I have 19 more meetings after this one
				Professor..

						PROFESSOR
				Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.

						AIDE
				We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.

						MACTILBURGH
				I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				Mr. President.

	The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						AIDE
				No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...

						PRESIDENT
				Who is it?

						AIDE
				Some woman... claims she's Korben's

						PRESIDENT
				Give it here...

	The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

						PRESIDENT
				Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.
				On behalf of the entire Federation,
				I would like to thank...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Don't pull that crap with me, Finger...
				I'd recognize that trash can voice of

				You tell that worthless no account son

	Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.

	PAN slowly across Manhattan.
	Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.

                                    2ND REVISED DRAFT

                                     February 8, 1993

                

               TITLES UNFOLD IN BLACKNESS as we are lulled by the distant 
               flute-like sounds of a recorder. Overall the effect is 
               mournful and haunting, elegant and serene...

               ...and we CRASH TO:

               EXT - BARENTS SEA - NIGHT

               ...a storm of inconceivable force and violence. Merciless 
               arctic winds whip the sea in a frenzy of thirty-foot swells.

               This is the last place in God's creation that any human being 
               should be. And yet...

               ...the prow of a three-masted ship rises massively before 
               us, looming from the darkness and chaos. it crashes upward 
               through a swell and slams back down again, plunging nose- 
               first into the trough. The sails on the forward mast are 
               still deployed. It's insane; in this weather they should be 
               stowed (as is already the case with masts 2 and 3).

               Hurtling toward us. Rising and falling. Thundering through 
               the swells. And as she sweeps past CAMERA within a seeming 
               hairbreadth, we PAN with the ship and find ourselves...

               EXT - SHIP - NIGHT

               ...aboard the "Alexander Nevsky," along for the ride whether 
               we like it or not. There are men all around us, dark screaming 
               FIGURES glimpsed and half-glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes 
               flapping in the gale. A GROUP OF MEN are in a life-or-death 
               tug of war

                                     WALTON
                         PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL!

               Riiiiippp! All eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears 
               loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing 
               tatters. The jib-arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, 
               trailing rope and fabric. The men dive aside as the jib 
               smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb. Splintered 
               shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel.

               Walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face- 
               down on the pitching deck.

               GRIGORI, the first mate, scrambles to Walton's aid. Walton 
               shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees. LIGHTNING 
               throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: 
               blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, 
               staining his teeth. He gazes up at the mainsail, still intact 
               and straining against the wind. We hear a huge CRACK!

               The base of the mast is starting to give.

                                     WALTON
                         Cut the damn rigging free before we 
                         lose the mast!

               Long-handled axes are grabbed from their mounts. Frantic men 
               begin hacking at the ropes. Walton snatches an axe from a 
               passing crewman and elbows his way to the front. He attacks 
               a guy-rope with primal fury, CAMERA rising and falling with 
               the motion of his axe. Suddenly, a chilling cry from high 
               above:

                                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
                         IIIICEBEEEEERG!

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The LOOKOUT is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope 
               knotted at the chest. He points ahead.

               WALTON and the others spin to look as A PANORAMIC SHOT OF 
               THE BARENTS SEA reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. 
               The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting 
               the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying 
               these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine 
               field.

               An iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the 
               foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us 
               into darkness...

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               ...and we wipe from darkness as a flapping piece of canvas 
               billows away to reveal 'Walton and the crew, gazing in 
               breathless horror as an iceberg looms from the gale before 
               them like a ghostly white mountain. Walton finds his voice:

                         HARD TO PORT!

               THE PILOT fights to turn the wheel. Men rush to his aid, 
               throw their backs into it, straining to the limit. The wheel 
               is grudging, fighting them every inch of the way.

               PUSH IN on Walton and the crew:

                         It's going to ram us.

                                     WALTON
                         It wouldn't dare.

               THE CROW'S NEST (MAST #2)

               The lookout fumbles under his coat, grabs the rosary around 
               his neck, clutches the crucifix tightly in both hands. Face 
               white with terror. Breath coming in ragged gasps.

               SHIP'S POV

               world and the audience on its ear. iceberg looming.  For a 
               brief moment we seem to be veering past. But then we swing 
               back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge...

               ...and smack the ice.

               VARIOUS QUICK-CUT ANGLES

               God just hit the ship with an anvil. Mast #1 snaps at the 
               base with a thunderous CRACK and begins to topple in a 
               symphony of shattering wood and tangled rigging...

               The lookout on mast #2 is vaulted through the railing of the 
               crow's nest, screaming through the air, arms and legs 
               windmilling as he plummets head-first toward the deck below... 

               And is jerked to an abrupt stop by the safety line around

               his back breaking...

               Men are sliding, tumbling, screaming. Mast #1 completes its 
               fall, slamming massively to the deck, shattering a section 
               of the gunwale to splinters. Utter panic. Total chaos...

               Sheer mortal terror. And as the sequence builds to a final

               ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               Total, stunning silence.

               A glittering wasteland of ice. Breathlessly cold. Even the 
               sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon. Pellets of 
               snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a 
               desolate arctic wind. It's as if Hell had erupted through 
               the floor of the Earth in the form of ice. Nothing could 
               survive here. Nothing. 

               SLOW PAN reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at 
               a permanent list. Silent. We see no signs of life.

               A flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind...

               The pilot's wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice. The 
               forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb, 
               extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging...

               The ship's prow is smashed open above the water line...

               A familiar rosary lies broken on the deck. Beads scattered. 
               |A tiny Christ figure lies with arms thrown wide, painted 
               eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice...

               HIGH, HIGH ANGLE

               From the top of mast #2. A breathtaking perspective of the 
               entire ship below, guaranteed to induce vertigo. The corpse 
               of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen 
               rope, His posture mimics the Christ figure: His arms thrown 
               wide, dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet 
               of ice. A ghastly still-life, the corpse twisting ever-so-
               slightly on the wind, rope creaking...

               A SAILOR thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the 
               rigging, WIDEN to reveal TWO MORE MEN as they reach out with 
               long gaffing poles to snag the corpse.

               EXT - NEVSKY - LOW ANGLE FROM ICE - TWILIGHT

               Walton watches them reel the body in. ANGLE SHIFTS as he 
               turns, revealing the rest of the crew working desperately to 
               free the ship. Axes and picks rise and fall in waves, slamming 
               into the ice, throwing up frozen chips. The men are near 
               collapse, exhaustion carved in their faces. The dogs are 
               nearby, huskies and malamutes huddled in the snow. Walton 
               rejoins the men, rams his axe fiercely into the ice.

                                     WALTON
                         Put your backs into it!

                                     SAILOR #1
                         What's the use? This godless ice 
                         stretches for miles! Would you have 
                         us chow our way back to England?

                                     WALTON
                         No. But we'll chop our way to the 
                         North Pole if we have to. Inch by 
                         bloody inch.

                                     GRIGORI
                         You can't mean to go on! Our journey 
                         is ended! The best we can hope for 
                         now is to get out of this alive!

                                     SAILOR #2
                         Aye, if the ice ever lets us!

                                     WALTON
                         The ice will break. And when it does, 
                         we proceed north... as planned.

               Cries of dismay from the men. Grigori thrusts his arm toward 
               the sky, pointing at the corpse on the mast.

                                     GRIGORI
                         At the cost of how many more lives?

               He's interrupted by a long, chilling HOWL. The lead husky 
               rises to its feet, hackles up, HOWLING at some unseen thing 
               in the distance. The other dogs start rising around him, 
               joining in, staring off across the ice.

                                     GRIGORI
                         There's something out there.

               The dogs are going berserk. The lead husky breaks free and 
               launches himself across the ice. The men scramble to restrain 
               the animals, but three more break away and take off after 
               their leader. Walton snatches up his rifle.

                                     WALTON
                         You five come with me! The rest stay 
                         with the ship!

               EXT - ARCTIC PANORAMA - TWILIGHT

               The Nevsky in the distance. The dogs come howling across the 
               ice toward us. The men trail substantially behind.

               BOOM DOWN to the icy boulders f.g. A massive hand comes 
               briefly to rest in one of the crags, ghastly gray skin 
               rippling with harsh ligaments and sinewy veins, brutal 
               surgical scars marring the wrist. A HUGE DARK FIGURE wipes 
               frame, fleeing into the rocks. The dogs come bounding past 
               in pursuit, snarling and slavering.

               THE RUNNING MEN hear an INHUMAN HOWL rise amidst those of 
               the dogs. A vicious free-for-all echoes from the rocks.

               Barking gives way to shrill squeals. An object is launched 
               from the crags, catapulted through the air in a high arc.

               Some men slip and fall as the object slams to the ground 
               with tremendous impact before them...

               ...and they find themselves staring in horror At the sight 
               of the lead dog. Silence now. Those who have fallen, rise.

               Walton cocks his rifle. The group proceeds, picks and axes 
               held ready, slowly skirting the rocks...

               ...and the massacre is revealed. Blood-stained ice. Dead, 
               mangled animals strewn about. One twitching survivor crawls 
               toward them on broken limbs, whining piteously, dragging its 
               entrails in a red smear.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Look.

               They follow his gaze. Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, 
               ascending the rocks. Most are smeared and vague... but one 
               is clearly a bare human footprint. Several men cross 
               themselves. Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the 
               surviving dog. BLAM! A single bullet to the brain ends its 
               misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice. The shot echoes 
               for miles.

                                     WALTON
                         Back to the ship.

               Silhouetted against the aurora borealis. The horizon swirls 
               mysteriously with color and light. Distant slivers of 
               lightning kiss the earth. Men keep watch in furtive groups, 
               huddled against the cold, breath punching the air with billows 
               of vapor. A massive CRACKLING is heard. A YOUNG SAILOR spins, 
               jumpy.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         Only the ice to starboard, boy.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         Is it breaking up?

                         Just dancing on the current. It'll 
                         freeze even tighter come next wind.

               CAMERA DRIFTS past to another group:

                                     SAILOR #4
                         It was a polar bear. That's what I 
                         say.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         Say all you want, but you weren't 
                         there. It left human tracks.

                                     SAILOR #6
                         No man could tear those dogs apart.

                                     SAILOR #5
                         No human. We've roused a demon from 
                         the ice.

               CLANG-CLANG! The men spin. A SAILOR on starboard has rung 
               the signal bell. The men race over, crowding the gunwale.

                                     SAILOR
                         Something. In the mist.

               Walton appears from his cabin and crowds his way to the front, 
               rifle aimed at the sky. The men wait. Holding their breath. 
               Scanning the darkness.

               AN APPARITION looms eerily from the mist on a creaking floe 
               of ice, silhouetted by the shifting light of the borealis. 
               The figure's pose is uncanny and weird: neither standing nor 
               kneeling, but something in between, arm dangling at its side 
               and lolling slowly with the motion of the current.

                                     YOUNG SAILOR
                         It's the demon! Shoot while you've a 
                         chance!

               The Pilot lights the kerosene wick of a reflector box 
               spotlight and swings it around. The beam seeks out the specter 
               and pins it in a dim circle of light... revealing a man 
               collapsed on a dog sled, lashed to tiller upright stanchions 
               with frozen leather straps, Dead dogs lie in icy heaps around 
               him.

               EXT - NEVSKY - NIGHT

               The men venture onto the shifting ice with lanterns raised.

               Grappling lines are unslung and thrown, the ice floe snagged. 
               Gaffs reach out, drawing it closer. Men clasp arms, forming 
               a human chain. Grigori is the first to reach the motionless 
               figure on the dog sled.

                                     WALTON
                         Dead?

               Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the 
               furred hood to search the neck for a pulse...

               ...and the figure scares the shit out of him. With a 
               convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood 
               rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, 
               beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware. 
               Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with 
               VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.

               ...where we find Walton and Grigori in tense discussion:

                                     GRIGORI
                         Captain, I implore you. The men are 
                         frightened and angry. They want your 
                         assurance.

                                     WALTON
                         They knew the risks when they signed 
                         on. I've come too far to turn back 
                         now.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Then you run the danger of pushing 
                         them to mutiny.

               Walton pulls a pistol from his drawer and slams it flat on 
               the table before him.

                                     WALTON
                              (low, tight)
                         Let them try.

               Grigori is taken aback. He hears a shifting of blankets and 
               glances to the captain's bed. Walton follows his look.

               Frankenstein has awakened and is watching them.

               Grigori exits, uneasy under Frankenstein's gaze. Walton rises, 
               retrieves a pot from the stove.

                                     WALTON
                         You're awake. I've prepared some 
                         broth. It'll help restore you.

                         I'm... dying.

               Victor draws a hand from under the blanket and holds it before 
               his face. Fingers skeletal and black.

                         There's a startling question, coming 
                         from you.
                              (beat)
                         I'm captain of this ship. We sailed 
                         from Archangel a month ago, seeking 
                         a passage to the North Pole.

                                     VICTOR
                         Ah. An explorer.

                                     WALTON
                         Would-be. I'm plagued with my share 
                         of difficulties just at the moment.

                                     VICTOR
                         I heard.

                                     WALTON
                         I can't say I blame them. We're 
                         trapped in this ice and bedeviled by 
                         some sort of... creature.

                                     VICTOR
                         Creature? A... human like creature?

                                     WALTON
                              (stunned)
                         You know of it?

                                     VICTOR
                         Your men are right to be afraid.

                                     WALTON
                         Then explain it, whatever it is. It 
                         could save the voyage. I've spent 
                         years planning this. My entire 
                         fortune.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'd persist at the cost of your 
                         own life? The lives of your crew?

                                     WALTON
                         Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge 
                         we gain, the achievements we leave 
                         behind... those live on.

               Victor reaches out with his blackened claw of a hand, pulls 
               him closer. Impassioned, intense:

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you share my madness?

                                     WALTON
                         Madness?

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY on Victor's face...

                                     VICTOR
                         We are kindred, you and I. Men of 
                         ambition. Let me tell you all that I 
                         have lost in such pursuits. I pray 
                         my story will come to mean for you 
                         all that is capricious and evil in 
                         man.

                                     WALTON
                              (angry, frightened)
                         Who are you?

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat)
                         My name is Frankenstein...

               And CAMERA proceeds into the bottomless depths of Victor's 
               staring eye, plunging us into:

               TOTAL DARKNESS. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. A METRONOME fades up 
               before us.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Failure has no pride, Victor. You 
                         must try again.

                                     LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
                         Yes, Ma'am.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - DAY

               We hear a HARPSICHORD begin playing as a WIDER ANGLE reveals 
               a huge, magnificent room with vaulted ceilings thirty feet 
               high. Floor-to-ceiling windows. Hanging tapestries.

               VICTOR sits at the harpsichord, a very serious 7 year-old in 
               his little gentleman's suit and stiff starched collar.

               MRS. MORITZ, head of the housekeeping staff, conducts the 
               lesson. Her daughter JUSTINE, age 4, sits with her doll in a 
               huge wingback chair, making it dance to the music as she 
               listens... but her eyes are on Victor. She adores him.

               An enormous door swings open. Victor stops playing. His 
               PARENTS enter, ushering a somber and beautiful ELIZABETH, 
               age 6, across the vast expanse of floor. Victor slides off 
               the bench and faces them.

                                     FATHER
                         Mrs. Moritz, would you and your 
                         daughter excuse us?

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along, 
                         Justine. Bring your dolly.

               Mrs. Moritz takes Justine's hand. Justine gazes back at Victor 
               and Elizabeth as her mother whisks her off.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's 
                         coming to live with us.

                                     FATHER
                         She has lost her parents to scarlet 
                         fever. She is an orphan.

                                     MOTHER
                         You must think of her as your own 
                         sister. You must look after her. And 
                         be kind to her.

               Victor stares at Elizabeth. She returns the gaze evenly, 
               self-possessed and dignified even at this young age.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I loved her from the moment that I 
                         first saw her.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - NIGHT

               A MASSIVE BOLT OF LIGHTNING hammers from the sky, reducing a 
               centuries-old oak tree to smoldering ruin...

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               ...while Victor gazes at the storm, face pressed against a 
               window, astonished at the sight.

               Lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face.

                                     MOTHER
                         Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by 
                         the storm. Go comfort her.

               INT - UPPER LANDING - NIGHT

               We hear a CHILD SOBBING. Victor comes racing up the grand 
               staircase from below as LIGHTNING sends wild banister shadows 
               skittering. He caroms down the hall toward:

               INT - ELIZABETH'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Victor enters. Elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult-
               size bed, gazing up with tear-streaked face at the huge 
               skylights in the vaulted ceiling, dreading the next scary 
               boom and flash. Victor approaches and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't cry, Elizabeth.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (frightened)
                         Aren't you?

               KA-BOOM! A LIGHTNING BOLT rips overhead, rattling the panes 
               of glass. Victor does find it scary... but exhilarating.

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll build a fort. So the lightning 
                         can't get us.

               He races about the room, grabbing every pillow he can find 
               and hurling them to her. Big decorative pillows from the 
               chaise, bed pillows from the armoire... they all come flying. 
               She giggles as a big one knocks her flat. Victor scampers 
               onto the bed with her. They pile the pillows around and above, 
               concealing themselves in a bulging heap of cushions.

               INSIDE THE PILLOW-FORT

               Victor pokes his hand up, widening a space so they can still 
               see. Lightning glistens in their upturned eyes.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Are you sure it can't hurt us?

                                     VICTOR
                         Nothing can. Not ever.

               She seeks his hand. Fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

               TILT UP to the skylight. Rain drumming the glass...

               INT - MANSION - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth are learning to waltz, their movements 
               stiff and awkward, childlike. MRS. MORITZ is at the 
               harpsichord. Justine sits with her dolly, watching.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         You must lead, Victor. The lady will 
                         always look to you for guidance, so 
                         your steps must be sure and strong...

                                     VICTOR
                         Mrs. Moritz.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         ...aaand, one-two-three, one-two- 
                         three, twirl-two-three...

                                     JUSTINE
                         Mama, can I dance with Victor?

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a 
                         sweeping arc about the room! one- 
                         two-three, twirl-two-three.

               Victor and Elizabeth gamely work their way across the vast 
               room, tripping on each other's toes. They pass within inches 
               of CAMERA, bodies WIPING FRAME...

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY (TEN YEARS LATER)

               ...and they sweep from before our eyes, waltzing away from 
               camera to reveal Victor now 17, intense and handsome as he 
               approaches manhood. Elizabeth is a blossoming and graceful 
               beauty at 16. Mrs. Moritz is still conducting the lessons.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three... 
                         Excellent! You'll be the envy of all 
                         the young ladies and gentlemen!

               They're certainly the envy of Justine, who gazes at Victor 
               as he sweeps Elizabeth around the room in his arms. She isn't 
               concentrating and fumbles on the keyboard. Her mother throws 
               her a look of reproval:

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine. Surely you can maintain 
                         better time than that.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes, Mama.

               Flustered, she puts her attention back on the keyboard as 
               Victor and Elizabeth keep dancing, swirling fluidly about 
               the room, their attention only on each other.

               INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

               A skylight above us. A storm is raging, rain drumming the 
               glass. We hear SCREAMING in the house. TILT DOWN to Victor 
               perched at the edge of a settee, seething with tension.

               Waiting. Elizabeth is with him. She squeezes his arm, trying 
               to reassure him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She'll be all right.

               Another SCREAM rips down the hallway. Justine comes scurrying 
               up the stairs, about to enter his parent's room with a fresh 
               load of sheets. Victor lunges to his feet and intercepts, 
               trying to push past her, but finds the doorway implacably 
               blocked by Mrs. Moritz.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         You can do nothing here. Wait 
                         downstairs.

               He can see his mother in the dim kerosene light, writhing 
               and screaming on the bed, belly swollen and distended. His 
               father, sleeves rolled up, works feverishly to save her.

                                     VICTOR
                         Mother?

                                     FATHER
                         Victor, do as you're told!

               Justine glances at Victor, longing to comfort him. She 
               squeezes past into the room. The door slams in his face. He 
               turns to Elizabeth, eyes brimming with terror...

               INT - PARENTS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...as his mother falls back on the sweat-soaked sheets, 
               blowing air like a bellows, trying to give birth...

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               ...while her SCREAMS mingle with the howling of the wind, 
               the stump of the long-dead oak tree pokes from the earth in 
               the foreground like a gravestone, lashed by the rain.

               INT - DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR - NIGHT

               VICTOR stares out the window at the raging storm. Elizabeth 
               appears at his side. He doesn't look at her.

                                     VICTOR
                         As a boy, I stood at this window and 
                         watched God destroy our tree.

               b.g. screaming stops, Victor and Elizabeth turn, gazing up 
               the grand staircase. The sudden silence is even more 
               frightening. The FAINT CRY of a newborn infant drifts down A 
               door opens upstairs, throwing a spill of light. Victor's 
               father appears in silhouette, comes down the stairs toward 
               them. He pauses halfway down, unable to continue.

                                     VICTOR
                         Father?

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's 
               father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes 
               spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh God. The blood.

               Father sits down shakily on a step. Victor and Elizabeth 
               race up the stairs and pause before him.

                                     FATHER
                         I did everything I could.

               Victor lets out a sob of anguish. Elizabeth begins to cry.

               Father gathers them into his arms.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAY

               A BABY CARRIAGE stands amidst leaning gravestones, gothic 
               and ornate, a chill breeze billowing the lace.

               A PRIEST recites a Latin burial mass. DOZENS OF MOURNERS are 
               gathered before the Frankenstein family mausoleum... an 
               imposing edifice of stone and spidery wrought-iron, its 
               steepled roof crowned by a massive granite crucifix.

               A sleek black casket lies atop the bier, ringed with flowers 
               and sorrow. The trees are windswept and bare, branches stark 
               against a steely gray sky. Victor and Elizabeth stand apart 
               from the others, staring at the casket. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         How could all my father's knowledge 
                         and skill fail to save her?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's not ours to decide. All that 
                         live must die. It's God's will.

               Victor raises a grim look at the huge crucifix atop the 
               mausoleum. Christ returns his gaze with blank stone eyes

                                     VICTOR
                         What kind of God is He to will this?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         She was mother to me as well. But 
                         ours is the job of the living. It's 
                         up to us now to hold this family 
                         together. We must think of Father 
                         and be strong for him.
                              (beat)
                         I cannot do that alone.

                                     VICTOR
                         God took her from us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He left a beautiful gift in her place. 
                         A baby boy. To cherish and love as 
                         our very own. Your brother

               Victor glances at the baby carriage. He seeks her hand. Their 
               fingers clasp. Comfort and strength.

                                     VICTOR
                         Our brother.

               The baby starts CRYING as the casket is lowered, its thin 
               voice carried on the wind...

               EXT - MEADOW - DAY

               A gorgeous, sun-dappled day. Tall grass waving on the breeze. 
               Butterflies skittering. WILLIAM, 11 months-old, toddles into 
               view. He doesn't get far. PLOP! Down he goes, right on his 
               ass. His face scrunches up in surprise and he bursts into 
               tears.

               Elizabeth hurries over and scoops him up, cradling and 
               comforting him. Victor rises from a picnic blanket to join 
               them. Nanny Justine looks up from her task of laying out the 
               silverware and food.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Poor William! What indignant tears!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         There, there... shhh...

               Victor takes the baby and swoops him high in the air. The 
               child shrieks and wails, held aloft.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, have a care! You'll make him 
                         dizzy!

                                     VICTOR
                         The world is a dizzying place.

               She tries to reclaim the baby. Victor feints, keeping Willie 
               out of reach. Elizabeth grows crosser:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh, do give him here! He needs to be 
                         comforted and held!

                                     VICTOR
                         He needs to vent his outrage to the 
                         skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! 
                         Learning to walk is not an easy thing! 
                         Why should it be so?

               Elizabeth is exasperated to realize that the baby has begun 
               to laugh. She glares at both of them. Men.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         That's the nature of all progress, 
                         William. Don't let your brother sway 
                         you otherwise.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Quite right!

               Victor cradles Willie as if to shield his delicate ears. He 
               peers at Elizabeth with mock-grave suspicion and speaks to 
               the baby sotto-voce, in deepest confidence, man-to-man:

                                     VICTOR
                         Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a 
                         feast to be consumed. Women would 
                         have you believe you must walk before 
                         you can run. Or run before you can 
                         waltz!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (laughing)
                         Give me that child before you fill 
                         his head with drivel!

               Victor waltzes the baby in circles. Elizabeth stalks them.

                                     VICTOR
                         Devil take walking, ladies! My brother 
                         shall learn to waltz!

               He grabs her by the waist, pulls her into it. There's no use 
               resisting. She succumbs and they dance with the baby between 
               them. Justine is gasping with laughter.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Scandalous! What would your dear 
                         mother say?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (thinks a beat)
                         One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl-
                         two-three...

               Laughing, Victor and Elizabeth waltz little William around 
               in a sweeping arc. They pass within inches of the CAMERA, 
               bodies wiping frame...

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT (6 YEARS LATER)

               To reveal the grand ballroom ablaze with candlelight and 
               spectacle as a HUNDRED DANCERS swirl about the floor in a 
               breathtaking waltz to the music of a full string ensemble 
               (NOTE: The music here should be our movie's distinctive 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME, which will reoccur later.)

               Victor and Elizabeth dance magnificently, room spinning about 
               them in a blur. Now 24, he's in the prime of manhood.

               Elizabeth, 23, is a drop-dead beauty radiating poise and 
               intelligence. They're so right for each other, so beautiful 
               together, your heart could break just looking at them.

               Justine, now 21, has blossomed into a beauty herself. She's 
               at the sidelines, wearing a lovely gown, wishing someone 
               would ask her to dance. William, now 7, scampers to her side. 
               She stoops to straighten his collar and smooth back his hair. 
               Waltzing couples swirl past them.

                                     WILLIE
                         Auntie Justine, Papa said I could 
                         have a sweet.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You can. But not before dinner.

               The music ends amidst applause. The men bow to the ladies, 
               the ladies curtsy in return. Victor escorts Elizabeth off 
               the dance floor. Elizabeth fans herself, flushed and happy.

                                     JUSTINE
                         You dance so beautifully together.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         And you look so lovely.

               They share a sisterly hug and a radiant smile. The orchestra 
               recommences. The music is lush. Justine looks hopefully to 
               Victor, keeping her tone light:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor? Spare me one dance?

               Elizabeth catches Victor's eye.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite 
                         out of breath.

               Victor gallantly offers his arm. Justine takes it, lighting 
               up as he escorts her onto the dance floor ...

               ...and they begin to dance. She's glowing. This is a big 
               moment for her. But they've hardly begun, when...

               ...ting-ting-ting, Victor's father is tapping a champagne 
               glass with a knife. The dancers stop. The orchestra falls 
               silent. Justine hides her disappointment as servants pass 
               among the guests with glasses of champagne.

                                     FATHER
                         My friends, fatherly pride won't 
                         allow this occasion to pass without 
                         my raising a toast.

               Shouts of assent. Victor is grabbed by his friends and dragged 
               forward, a glass of champagne shoved in his hands.

                                     FATHER
                         To Victor. My son. Who read every 
                         medical book in my library by age 
                         thirteen... and then re-read them, 
                         which seemed excessive even to me.
                              (the guests ROAR with 
                              laughter)
                         Drape yourself in glory, my boy.  
                         Study well.  When you return, you 
                         return a man of medicine. I will 
                         then be honored to call you 
                         "colleague."

                                     VICTOR
                         But never your equal.

                                     FATHER
                         No. You'll surpass me.

               Applause and roars of approval. The drinks are tossed back.

               Victor is jostled with backslaps and handshakes.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Music and warm light spill from the windows. A COUPLE eases 
               through a French door and come racing across the lawn, 
               giggling and hushing each other. They take refuge under a 
               tree, revealing their faces to the moonlight: Victor and 
               Elizabeth. She leans against the trunk to catch her breath.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Smell the air. Wonderful.

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a send-off, isn't it?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Father's so proud.

                                     VICTOR
                         And you?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Prouder still. You'll be the 
                         handsomest student there.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll have to do better than that.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You will.
                              (searches his eyes)
                         What do you want, Victor?

                                     VICTOR
                         To be the best there ever was. To 
                         push our knowledge beyond our 
                         dreams... to eradicate disease and 
                         pestilence... to purge mankind of 
                         ignorance and fear...

               He's so serious, she can't help laugh.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm not mad.

               She smiles, smoothes a lock of hair gently off his forehead.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No. Just very earnest. And very dear.

               An extended moment. Unspoken words flowing between them.

               Victor leans forward and kisses her. Her eyes widen slightly. 
               So do his. Shared excitement, gentle and sexy beyond belief. 
               They pause, draw back, searching each other's eyes. He 
               whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         I've loved you all my life

                                     ELIZABETH
                         All my life I've known.

               They kiss again. A breath. A shiver.

                                     VICTOR
                         This feels... incestuous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is that what makes it so delicious?

               She brushes her lips against his. Gentle as a sigh.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister still?

                                     VICTOR
                         I wish to be your husband.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I wish to be your wife.

                                     VICTOR
                         Then come with me to Ingolstadt. 
                         Marry me now.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If only I could. But one of us must 
                         stay. Father's not strong. Willie's 
                         just a child. Who can look after 
                         them in your absence? Who can run 
                         the estate?

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I will be here when you return.

               Another kiss. Turning lustful and steamy. They melt into 
               each other, sinking down, bodies pressing and minds afire.

               These people are hot for each other. They stop, stunned at 
               the intensity. He lays his head to her breast. Their fingers 
               clasp. She whispers her secret:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         My head is spinning. I want to give 
                         myself to you.

               He raises his head. She meets his gaze evenly

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If we're to be married, must we wait?

               He touches her face. Fingertips tracing downward, gentle and 
               reverent, brushing the contours of her bosom at the edge of 
               her bodice. She shivers. Closes her eyes. Lays her hand over 
               his. Guiding his touch.

                                     VICTOR
                         You make me weak.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Not as weak as I.

               She raises his hand to her mouth. Brushing his fingertips 
               with her lips. Wrestling with desire. Their eyes meet.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Our decision. Together.

                                     VICTOR
                         Your decision. For us.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (hesitates)
                         I give you my soul...

                                     VICTOR
                              (nods)
                         ...until our wedding night. When our 
                         bodies will join.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor. I love you,

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. My more than sister.

               They kiss again. Gently...

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - CEMETERY - DAWN

               A misty gray dawn. Victor is kneeling at a gravestone, 
               observing a moment of silence. His saddled horse is tethered 
               nearby. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll make you so proud, Mother.

               He lays a small sprig of flowers on the grave, rises and 
               walks toward his horse.

               EXT - MANSION - MORNING

               Overcast and chill. An open carriage stands loaded. The family 
               and household staff have turned out. Victor stands ready to 
               go. Father pulls him into a back-slapping embrace.

                                     FATHER
                         Write to us often.

               Victor moves on to Justine, takes her hand.

                                     VICTOR
                         We never finished our dance.
                              (she smiles)
                         Someday we shall.

               Next is William. The little boy stands stiffly, tears on his 
               face, trying to be brave. Victor kneels and whispers:

                                     VICTOR
                         The others will look to you while 
                         I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.

               The boy nods miserably, throws his arms around Victor's neck. 
               Last comes Elizabeth. She and Victor regard each other, 
               sharing the secret of last night. A faint smile plays at the 
               corners of her mouth. He kisses her cheek.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               He mounts the carriage. CLAUDE snaps the reins and lurches 
               away, speeding Victor off to his future. Victor turns back 
               for a final look at the home and family he loves so much.

               William runs after him until he's gone from sight...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INGOLSTADT - ESTABLISHING ANGLES - DAY

               High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. Church steeples 
               rising among the rooftops. Beautiful.

               BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               FRAU BRACH trudges heavily up a long, steep, narrow flight 
               of stairs with Victor teetering uneasily behind.

                                     FRAU BRACH
                         No real rooms left. All we've got is 
                         attic space. No one ever wants the 
                         attic space...

               ATTIC SPACE/GARRET - DAY

               She leads him into an immensely long space running a twisted 
               path the entire length of the building; various levels and 
               areas unhindered by wall separation, massive vaulted beams 
               crisscrossing as understructure to the roof. Daylight filters 
               dimly through dozens of dormer windows and skylights coated 
               with grime. Nooks and crannies abound.

                                     VICTOR
                         This will do nicely.

               UNIVERSITY - DAY

               A monumental structure of brick. A BELL TOWER TOLLS. Dead 
               leaves scurry across the lawn.

               LECTURE HALL - DAY

               PROFESSOR KREMPE, a squat little man, paces before the packed 
               galleries of eager young STUDENTS.

                                     KREMPE
                         In science, the letter of fact is 
                         the letter of law. Our pursuit is as 
                         dogmatic as any religious precept. 
                         Think of yourselves as disciples of 
                         a strict and hallowed sect. Someday 
                         you may be priests... but only if 
                         you learn the scripture chapter and 
                         verse.
                              (off their laughter)
                         Any questions?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hand shoots up)
                         But surely, Professor, you don't 
                         intend we disregard the more... 
                         philosophical works.

                                     KREMPE
                         Philosophical?

                                     VICTOR
                         Those which stir the imagination as 
                         well as the intellect. Paracelsus, 
                         for one.

               This reference is lost on all but a few. At the faculty table: 
               PROFESSOR WALDMAN peers up at Victor, adjusting the glasses 
               on his nose. Up among the students: HENRY CLERVAL leans out 
               and shoots an amused look in Victor's direction.

               SCHILLER catches Henry's look and rolls his eyes.

                                     KREMPE
                         Paracelsus?

                                     VICTOR
                         Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius 
                         Agrippa...

                                     KREMPE
                         What is your name?

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor Frankenstein, sir.
                              (no response)
                         Of geneva.

                                     KREMPE
                         Of Geneva.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. 
                         Do you wish to study medicine? Or 
                         mysticism?

               Titters sweep the room. Krempe remains staunchly unamused:

                                     KREMPE
                         Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. 
                         Frankenstein's suggested reading 
                         list... thankfully, that would be 
                         most of you... would be well advised 
                         to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we 
                         concern ourselves with immutable 
                         reality...
                              (specific to Victor)
                         ...not the ravings of lunatics and 
                         alchemists hundreds of years in their 
                         graves. Understood?

               Victor is flushed and humiliated. Held like to say more, but 
               wisely swallows his anger and nods.

                                     KREMPE
                         I am relieved. Are there any relevant 
                         questions?
                              (there are none)
                         Lecture hall dismissed.

               EXT - UNIVERSITY - DAY

               Victor exits wearing a distinctive black greatcoat, fuming 
               over the exchange with Krempe. He strides across the lawn, 
               eyes fixed straight ahead.

               Henry Clerval races up behind him and falls casually in step. 
               Victor glances over. Henry nods pleasantly, as if held been 
               there all along. Victor responds with a curt nod and resumes 
               his straight-ahead demeanor. They walk in silence, just two 
               guys heading in the same direction.

               Henry can't help it; he snickers loudly to himself. Victor 
               shoots him a sharp look. Henry's smirk vanishes, replaced 
               with blank innocence. Did somebody snicker?

                                     HENRY
                         I was just clearing my throat.

                                     VICTOR
                         Very well then.

               They continue walking. Silence thick. Finally:

                                     HENRY
                         You know, you're quite mad.

               Victor stops. Turns.

                                     VICTOR
                              (low, measured)
                         I am not mad.

                                     HENRY
                              (matching Victor's 
                              tone)
                         As a march hare.

               Henry's expression betrays nothing... but perhaps there's a 
               trace of amusement in his eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you having me on?

                                     HENRY
                         Of course I am. It pays to humor the 
                         insane.

               Beat. Victor smiles. Henry grins, offers his hand. Takes it.

                                     HENRY
                         Henry Clerval.

                                     VICTOR
                         Victor, Victor Frankenstein.

                                     HENRY
                         I know. You have a way of making an 
                         impression.

               INT - GASTHOF - DUSK

               The tavern is packed with students and noise. Beer and food 
               served at a frantic pace. We find Victor and Henry at a small 
               table, tearing into sausages and cheese.

                                     VICTOR
                         Do you really think I'm mad?

                                     HENRY
                         Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing 
                         you know, you'll be teaching 
                         toadstools to speak.

               Schiller enters with FRIENDS. They pause at Victor's table

                                     SCHILLER
                         If it isn't the sorcerer. Found 
                         yourself an apprentice?

                                     VICTOR
                         I'm afraid I rejected his application. 
                         He merely dabbles.

                                     HENRY
                         Dilettantes need not apply. What 
                         about you? Schiller, isn't it?

                                     SCHILLER
                         Von Schiller. I'm interested in real 
                         medicine. Treating the sick.

                                     HENRY
                         Really? I myself find sick people 
                         rather revolting.
                              (off their looks)
                         I'm here to secure my degree with a 
                         minimum of fuss and hard work that I 
                         might settle into a life of privilege 
                         treating rich old ladies with gout 
                         and dallying with their daughters.

                                     SCHILLER
                         You two disgust me.

               Schiller and his friends stalk off.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT - DUSK

               LONG LENS magnificently compresses buildings and steeples, 
               distant hills and drizzly sky. Victor wears his greatcoat as 
               he and Henry walk along a twisty cobblestone street.

                                     VICTOR
                         Rich old ladies and their daughters?

                                     HENRY
                         Can you think of a better reason?

                                     VICTOR
                         Quite a few.

                                     HENRY
                         Do me a favor then...
                              (claps his shoulder)
                         ...keep them to yourself.

               Victor takes a shocked beat and bursts into laughter.

               INT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

               Waldman, in sinock, addresses a GROUP OF STUDENTS from across 
               morgue slab. He throws a sheet back to reveal a corpse 
               dissected to reveal the inner workings. The others crowd for 
               a closer look. Victor glances to Henry, who leans back and 
               rolls his eyes in utter disgust.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor sitting at a tall dormer window, 
               writing a letter with quill and ink. It's raining outside. 
               The garret is tidied.

               EXT - RYE FIELDS - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               WORKERS are harvesting for miles around. PAN to Elizabeth 
               and Claude examining the sheaves on a wagon. She cracks the 
               grain and tastes it, glances to Claude. He smiles and nods.

                                     CLAUDE
                         It's turning out to be a good year.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let's return a tenth of the crop to 
                         the tenants.
                              (off his look)
                         They had a hard winter.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Not even your father would be that 
                         generous.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Then there's no need to tell him, is 
                         there?

               Claude grins and motions to his MEN. They resume loading the 
               sheaves as a STABLEBOY rides up:

                                     STABLEBOY
                         Miss! The mail arrived! There's one 
                         from Master Victor!

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN PARLOR - NIGHT

               We find the family gathered around the fire as Elizabeth 
               reads Victor's letter aloud:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         ...and not a day goes by that I do 
                         not cherish your faces in my mind's 
                         eye or ache to see you all again. Be 
                         assured that I am with you in spirit, 
                         and you are never far from my 
                         thoughts. I remain, as always, your 
                         loving and devoted Victor. P.S.

               She pauses, reading ahead.

               INSERT OF LETTER

               The P.S. reads: "Elizabeth... I am holding our vow precious 
               in my heart."

               ELIZABETH

               glances up at their expectant faces.

                                     WILLIE
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It says, give Willie an extra big 
                         hug for me.

                                     WILLIAM
                              (beaming)
                         Read it again?

               She smiles, rearranges the pages as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - UNIVERSITY HALLWAY - DAY

               A classroom door. SHOUTING from within:

                                     VICTOR (O.S.)
                         That's no excuse for being a pompous 
                         ass!

               Victor storms out with Krempe at his heels. Krempe pauses in 
               the doorway, red-faced, bellowing after him:

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll see you thrown out of this 
                         university! I'll go to the dean 
                         himself! Take me at my word, 
                         Frankenstein! The dean himself!

               Classroom doors are opening, faces peering out. Waldman among 
               them. Victor keeps going, doesn't look back.

               INT - GASTHOF - NIGHT

               Victor and Henry slouched at their regular table writes in 
               his thick, well-worn leather journal.

                                     HENRY
                         The entire school heard it. It wasn't 
                         something one could miss.

                                     VICTOR
                         You're a comfort to me, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         What now? Writing about it in your 
                         journal won't help.

                                     VICTOR
                              (quietly)
                         It's a letter to my father.

               Henry falls silent. Victor closes the journal, winds it secure 
               with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of 
               his greatcoat. Brooding. The bell above the door JINGLES. A 
               gust of wind sweeps in. They glance up. Professor Waldman 
               enters, dapper and soft-spoken, impeccably courteous. He 
               murmurs a pleasantry to the INNKEEPER and drifts over to 
               Victor's table.

                                     VICTOR
                         Professor Waldman.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (takes a seat)
                         Victor, explain yourself.

                                     VICTOR
                         Krempe has a way of provoking my 
                         temper.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You have a way of provoking his.
                              (beat)
                         I've been watching you. You seem 
                         impatient with your studies.

                                     VICTOR
                         To say the least. I came here to 
                         expand my mind, but honest inquiry 
                         seems strangled at every turn. All 
                         we do is cling to the old knowledge 
                         instead of seeking the new.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You disdain accepted wisdom?

                                     VICTOR
                         No, I embrace it... as something to 
                         be used or discarded as we advance 
                         the boundaries of what is known.

                                     HENRY
                              (mutters to Waldman)
                         Now you've got him started.

                                     VICTOR
                         These are exciting times, Henry. 
                         We're entering an era of amazing 
                         breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. 
                         He wasn't content to bleed people 
                         with leeches, he pioneered a new 
                         frontier of thought

                                     HENRY
                         ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox 
                         has been virtually eliminated. I've 
                         heard this speech before.

                                     VICTOR
                         But you haven't listened, Never in 
                         history has so much seemed possible. 
                         We're on the verge of answers undreamt 
                         of... but only if we have the courage 
                         to ask the questions.

                                     WALDMAN
                         I understand your frustration. I was 
                         young once myself.
                              (beat)
                         Walk me home. Something I'd like to 
                         show you.

               INT - WALDMAN'S HOME - WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               The gaslights come up with a SOFT HISS. The first thing Victor 
               and Henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to 
               big windows where the light would be best during the day. 
               Easels are lined with in-progress work on a variety of 
               subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, 
               all quite excellent.

               The rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor-to-rafter 
               with arcane equipment. Taking off his coat and rolling up 
               his sleeves, Waldman leads Victor and Henry down rows of 
               tables crammed with experiments and clutter.

                                     WALDMAN
                         You know for thousands of years the 
                         Chinese have based their medical 
                         science on the belief that the human 
                         body is a chemical engine run by 
                         electricity? They say we all contain 
                         streams of energy which flow through 
                         us like currents in the ocean, or 
                         rivers in the earth.

               They arrive at a table. Waldman roots through a tray of 
               knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Their doctors treat patients by 
                         inserting needles like these into 
                         the flesh at various key points to 
                         manipulate these electric streams.

               He directs their attention to an ancient Chinese silk on the 
               wall. It depicts the human body from front and side angles.

               Acupuncture points are clearly marked.

                                     VICTOR
                         Preposterous.

                                     WALDMAN
                         I once saw it done, as a boy in 
                         Canton. My parents were missionaries. 
                         The cure was nothing short of 
                         miraculous.
                              (off their looks)
                         I've never forgotten it. Been 
                         fascinated ever since.

                                     HENRY
                         It smacks of magic.

               Waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal 
               an enormous dead toad in dissection. Copper mounting pins 
               trail wires to a small panel of switches. The switches, in 
               turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries.

               Waldman starts throwing switches. Victor and Henry jump as 
               the toad convulses with motion. They watch, stunned, as 
               Waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet 
               flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?

               Waldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm 
               at the array of wires and batteries.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Electricity.

                                     VICTOR
                         It's utterly fantastic! This is the 
                         sort of thing I'm talking about! We 
                         should be learning this!

                                     WALDMAN
                         Why? God alone knows what it means. 
                         Until it has proven value, it's 
                         nothing more than a ghoulish parlor 
                         trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.

                                     VICTOR
                         But the possibilities. Combining 
                         ancient knowledge with new? Something 
                         like this could change our fundamental 
                         views!

                                     WALDMAN
                         It is a thrilling direction to 
                         explore. Thrilling and dangerous.
                              (off his look)
                         Nature can be wonderful and terrible. 
                         Science is not a realm for the 
                         reckless; it needs a conscience. We 
                         must proceed cautiously. Assess as 
                         we go.
                              (drapes the toad)
                         What I do on my own time is my own 
                         business. The same holds true for 
                         you. You wish to expand your mind? 
                         Fine, do so. You can even join me 
                         here, if you like. But not at the 
                         expense of your normal studies.

                                     VICTOR
                         I doubt that decision is still mine 
                         to make.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (waves)
                         Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an 
                         apology to Professor Krempe...

               Victor starts to object, but Waldman overrides him with a 
               stern gesture for silence. Listen.

                                     WALDMAN
                         "...a sincere and heartfelt apology 
                         which you will then read aloud to 
                         him before the assembled student 
                         body and faculty.

                                     VICTOR
                         Why?

                                     WALDMAN

                         issue of pride? What a waste.

               Waldman hands him the acupuncture needle. A gift. Victor 
               studies it, fascinated.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Go home, Victor. Write the letter,

               DOLLYING VICTOR IN A SWW 360: He stands before the students 
               and faculty, reading his apology.

                                     VICTOR
                         ...and I further wish to extend my 
                         sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe 
                         for my display. My behavior toward 
                         him was both rash and inexcusable.

               Up in the gallery, Krempe nods grudgingly to himself.

               Exquisite silverware goes CLINKING SOFTLY onto polished wood 
               as:

                              (laughing)
                         I knew held get himself in trouble.

               TILT UP to reveal the expansive dinner table being set for 
               guests. KITCHEN STAFF are to-ing and fro-ing. Elizabeth splits 
               her attention between supervising and reading Victor's letter, 
               while Justine busies herself with a flower arrangement. Willie 
               gets underfoot. Father just sits.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Must've been a terrible row.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He was almost expelled for calling 
                         one of his professors a "pompous...
                              (glances to Willie)
                         Fellow..." 

                                     FATHER
                         He always was opinionated.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (reads on, laughs)
                         He set things right with a proper 
                         apology... and now they've put him 
                         in charge of dissection lab!

                                     WILLIE
                         What's that?

                                     FATHER
                         That's where they cut things open 
                         and peer about inside.

                                     WILLIE
                         Things? What sort of things?

               Father is about to press on with the gory details, but 
               Elizabeth freezes him with a glance.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's far too ghoulish for your young 
                         ears.

               The old man throws Willie a look. We'll talk later.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         The point is, your brother is a 
                         brilliant student well on his way to

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               A DISSECTED DOG convulses through its electronically-induced 
               paces. Kicking. Twitching. Tasting the air with its dead 
               tongue. TILT UP to reveal Victor at the switch.

               Waldman leans close to observe. Softly:

                                     WALDMAN
                         Re-configure the leads?

                                     VICTOR
                         Numbers four and twelve directly 
                         into the nervous system?

               Waldman nods.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Worth a try.

               INT - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

               With Waldman at his side and Henry providing the tools as 
               needed, Victor instructs a freshman class in the internal 
               workings of a dissected corpse. Professor Krempe observes 
               from a distance.

                                     VICTOR
                         ...and the medulla oblongata is the 
                         transition between the spinal cord 
                         and the two parts I've already 
                         named... cerebrum and cerebellum. 
                         Any freshmen feeling queasy yet?
                              (glances around, smiles)
                         All of you, from the look of it. 
                         We'll resume your torture tomorrow.

               He waves them dismissed. They laugh and exit, relieved.

               Waldman squeezes Victor's elbow. Well done. Victor stiffens 
               at Krempe's approach.

                                     KREMPE
                         You seem to be adapting well to the 
                         approved curriculum.

                                     VICTOR
                         Despite the lack of challenge.

               Krempe reddens, but says nothing. He gives Waldman a curt 
               nod and walks off.

                                     WALDMAN
                         Victor. He was trying to be gracious.

                                     VICTOR
                         The strain was evident.

                                     HENRY
                         Come now, you must take some 
                         satisfaction. You've risen to the 
                         top of your class. A position of 
                         prominence and regard.

               Victor weighs this, glances at both of them, smiles.

                                     VICTOR
                         What keeps me going are my friends.

               He throws his arm around Henry's neck, pulls him into an 
               affectionate headlock. Henry struggles and laughs:

                                     HENRY
                         Leave off!

               JEWELER'S SHOP - DAY

               Victor is gazing with reverence at a gorgeous oval locket 
               dangled before him by a smiling JEWELER. He glances to Henry 
               for an opinion.

                                     HENRY
                         Your Elizabeth must be quite a 
                         treasure, Victor
                              (pointedly to jeweler)
                         ...to justify these prices.

               The jeweler's smile goes frosty.

               WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               TIGHT ANGLE ON the locket lying open against canvas, dangling 
               from an easel frame. TILT DOWN to reveal a magnificent 
               miniature oil portrait of Victor in progress, no more than 
               three inches high within its penciled oval.

               Waldman paints with an extraordinarily delicate touch, 
               jeweler's glasses riding low on his nose, eyes unnaturally 
               large behind the magnifying lenses. Victor sits patiently 
               for the portrait, suffused with daylight.

               Henry leans in over Waldman's shoulder, studying the portrait. 
               Waldman stiffens a bit, aware of his presence. He clearly 
               hates people looking over his shoulder.

                                     HENRY
                              (deadpan)
                         Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?

               Waldman heaves a long-suffering sigh. He abruptly jabs his 
               brush at Henry's nose, daubing it with paint. Dignity upheld 
               he resumes his careful work as Victor laughs.

               INT - WALDMAN'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Victor, Waldman, and Henry are gathered around the remains 
               of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's 
               company. Cigars are lit, wine is flowing. Conversation is 
               fast and loose, intense and passionate:

                                     WALDMAN
                         I'm quite serious. Look at all the 
                         charity and clinic work we do. Up 
                         until thirty years ago, the concept 
                         of vaccine was unheard of.

                                     HENRY
                         You're saying all disease will 
                         eventually be eradicated?

                                     WALDMAN
                         I'm convinced. Not by treating 
                         symptoms, but by diving nature's 
                         most jealously-guarded secrets.

                                     HENRY
                              (turning serious)
                         Do you foresee this happening in our 
                         lifetimes?

                                     WALDMAN
                         No. But someday.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.

               A HOWL OF OUTRAGE AND LAUGHTER. Victor flings his napkin in 
               Henry's face.

                                     VICTOR
                         Only you would think of that!

                                     HENRY
                              (laughing)
                         Somebody has to!

               Victor raises his wine glass. The others join. A toast.

                                     VICTOR
                         I tell you what we need, my friends. 
                         Forget the symptoms and diseases. 
                         What we need is a vaccine for death 
                         itself.

                                     WALDMAN
                              (laughter)
                         Oh, now you have gone too far. There's 
                         only one God, Victor.

                                     HENRY
                              (raises his glass)
                         And here's to Him. Everything in 
                         moderation, Frankenstein.

                                     VICTOR
                              (grins)
                         Nothing in moderation, Clerval.

               INT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               CAMERA, TRACKS the gritty reality of a big-city poor house, 
               crammed with society's dregs: the poor, the uneducated, 
               wailing babies, stampeding children. Absolutely jangling 
               with noise and confusion... loud and stifling... people 
               getting eye-ear-nose-throat exams... being vaccinated...

               The "doctors" in attendance are all Ingolstadt STUDENTS 
               performing community service, none of whom look like they're 
               enjoying it. Schiller looks particularly harried. We find 
               Victor and Henry giving out vaccinations. They keep glancing 
               over their shoulders at Waldman as he gets further embroiled 
               in a no-win argument with a wiry, ferret-faced MAN terrified 
               about getting his vaccination:

                                     MAN
                         Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox 
                         in it, I hear tell!

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Pox? They givin' us pox?

               Ripples of panic spread. Waldman is as tense and clipped as 
               we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper 
               amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad-lib dialogue:

                                     WALDMAN
                         No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...

                                     FAT WOMAN
                         Vaca-what?

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...vaccine, from the Latin vacca, 
                         meaning cow
                              (glances at her girth)
                         ...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...

                                     MAN
                         I told you there was pox in it!

                                     WALDMAN
                         ...no, no, cowpox in a minute 
                         quantity, perfectly harmless, gives 
                         you a natural immunity to small ox, 
                         which is the point of this whole 
                         bloody exercise...

               Victor and Henry are pausing work. Concerned. Drifting closer. 
               The ferret-faced man is cornered.

                                     MAN
                         You doctors kill people! I don' care 
                         what you say, you ain't stickin' it 
                         in me!

                                     WALDMAN
                         I most assuredly am! It prevents 
                         disease and it's the law! Why am I 
                         explaining myself? Somebody restrain 
                         this damn fool!

               It happens this fast: There's an innocuous blur of motion as 
               the man seems to tap Waldman lightly in the stomach, then he 
               darts away, slamming past Victor and Henry. Victor looks 
               after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. 
               He glances down. A thin knife. Victor looks to Waldman. 
               Puzzled. It still hasn't really dawned.

               Waldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed 
               to his sternum, lips tight. He looks more annoyed than 
               anything else. He exhales slowly.

                                     HENRY
                         Professor?

                                     WALDMAN
                              (softly)
                         Oh God.

               That's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers. 
               They catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls 
               to the floor. People are pushing and crowding to see.

               EXT - POOR HOUSE - DAY

               A cobblestoned street-scene. Carriage. A delivery wagon. 
               Vendors. Pedestrians. The doors of the poor house burst open, 
               releasing a frenzy into the street: Victor and Henry carrying 
               Waldman by his arms and legs, all the students running 
               alongside, some of them weeping with panic, the crowd at 
               their heels still trying to catch a glimpse, pedestrians 
               scattering, the students dwindling up the long winding street, 
               bearing their professor toward the school, shouting for 
               help...

               INT - UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - DAY

               Krempe delivers the eulogy before the open casket. The chapel 
               is full. Victor is seated near the back. Dazed. Henry comes 
               up the aisle and slides in next to him. Victor doesn't even 
               glance over. Henry whispers:

                                     HENRY
                         They just caught the man who did it.

                                     VICTOR
                         He was a frightened soul who acted 
                         out of fear and ignorance.

                                     HENRY
                         They'll hang him all the same.

                                     VICTOR
                         Good. I'll be there to hear his 
                         worthless neck snap.

               People glance back. Henry lays his hand on Victor's elbow.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep your voice down. You don't know 
                         what you're saying.

                                     VICTOR
                         It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't 
                         have happened! The bastard deserves 
                         to die.

               Victor is causing ripples of attention throughout the chapel. 
               Even Krempe falters briefly in his eulogy. Henry pulls Victor 
               from the pew, drags him up the aisle...

               INT - CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY

               ...and into the confessional where they launch at each other 
               in harsh whispers.

               Dialogue here is overlapping and intense:

                                     HENRY
                         You're making a scene!

                                     VICTOR
                         Why Waldman? He of all people should 
                         have cheated death!

                                     HENRY
                         You can't. Death is God's will!

                                     VICTOR
                         I resent God's monopoly.

                                     HENRY
                         That's blasphemy!

                                     VICTOR
                         Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent 
                         his life trying to help people!

                                     HENRY
                         All the more reason for us to continue 
                         his work with the poor!

                                     VICTOR
                              (beat, low)
                         No. He had more important work.

                                     HENRY
                         There are sick people who need our 
                         help. Here and now. Not in some future 
                         time. Consider that.

               Henry exits. Victor tries to compose himself, clasping his 
               hands together as if in prayer... or quiet rage. He gazes 
               up. There on the wall hangs a crucifix.

                                     VICTOR
                         Life and death.
                              (beat)
                         Why should You alone have the final 
                         say?

               VICTOR'S POV PUSHING SLOWLY IN on the Christ figure before 
               him, bleeding from a crown of thorns, arms thrown wide.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               DA VINCI'S STUDY OF MAN rises from the image of Christ, 
               striking an eerily similar pose, arms thrown wide within the 
               perfect circle. We hear a DOOR BEING UNLOCKED as...

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - DAY

               ...a WIDER ANGLE reveals the deserted workshop. The door 
               swings open as Victor lets himself in. He sees the finished 
               locket lying open on a table, picks it up, studies the 
               beautiful miniature portrait it contains. Snaps it shut.

               He looks up, eyes falling upon the Da Vinci print hanging on 
               the wall. He stares. Intense.

               INT - WALDMAN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

               TRACKING SHOT: Things are in the process of being sorted and 
               boxed. We find Victor poring over Waldman's notes:

                                     VICTOR
                         To understand the causes of life, we 
                         must first have recourse to death... 
                         and examine the process in minutest 
                         detail...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               A gray day. Waldman's ferret-faced MURDERER stands weeping 
               helplessly on the scaffold as sentence is read:

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         ...his body to be left on public 
                         display for a twenty-four hour period, 
                         thereafter to be consigned to an 
                         unmarked pauper's grave. So the court 
                         has spoken.

               The EXECUTIONER draws the hood over the murderer's head, 
               cinches the noose tight. The condemned man is blubbering, 
               pleading for his life.

               Victor stands in the crowd. Watching. Waiting. We hear the 
               THUMP of the body dropping, the CRACK of a snapping neck...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               Dark as Hades. Pissing down rain. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING and a 
               CRASH OF THUNDER. The dead man still hangs from the scaffold, 
               lashed by the wind.

               Victor looms from the storm, hands jammed in the pocket of 
               his greatcoat. He pulls out a thin, glittering blade. The 
               very weapon which took Waldman's life. He gazes up at the 
               dead man... at the rope from which he dangles...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The dead murderer lies pale and naked on a slab. Victor leans 
               close, still dripping, studying the face closely. A FLASH OF 
               LIGHTNING throws wild, skittering shadows through the dormer 
               windows and skylights. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         No longer pathetic and useless

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               The dead man, dissected and wired, jerks bolt upright, 
               flopping and convulsing, eyes opening and closing, mouth 
               gaping open and shut. He falls back limply as Victor shuts 
               the power off, making careful notations in his journal.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               TRACKING the dissection table... up the length of the 
               murderer's body... now in an advanced stage of decay... we 
               hear the SOFT BUZZING of flies...

               We find Victor standing over the corpse. Gaunt and hollow- 
               eyed. Exhausted and obsessed. Wearing a butcher's apron. 
               Staring down at one of the dead man's forearms. Maggots are 
               swarming in the flesh. He abruptly raises a cleaver and WHACKS 
               it off at the elbow.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING SLOWLY past the forearm lying in a steel pan, we 
               find Victor performing an intense chemical analysis. Dead 
               tissues are breaking apart in solvents, distilled over a 
               slow-burning flame. Victor smears a glass slide, places it 
               under a microscope.

               INT - GASTHOF - DAY

               Victor is hunched over his notebook, pale and unhealthy, 
               scribbling notations next to a rendering of the human form. 
               Henry is across from him:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor. This has got to stop.
                              (Victor glances up)
                         Nobody's seen you in months. You 
                         haven't attended a single class.

                                     VICTOR
                         I've been preoccupied.

                                     HENRY
                         We all know how hard you took 
                         Waldman's death. Even Krempe is 
                         sympathetic. But it is time to move 
                         on. It is time to concern yourself 
                         with life.

                                     VICTOR
                         That is my concern.
                              (faint smile)
                         I'm involved in something just now. 
                         I want to finish it in Waldman's 
                         memory.

                                     HENRY
                         How much longer?

                                     VICTOR
                         Few months perhaps. I'm gathering 
                         the raw materials even now.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               The wrought-iron doors of a crypt have been forced open.

               CAMERA PUSHES through to find Victor standing inside over a 
               stone sarcophagus with a pry bar in his hands. He's nervous, 
               working up his courage:

                                     VICTOR
                         Materials. That's all they are Tissue 
                         to be re-used.

               He pries off the stone lid. It THUMPS heavily to the floor, 
               cracking in half. He opens the casket, reaches in, raises 
               the pale arm of the deceased to inspect it.

               EXT - GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Stone monuments. Bare trees. Ivy-covered ground. Victor 
               shoulder-deep in a grave. Shoveling. A lamp burns low.

               COFFIN - NIGHT

               Pitch black. The lid swings open, cascading dust and soil. 
               Victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               TRACKING ALONG the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde 
               jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional 
               head staring through the glass, dead cats...

               ...and we find Victor working into the wee hours. Hunched 
               over his specimens. Candle flame flickering low. Referring 
               back to Waldman's notes. Making notations in arcane books 
               such as "De Occulta Philosophia," by Agrippa, and "Le Sciences 
               et les arts D'alchimiste," by Paracelsus.

               FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               A magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue 
               sky. TILT DOWN to Elizabeth and Justine with the mansion 
               distant. A steady breeze ripples the fields as Elizabeth 
               regards a stack of mail.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Nothing. Still nothing.

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's been months. It's not like him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Something's wrong. I know it.
                              (off her look)
                         I've heard rumors of cholera spreading 
                         south from Hamburg.

                                     JUSTINE
                         So have I

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I should go. I should leave today.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into 
                         Germany would be banned. You'd never 
                         get near Ingolstadt.
                              (beat)
                         Besides, they're only rumors.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (beat, nods)
                         And not a word of them to Father. 
                         He's agitated enough not hearing 
                         from Victor.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Read him one of the old letters and 
                         rephrase it. We'll say it came today. 
                         It'll set his mind at ease.

               Elizabeth gives her a hug. They walk toward the mansion

               INT - BLACKSMITH SHOP - DAY

               Murky and dark. Bellows are pumping. Showers of sparks 
               cascade. The BLACKSMITH and his ASSISTANT are pounding a 
               metallic sledgehammer litany, beating a huge copper sheet 
               into shape. Victor enters. The blacksmith directs his 
               attention to a finished copper piece leaning against the 
               wall. Victor runs his hand over the surface. Nice.

               INT - MATERNITY WARD - CHARITY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               A WOMAN lies on a table, screaming as she goes into labor. 
               Her water breaks, cascading into a steel bucket. One of the 
               ASSISTANTS snatches it up, scurries around the corner. Victor 
               is waiting in the shadows. Money changes hands.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor is examining the amniotic fluid. Boiling it off. 
               Working to synthesize it.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pours the final drum of fluid into what appears to be 
               a large copper vat. He dips his hand in, examines the 
               consistency and smell. ANGLE WIDENS, spinning slowly up to 
               reveal that the vat is human in shape. A sarcophagus.

               EXT - ALLEY - NIGHT

               We find Victor examining three corpses on the back of a wagon, 
               checking nostrils and teeth with gloved hands. A PAIR OF MEN 
               lurk in the shadows, waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                         That one.

               The corpse is lifted off. Money changes hands.

                                     MAN
                         With this cholera come to town, we'll 
                         have plenty more for you.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor wearing elbow-length gloves, hacking furiously away 
               with a bone saw. Tossing aside the scraps.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor has an arm wired, testing reactions. He scrapes off a 
               small shred of tissue, drops it in solution, watches it break 
               apart. It doesn't look good. He glances feverishly at the 
               clock, makes a fast decision, scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Not optimal. Must use. No time to 
                         replace. Body can't wait.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor stitches a torso with one of those big, awful curved 
               needles, yanking up hard to draw the catgut tight.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I stitched it together with my own 
                         hands...

               VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor pulls on a chain, hoisting the body off the slab via 
               block-and-tackle mounted on a ceiling track. The body rises 
               limply into the air, spinning slowly, arms and legs dangling, 
               long black hair covering its face.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         A patchwork man of my own devising.

               Victor reaches up with one hand to stop the body spinning.

               He pushes it down the length of the lab, rolling it along 
               its ceiling track like a side of beef in a meat locker.

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               The Creature lies on an improvised bier of crates, surrounded 
               by shadows and clutter, draped/sprawled like Christ taken 
               from the cross in Michelangelo's "Pieta."

               Beakers bubbling and dripping. Intravenous lines seeping and 
               secreting. A misty chemical haze in the air.  Victor is 
               watching his patchwork man. Glowering. Waiting.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         It took nutrients like a child 
                         receiving milk... blushed like a 
                         young girl with the blood I forced 
                         through its veins...

               A FLASH OF LIGHTNING rips through the skylights, bathing the 
               scene purple/white. Eerier and eerier.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         ...all in preparation.

               VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY

               We find Victor passed out in a chair. His creation is still 
               taking fluids. Gray daylight streams through the windows.

               There's commotion in the street outside: shouting, horses' 
               hooves clattering on cobblestone, an occasional scream or 
               wail. Victor doesn't stir. Dead to the world. Somebody starts 
               POUNDING on the door. Victor rouses, takes a moment to 
               remember where he is. He lurches from his chair, grabs a 
               canvas tarp, throws it over his "patchwork man."

               STAIRWELL - DAY

               Henry is pounding. Finally the latch is drawn. The door swings 
               open a crack. Victor peers out. Gaunt and furtive. Suspicious. 
               Henry is stunned at his dissipated appearance.

                                     HENRY
                         God's sake, what is that stench?

               Henry peers past him.

               Victor shifts, blocking his view

                                     VICTOR
                         This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy 
                         just now. What do you want?

                                     HENRY
                         Things have gone worse with this 
                         cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases 
                         a day now. Classes have been 
                         suspended. University's shut down.

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes? And?

                                     HENRY
                         Listen to what I'm saying. The 
                         militia's arriving to quarantine the 
                         city. Most of us are getting out 
                         while we still can.

                                     VICTOR
                         You'll be leaving then.
                              (beat)
                         Just as well. You never were cut out 
                         for this, Henry. Goodbye.

               And the door slams shut. The bolt is thrown. Henry pounds.

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO 
                         REASON!

               Nothing. Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and 
               heads back down the stairs.

               EXT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - STREET - DAY

               Henry exits into a nightmare. REFUGEES are streaming from 
               the city, horses and wagons, people on foot, carrying their 
               possessions. Henry steps into the street and is nearly run 
               down by a carriage.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         OUT OF THE WAY!

               Henry glances up to see Schiller at the reins, struggling to 
               control the animals as the carriage eases past.

                                     HENRY
                         Schiller? You're leaving? Where's 
                         all that high talk about treating 
                         the sick?

                                     SCHILLER
                              (icy)
                         To hell with them. And you.

               He snaps the reins, not caring who he runs down. The carriage 
               lurches away, scattering refugees before it.

               Henry keeps walking. Jostled by the hostile crowd. Looking 
               around. Dazed. Dead bodies are stacked along the street like 
               cordwood, waiting for the death carts. ANGLE WIDENS as Henry 
               stumbles along through utter despair and devastation, stunned 
               at the human suffering around him as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Victor glances at the clock. Scribbles in his journal:

                                     VICTOR
                         Time running out. Rate of decay 
                         accelerating. Must strike now... or 
                         start again from scratch.

               He gazes down at his creation, lying once again on the slab 
               before him... but now the Creature lies on a full body-length 
               steel grate. Steel chains with hooks dangle from the ceiling 
               above... along with long coils of thick copper wire tipped 
               with glittering needles big enough to knit with.

               Victor glances up at the Da Vinci. The Study of Man has been 
               daubed with red paint at key acupuncture points. Victor dips 
               a huge cotton swab in a bowl of iodine, starts dabbing 
               identical marks on the body before him...

               Now he's ramming the huge wire-fed needles deep into these 
               spots, brutally working them around in the flesh to get good 
               contact. The forearms, the neck, the rib cage...

               Now he's attaching the steel chain-hooks to the four corners 
               of the steel grate...

               Now he's pulling on a rope, straining to hoist the whole rig 
               into the air. It lifts slowly from frame: body, needles, 
               wires and all...

               HIGH WIDE ANGLE

               ...and we get our first spectacular look at Frankenstein's 
               gloriously low-tech and stupendously arcane lab. The Creature 
               dangles below us from the ceiling-hoist, lying full-length 
               and horizontal on its steel grate, spinning slowly, thick 
               copper wires trailing from its arms and legs, rib cage and 
               neck, armpits and groin. The copper cables trail upward, 
               coil along the ceiling like garden hose to provide necessary 
               slack, meander down the wall to culminate in a splendiferous 
               array of galvanic batteries, steam engines and generators. 

               Frankenstein reaches slowly up, fingertips straining toward 
               the ceiling as if worshipping the creation revolving endlessly 
               above his head in a perfectly-described circle not at all 
               unlike the Da Vinci...

               And he grabs the lever on the platform and pulls to start it 
               spinning, with a mighty heave, he sets the whole thing gliding 
               in motion, CAMERA TRACKING FASTER AND FASTER as he rolls it 
               along the ceiling track through the lab, passing table after 
               table of desiccated leftovers and discarded scraps, LIGHTNING 
               BLAZING through the windows to mark his way with wild and 
               sinister shadows...

               ...and he yanks the platform to a stop over the copper 
               sarcophagus. Amniotic fluid steaming and murky within. He 
               positions the platform, unties the rope, lowers the Creature 
               down and down, lower and lower, sinking into the vat, the 
               steel grate a perfect fit in size and shape.

               Faster now, moving furiously. Reaching into the murk, 
               unhooking the chains. Arraying the copper wire through air- 
               tight guide holes. Spinning on his heels and reaching up, 
               grabbing hold of the upper shell of the sarcophagus also 
               suspended from the ceiling, stunningly heavy, gleaming with 
               reflections and secrets. CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN on Victor as he 
               swings the upper shell into position, lowers it into place 
               with a THUD-CLANK! Working the wing-nuts on the bolts, 
               spinning frantically, tightening them down, sealing the 
               sarcophagus air-tight. Faster now. Faster.

               The frenzy builds and the CAMERA GOES WILD, rocketing, 
               zooming, gliding, spinning the audience on its ear:

               Frankenstein. Turning up the heat on the burners. Cooking 
               the copper from below. Double double, toil and trouble.

               Frankenstein. Gazing through the thick glass portholes 
               checking on his creation drifting in the murk.

               Frankenstein. Whipping up the galvanic batteries, 
               supercharging them with steam generators. Watching as they 
               send voltage humming and throbbing through the copper cables 
               along the ceiling beams. Building up a charge.

               Frankenstein. Gazing at his gleaming handiwork. LIGHTNING 
               painting his features into a twisted mask. Hand on the switch. 
               Ready to rev it up and throw the throttle.

               Over it goes. WHAM! Overdrive.

               The body convulses violently in its copper womb as the first 
               jolt of electricity hits. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK! Blazing with 
               energy and arcane light, fingers of light throbbing through 
               the portholes, sparkling, glittering, seeking.

               Frankenstein races to the sarcophagus. A long glass tube, 
               two feet in diameter and ribbed with steel, gets lowered on 
               a boom and rammed into a hole, collate spun tight, inner dam 
               wrenched out like a Polaroid plate.

               He reaches up and grabs holds of a pull-chain, fingers going 
               knuckle-white on the wooden handle. One hard yank. A dump- 
               tank is released, murky water cascading down the glass tube. 
               And here's the final perversion, the ultimate icing on this 
               twisted cake: the copper sarcophagus is literally a womb, 
               with the giant glass tube serving as a massive gleaming 
               phallus down which come pouring dozens of electric eels, 
               wriggling and streaming like huge black sperm...

               EEL POV (IN THE TUBE)

               ...rocketing down the tube, slithering and squirming, faster 
               and faster, racing into the sarcophagus, seeking out the 
               creation in the murky womb-fluid, lashing at the hapless 
               gray flesh, zapping it again with high-intensity voltage. 
               The Creature convulsing, thrashing, jerking from side to 
               side, raising its head against the top, mouth gaping open 
               and shut, jaws snapping with electrical surges.

               Frankenstein's face appears at the porthole, peering in, 
               watching his dark seed fertilize his unholy child.

                                     VICTOR
                              (muffled through the 
                              glass)
                         Live, you bastard!

               A huge bony hand slaps against the porthole, fingers clawing 
               and spasming against the glass.

               FRANKENSTEIN jerks his head back, stunned. The fingers are 
               scratching. He turns, runs to the electrical rig, shutting 
               the whole thing down. It cycles off, whining into silence

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...and the body relaxes, shutting down with it, going limp 
               and lifeless in the murk, spasms trailing off.

               FRANKENSTEIN stares at the sarcophagus. Realizing his creation 
               has stopped moving. Nothing now. He sags to his knees, utterly 
               devastated at the loss of his dream. Nothing.

               It was all for nothing...

               INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS

               ...And The Creature opens its dim yellow eyes, aware. Its 
               mouth goes wide, teeth bared in a silent scream as it tries 
               to breathe and finds nothing in its lungs but fluid.

               FRANKENSTEIN is wrapped in his despair, face cradled in his 
               hands. A SOFT TAP. He glances over his fingers. Thinking he 
               imagined it. No. There's another tap. And another.

               We see it in his eyes. Sheer joy and stunned exultation.

               Triumph and wonder unbelievably sublime. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's alive. It's alive.

               And then hell breaks loose: Massive convulsions wrack the 
               sarcophagus, damn near shaking it off its cradle. THUMP- 
               THUMP-THUMP! Pounding from within. Head ramming against the 
               inner lid. He races over, frantic, fingers fumbling on the 
               wing-nuts, spinning them loose, trying to free the drowning 
               man within. He unscrews the final bolt, reaches for the rope 
               to hoist the lid away...

               ...and the lid launches itself across the room, propelled 
               from below with rocket-booster force. The massive copper 
               shell goes hurtling/spinning/cartwheeling across the lab, 
               demolishing an amazing array of equipment in its path, and 
               thunders massively off the wall in an explosion of masonry 
               and splintering coat rack. Victor's greatcoat goes flying.

               Silence. Frankenstein is frozen. Staring at the roiling 
               surface of the amniotic fluid as it settles. An eternity 
               passes in the space of a heartbeat.

               The Creature erupts from the vat like a vision from Hell, 
               thrashing and gagging. Murky fluid cascading in all 
               directions. The Creature seizes Victor by the shirtfront, 
               trying to pull itself from the vat, slipping and sliding 
               like an epileptic in a bathtub full of oil, damn near dragging 
               Victor in, eels leaping and frothing and crackling with 
               electricity. Victor screaming, trying to pull away, trying 
               to break the Creature's grip...

               ...and the whole thing tips over. Victor reels back, falling 
               as the vat SLAMS to the ground, cascading its murky contents, 
               washing the Creature limply across the floor like a body 
               tossed from the ocean, eels flipping and flopping, snapping 
               electrical discharges into the air. Victor scrambles back, 
               slipping and sliding on the amniotic muck, desperately jerking 
               his legs away. He finds his traction and scrambles to his 
               feet.

               The Creature is grasping and crawling toward him. Flopping 
               and jerking. Gripped by seizures and convulsions. Vomiting 
               murky liquid as his lungs heave grotesquely to dispel the 
               fluid. Swiping the air with palsied hands. Malfunctional.

               VICTOR stands dripping fluid and goo, chest heaving, staring 
               down at the Creature, not quite able to believe he was midwife 
               to this ghastly birth. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         What have I done?

               The Creature lunges to its knees, grasping him, clutching 
               his clothes, pawing him.

                                     VICTOR
                         LET GO OF ME!

               Victor can't break free. Panicking. He snatches a hammer 
               from a nearby table and brings it down on the Creature's 
               head. THUD! Again and again. Beating the thing down, pounding 
               it into submission. The Creature finally collapses, sliding 
               down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus, twitching and 
               jerking in its own afterbirth.

               Silence now.

               A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined 
               lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a 
               dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room, 
               jerking wild shadows across the walls.

               Victor steps over the Creature. Dazed. He drops the hammer. 
               It clatters to the floor. He stops to jot a final entry:

                                     VICTOR
                         Massive birth defects. Result is 
                         malfunctional and vile.
                              (beat)
                         Have chosen to abort.

               He walks stiffly away, disappears into the bedroom...

               INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               ...where he staggers to the canopied bed, beyond exhausted, 
               and collapses face-down into oblivion. Weeping.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The wee hours. Rain pattering desolately on the roof. Victor 
               sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. Through a crack in 
               the bed curtains, we see the bedroom door slowly creak open, 
               throwing a twisted spill of light. A shadow appears.

               Entering. Shambling and gliding across the floor. Silent and 
               furtive. Creeping toward the bed.

               PUSHING SLOWLY IN on Victor. Moving into close-up. Sleeping.

               Unaware. The shadow falls across his face. Beat. His eyes 
               fly open. An intake of breath. Paralyzed.

               Sensing the presence. Feeling the shadow. Working himself up 
               to something. Perhaps a scream. He can stand it no longer, 
               thrusts out his arm, jerks the curtain aside...

               ...and the Creature is there, Looming like a specter of death. 
               Naked. Beseeching. Dull yellow eyes trying to understand. 
               Victor lurches from bed, sends a nightstand and vase CRASHING 
               to the floor. The Creature circles, seeking him, threatening 
               to cut off his path to the door.

                                     VICTOR
                         Stay away!

               He darts past the thing, careening out into the lab. The 
               Creature whips around, unsteady for a moment, then follows 
               him with surprising speed.

               INT - LAB - NIGHT

               Victor races through the lab with the Creature hobbling 
               behind, trying to catch up. Victor hurling lab equipment, 
               tipping shelves in its path, anything to slow it down.

               Victor rips the door open, lunges through, slams it in the 
               Creature's face. The Creature presses against the wood with 
               pathetic little moans, begging not to be left alone.

               He sinks to the floor. Abandoned. Shivering with cold. Sees 
               Victor's greatcoat where it fell. Grabs it. Drags it over. 
               Shrouding himself.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races into the downpour, soaked to the skin in seconds, 
               mind racing. He needs a plan. He presses on.

               INT - SHOP - NIGHT

               Victor appears at the window. TILT DOWN to reveal an array 
               of gleaming swords lying in their velvet display. Victor 
               hurls a brick through the glass. Snatches up a sword.

               INT - VICTOR'S BUILDING - NIGHT

               Victor careens in from the storm, drenched, racing up the 
               stairs, sword glittering in his grasp. He gets to the top of 
               the stairs...

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               ...only to discover the door torn off it's hinges. He enters, 
               stunned. The thing is gone.

               EXT - STREET - NIGHT

               Victor races back into the storm. Searching. Slogging grimly 
               on. Lashed by the wind and rain. Mocked by the lightning. 
               He'll never give up. Not until he finds the thing and takes 
               back the life he gave it. He dwindles from view, vanishing 
               into the gale as we

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT - ALLEY - MORNING

               Gray and drizzly. Heaps of wet garbage. Crawling rats. There's 
               a shifting, heaving motion. The vermin scatter as the waking 
               Creature peers at the world from beneath the greatcoat like 
               a frightened child peering from under a blanket. Lost and 
               confused.

               He scrabbles through the garbage for something to eat. He 
               finds a rotted scrap, chews it anxiously. Ravenous.

               TWO FERAL DOGS appear, grizzled denizens of the city's gutters 
               and back-alleys, peering with insolent eyes. Watching him 
               eat. Assessing his potential as a threat. The Creature stares 
               ingenuously back. Not knowing to be afraid.

               The lead dog curls his lips back with a guttural SNARL. The 
               Creature draws back sharply with a fearful MOAN. That's all 
               it takes. The dogs are on him, snarling and snapping, the 
               food torn from his hands. The dogs dart away, growling and 
               fighting over the scrap.

               The Creature is left whimpering and shaken. He pushes to his 
               feet and hurries in the opposite direction, legs bare and 
               pale beneath the swirling greatcoat, clutching his collar 
               against the cold. He hears a distant CLANGING.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out 
                         your deeeaaad!

               A death cart clatters slowly past the mouth of the alley, 
               DRIVER ringing his bell. It makes no sense to the Creature, 
               but it's a sign of human life. He presses on...

               EXT - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               ...and emerges into the square as ANGLE WIDENS. There's a 
               fair amount of activity. People are still leaving the city, 
               though the earlier flood has thinned. Some citizens are still 
               trying to go about their normal lives. VENDORS are calling 
               out, selling food. The Creature moves through the square, 
               unnoticed, just another figure mingling with the flow. People 
               trudge along, eyes downcast, miseries great, paying little 
               attention.

               The Creature pauses, sniffing the air. An aroma draws him to 
               a vendor's stand. Loaves of bread are laid out. He hunches 
               down to smell one, picks it up, bites off a chunk. Chewing.

               It's good. A bigger bite. Snatching up more.

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Here! What do you think you're doing?

               The Creature glances up. The VENDOR'S WIFE is within arm's 
               reach, breath catching in her throat at the sight of him.

               Mouth gaping. Too stunned to scream.

               The Creature cradles the loaves to his chest, terrified she's 
               going to take them away. He remembers his recent experience 
               with the dogs and decides to try out the lesson he learned: 
               he curls his lips back and snarls.

               He's rewarded with a PIERCING SHRIEK. The Creature jumps 
               back, startled. This wasn't the desired effect. The woman 
               SCREAMS like she'll never stop. He turns to run away...

               ...and plows right into the stream of refugees. He goes 
               sprawling, scraping his knees bloody, still clutching his 
               loaves. Confusion all around. People converge angrily. A 
               ROUGH MAN grabs his hair, jerking him upright...

                                     ROUGH MAN
                         Stupid bastard!

               ...and the Creature staggers to his feet before them, 
               whimpering to protect his food, showing his face to all. 
               Screams and panic. The Creature whips around, seeing horrified 
               faces on all sides...

               He's the cholera! He's the one been spreadin' the plague!

               ...faces which turn into an angry mob, glaring sheer hatred. 
               Somebody hits him in the face with a heavy stick, spinning 
               him to the ground, loaves of bread scattering. They surround 
               him, hitting, flailing, throwing stones. He tries to crawl, 
               whimpering for them to stop.

                                     VENDOR'S WIFE
                         BURN HIM! BURN HIM!

               The Creature finds himself hoisted into the air, falling 
               back onto a sea of hands, kicking and screaming as the mob 
               sweeps him across the square like some pagan sacrifice. He 
               gets tossed onto the hard cobblestone in a thrashing heap, 
               scrambles to his knees as the crowd surrounds him. He's 
               wailing with terror now, long inhuman howls of fear. Men 
               start flinging lamp oil, spattering him, blinding him. A 
               torch is lit, swung toward him. Feel the heat.

               The Creature lunges to his feet, panic and terror complete 
               bulldozing through the crowd to get away from the torch, 
               bowling people over, scattering them in all directions. He 
               breaks free, hobbling wildly across the square, greatcoat 
               billowing. The mob streams after him, thirsty for blood, 
               hurling rocks and sticks.

               EXT - STREETS/ALLEYS - DAY

               The Creature is weeping as he runs, bleeding from his many 
               cuts and bruises. He turns a corner, collapses against a 
               wall to catch his breath. He can hear them coming, shouting. 
               They'll be here any second.

               He sees a death cart heaped with bodies. He hurls himself up 
               on the cart to conceal himself among the putrefying corpses. 
               The crowd streams past the mouth of the alley. The death 
               cart WORKERS appear, heaving another corpse onto the cart, 
               gaping fearfully at the confusion. They scramble into their 
               seats, snap the reins. The cart rattles off as we

               EXT - STREET - DAY

               Elsewhere in Ingolstadt. Death carts and devastation. This 
               part of town was hit hard. Bodies are heaped in gutters, 
               stacked along the walls. People are huddled in doorways, 
               quaking with sickness and pestilence. CART WORKERS move among 
               them, faces shrouded with kerchiefs and burlap masks.

               WORKER #1 moves down a row of the sick and dead, shaking 
               them to see which is which, his face hidden behind heavy 
               burlap. He pauses, seeing Victor unconscious against the 
               wall, pale and covered with filth, shaking with fever. The 
               worker's eyes widen. Stunned. He calls over his shoulder:

                                     WORKER #1
                         Over here!

               WORKER #2 hurries over. Stares down. Eyes also widening.

                                     WORKER #2
                         Oh my God.

               Worker #1 rips his mask away. It's Henry. He leans down and 
               grabs Victor, trying to rouse him.

                                     HENRY
                         Victor! 

               Worker #2 also sweeps his mask aside. Professor Krempe.

                                     KREMPE
                         Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart! 
                         Lift on three! One, two, three!

               They hoist Victor off the ground by his arms and legs and 
               carry him into the street. Victor rouses, feels himself being 
               carried. He sees a death cart looming ahead, stacked with 
               heaps of reeking dead. Staring. Waiting.

                                     VICTOR
                              (delirious, struggling)
                         No... no... I'm not dead... please... 
                         Don't put me on the cart! I'm not 
                         dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD!

               ANGLE WIDENS UP as they carry him kicking and screaming past 
               the death cart and on across the square...

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               EXT - MASS CEMETERY - DAY

               A death cart rattles past, bearing its load. PAN WITH IT to 
               reveal a scene utterly Dante-esque. Here's where the dead 
               are brought to be burned en masse. Fires are burning. Smoke 
               is drifting in thick clouds, obscuring the sky. Soot is 
               drifting like black snow.  BODIES  are dumped into a slit- 
               trench, rolling and tumbling in heaps. Barrels are kicked 
               over. Streams of oil come pouring down, splashing and soaking.

               One of the corpses moves, heaving the others aside. The 
               Creature gazes around, terrified once again at the smell of 
               oil. He knows what that means. He pushes free, clambering 
               over bodies, desperately trying to scramble from the trench, 
               loose soil crumbling under his fingertips...

               ON THE LIP OF THE TRENCH

               ...as WORKERS prepare to light the blaze. A MAN turns toward 
               the trench with a burning torch... And then the Creature 
               erupts from the trench of dead bodies right before big eyes, 
               The man SCREAMS. The Creature SCREAMS even louder, cowering 
               back. The man hurls the torch. The Creature ducks as it goes 
               spinning over his head into the trench.

               WA-BOOOM! A massive wall of flame punches sky-ward. The 
               Creature whirls, stunned at the searing heat, arms thrown up 
               in horror. He flees, scattering the workers as he goes, 
               running from this ghastly place of flames and death...

               The Creature comes blundering into view. On the move. He 
               knows not where. Just away, He arrives at a pond. Water.

               He's thirsty. He scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping 
               it up with his hands. He pauses, noticing his broken 
               reflection. The water settles and his face comes clearly 
               into view. He throws his hands up and SHRIEKS, terrified at 
               his own reflection...

               ...and then he realizes it's him down there. He stirs the 
               water with his fingertips to make sure. He reaches up, 
               touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it...

               ...and utterly heartbroken. He drops his face into his hand 
               and weeps helplessly. BARKING DOGS in the distance. He looks 
               up, thinking they're after him. A moan of grief. He pushes 
               to his feet.

               TRACKING THE CREATURE  faster and faster through the trees, 
               running from this world he's been born into. Gasping for 
               breath. Crashing through branches.

               The BARKING draws closer. He hurls himself into a thicket, 
               scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves. 
               Panic. Exhaustion. Mortal terror. He flinches as something 
               comes CRASHING through the brush nearby. The legs of a DOE 
               come into view. Staggering. Falling. Thrashing down into a 
               cushion of dead leaves. Two arrows protrude from her heaving 
               side.

               A tiny FAWN stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, 
               frothing with exhaustion and terror. Waiting for his mother 
               to rise. Her thrashing grows weaker. Dying.

               The Creature moans at the sight. The fawn turns, meets his 
               gaze. An extended beat. A rush of empathy. The Creature 
               reaches out. The fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. 
               The BARKING draws closer. HUNTERS shouting. The Creature's 
               fingertips make contact with the fawn...

               A pack of the biggest, nastiest Staffordshire terriers you've 
               ever seen throw themselves HOWLING AND SNARLING onto the 
               doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, The Creature lets 
               out a SHRIEK, snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, 
               crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his 
               chest. The dogs take off after him.

               DOLLYING THE CREATURE

               Running full-tilt, SHRIEKING in terror all the way. Trying 
               to save the fawn. Trying to save himself. The dogs are 
               snapping at his heels, trying to sever his hamstrings and 
               bring him down. He hears RUSHING WATER ahead, crashes headlong 
               through a thicket...

               EXT - RIVER - DAY

               ...and sails SCREAMING into empty SPACE, twisting and spinning 
               as he falls, plummeting head-first into the rapids. The dogs 
               are left behind. The Creature gets swept along, gasping and 
               choking, caroming off huge boulders, fawn still clutched 
               protectively to his chest.

               Finally the water starts to settle. He manages to lash out 
               and secure a handhold. He pulls himself up, clambering over 
               the rocks and staggering onto firm soil. He collapses to his 
               knees, dripping water and heaving for breath. He lowers the 
               fawn away from his chest, joyous at their escape... only to 
               realize the small animal is limp and lifeless in his hands. 
               He crushed it to death trying to save it. He lays it down, 
               moaning, trying to understand. ANGLE WIDENS UP into the trees 
               as we

               WOODS - DUSK

               TILT DOWN to reveal a solitary figure in a greatcoat trudging 
               across the sodden countryside under a dismal, darkening sky. 
               Cold. Hungry. Wet. Tired.

               The Creature pauses, hearing FAINT MUSIC drifting on the 
               breeze: the lovely flute-like sounds of a recorder. He slogs 
               to the crest of a ridge. There's a small house in the valley 
               below. A peasant dwelling. Smoke drifts from the chimney. 
               That's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive 
               rendition of our movie's WALTZ/LOVE THEME).

               The Creature proceeds down the ridge... drawn by the music 
               and the promise of warmth.

               HOUSE - DAY

               The Creature approaches cautiously. Furtive. He eases to a 
               window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back. Listening. The 
               tune ends. We hear the pleasant murmur of VOICES. FOOTSTEPS 
               come clumping across the floor. The Creature reels back and 
               dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and 
               swings open. FELIX exits, a poor man trying to scratch an 
               honest living from the soil. He heads in the same direction 
               as the Creature...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               ...and walks around the corner of the house just as the 
               Creature scrambles from view behind the chicken coops. The 
               Creature watches through the wire and wood as Felix approaches 
               and stops, only his legs visible. Feed is scattered through 
               the wire. The chickens begins to eat. The Creature backs up

               PIGSTY - DUSK

               ...and finds himself in the company of PIGS. The animals 
               GRUNT and SQUEAL in alarm.

                                     FELIX (O.S.)
                         Yes, yes, I'm coming...

               The Creature scurries further back into the shadows as Felix's 
               feet stop just outside. A pail is upended. Slop pours into 
               the trough. Felix walks away. The pigs scurry to eat. The 
               Creature leans forward intently. Food?

               He crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. They 
               jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. 
               He laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his 
               chin. Not much on taste, but it's edible.

               He stops, hearing the recorder MUSIC again, turning toward 
               the sound. He follows it, crawling back into the darkest 
               recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house. He 
               places his eye to a chink between the logs...

               ...and sees GRANDFATHER playing the instrument near a 
               fireplace of glowing embers. The Creature shifts for another 
               view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner. Felix 
               and his wife MARIE are helped by their children, MAGGIE AND 
               THOMAS, ages 6 and 8

                                     MARIE
                         Bring Grandfather to the table.

               The old man stops playing as the children scurry over. As 
               Maggie helps him to his feet, Thomas tosses another log on 
               the fire. It BLAZES UP. Fire and sparks. In the pigsty, the 
               Creature draws back with a fearful moan...

               ...that nobody but GRANDFATHER hears, He pauses to gaze 
               blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering 
               what it might have been. Probably nothing. He lets the 
               children lead him toward the table. The meal is brought from 
               the stove and ladled out.

               The Creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling 
               it from here. A string of drool spills from his mouth. It's 
               humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast 
               compared to pig slop...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Victor lies sleeping. Wrestling with troubled dreams. In an 
               eerie echo of before: the door creaks open in a spill of 
               light. A shadow enters, creeps to the bed, falls across his 
               face. Victor's eyes fly open. He tries to erupt from bed, 
               choking on a scream... and Henry wrestles him back to the 
               pillow to feel his clammy forehead.

                                     HENRY
                         Thank God your fever broke.
                              (offers him water)
                         Slowly, now. Just a sip.
                              (Victor sips, falls 
                              back)
                         I've been worried we might lose you. 
                         It's been touch-and-go for a week.

                                     VICTOR
                         A... week?

                                     HENRY
                         We feared cholera. Turned out to be 
                         pneumonia, brought on by nervous 
                         exhaustion and some idiot running 
                         around in a storm.

                                     VICTOR
                         Is that your diagnosis?

                                     HENRY
                         Mine and Professor Krempe's.
                              (off his look)
                         We've been trading off nursing you 
                         in shifts. The rest of the time we're 
                         out working with the cholera victims. 
                         It's his turn for that just now.

                                     VICTOR
                         You've been going round-the-clock?

                                     HENRY
                         We catch a few hours sleep where we 
                         can. Usually here at your bedside.

                                     VICTOR
                              (deeply moved)
                         Everything in moderation, Clerval.

                                     HENRY
                         Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.

               Victor takes Henry's hand. Squeezes it.

                                     HENRY
                         It's the down-and-outs I pity most. 
                         Those who can't fend for themselves. 
                         They'll be dead by the thousands 
                         before this is done. They don't stand 
                         a chance out there.

                                     VICTOR
                              (thinking of his 
                              creation)
                         No. They don't.

                                     HENRY
                         Victor. This place looked like a 
                         charnel house. What went on here?

               Victor pauses, too emotional to respond. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         I want to go home.

               Beat.

               Henry accepts this, though he doesn't like it.

                                     HENRY
                         It'll be months before you're well 
                         enough. Meantime, your family must 
                         be frantic not hearing from you.

               Henry grabs a stack of letters from the nightstand.

                                     HENRY
                         I found these. Some of the postmarks 
                         go back nine months.
                              (slaps them on the 
                              bed)
                         Why don't you open them? And when 
                         you've the strength, have the decency 
                         to ease their minds with a reply. 
                         Soon as the city ends quarantine, 
                         I'll even mail it for you. Along 
                         with this.
                              (raises the locket)
                         It's a beautiful gift. Does her no 
                         good lying here.

               Henry leaves him alone to wrestle with his guilt. Victor is 
               swept with emotion and remorse. He closes his eyes. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It can't survive.

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               The Creature and the pigs are sleeping in a heap. He rouses, 
               scattering them, crawls to the slats of the sty. Felix is 
               returning wearily from the fields with a large basket on his 
               back. The Creature moves to his chink in the wall to see 
               Felix enter the house and dump the basket out for Marie. A 
               pathetic array of potatoes and turnips.

                                     FELIX
                         Not much to look at. Even less to 
                         eat. I don't how we're going to get 
                         through the winter with this yield.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll sell another pig at market.

                                     FELIX
                         One less for us.

                                     MARIE
                         We'll make do. We always have.

               He sinks into a chair, weighed by worry. She moves to comfort 
               him, cradling his head to her breast. He returns her embrace, 
               drawing strength. A tender, gentle moment. The Creature 
               watches, puzzled and empathetic, deeply moved by her sympathy. 
               Felix gathers himself, wipes his eyes.

                                     FELIX
                         I'll see if I can scratch a few more 
                         out of the ground.

               He hoists the basket and exits. The Creature turns to watch 
               Felix trudging back toward the fields.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               Felix digs for potatoes, tilling as he goes. Back-breaking 
               work. Thomas provides what help he can. Some distance away, 
               Maggie and Grandfather are tending the cow. ANGLE SHIFTS to 
               reveal the Creature watching from the brambles...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family eat their dinner. Potatoes 
               and turnips. A glimmer of understanding in his eyes.

               EXT - HOUSE - NIGHT

               A long shadow looms toward the dwelling... circling the 
               house... approaching the shed. Baskets and tools...

               EXT - FIELDS - NIGHT

               We find the Creature working by the light of a refulgent 
               moon, hacking away at the soil, tilling the earth...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAWN

               The Creature stirs, hearing movement within the house. He 
               scurries to the slats of the sty and peers out. All the 
               baskets from the tool shed are stacked to overflow before 
               the door.

               The door opens. Felix steps out and trips on a basket, 
               sprawling to the ground in a torrent of potatoes and turnips. 
               He sits up, gazing in wonder.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               A sliver of warm light spills through the chink in the wall.

               The Creature looms into frame, busily munching a raw potato.

               A pig comes snuffling at his elbow. He shoves him away. Go 
               find your own. Inside, the family is enjoying a much more 
               generous meal than the last one:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I wish we could thank our benefactor.

                                     FELIX
                         Nothing in this life comes free of 
                         cost. I'd like to know who and why.

                                     MAGGIE
                         It's the Good Spirit of the forest.

                                     FELIX
                         Who's been filling your head?

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         It does no harm.

                                     FELIX
                              (peers at him)
                         Oh, I see.

                                     THOMAS
                         Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?

               Felix and Marie exchange a look. He's not as amused as she 
               is, but lets it go. She smiles at the children.

                                     MARIE
                         Of course it is. Now finish your 
                         food before it gets cold.

               EXT - POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. The cow is grazing at 
               a distance. The Creature creeps into view, listening to the 
               music. Grandfather senses his presence. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Who's there? Felix? Children?

               No response. He turns back. Unsettled. Continues playing.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches Marie instructing the children in their 
               letters. A half dozen words are written in chalk on a slate 
               board. Maggie is trying to puzzle one out:

                                     MAGGIE
                         ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.

                                     MARIE
                         Good! And now the next

                                     CREATURE
                              (mimicking the effort)
                         ...freh...nnn..nd. Freehhnnnd.

               He's delighted to have uttered his first word.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               Felix is chopping lengths of wood, dulled by the task. The 
               children are stacking the wood on a litter.

               EXT - FIELD - DUSK

               Felix and the children walk home. The litter of wood is being 
               dragged by their cow...

               EXT - HOUSE - DUSK

               Felix stacks the last pile of wood under the eaves. Marie 
               meets him at the door, takes his hands.

                                     MARIE
                         Your hands are bleeding again. Come 
                         in. I'll rub liniment.

               They go inside. The door closes. CAMERA PUSHES to the pigsty. 
               Eyes peering out.

               EXT - WOODS - NIGHT

               The Creature walks along, munching a turnip, axe slung over 
               his shoulder, muttering:

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The walls around the house are stacked impossibly high with 
               cords of wood. Felix and Marie gaze out the door. Stunned.

                                     FELIX
                         What is going on here?

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - NIGHT

               Snow is drifting outside the tall dormer window. We find 
               Victor at his desk, reading a letter:

                                     VICTOR
                         "...but it's been so long since I've 
                         heard from you. Remember the vow we 
                         took the night you left? You must be 
                         honest with me if your feelings have 
                         changed. Answer for the sake of our 
                         friendship, and both our future 
                         happiness."
                              (pause)
                         She wrote that four months ago.

               ANGLE SHIFTS to include Henry. He's been listening.

                                     HENRY
                         A woman like that is far too rare to 
                         be taken lightly.

               Victor ponders the letter. He lays it next to the locket, 
               pulls out a sheet of paper and quill, begins to write...

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature observes another lesson. Six more words are 
               chalked on the board. Thomas is struggling with the first:

                                     THOMAS
                         Ch...uur-ch. Church.

                                     CREATURE
                         Ch...uuu...ch.

                                     MARIE
                         Good. And the next.

                                     THOMAS
                         Fl...oww.

                                     CREATURE
                         Floww...

               And then, amazingly, the Creature finishes the word before 
               Thomas does:

                                     CREATURE
                         ...wwer. Flower.

                                     THOMAS
                         ...wer. Flower?

                                     MARIE
                         Very good! Maggie. Try the next.

               Now the Creature beats Maggie to the punch:

                                     CREATURE
                         Garrr...denn. Garden.

                                     THOMAS
                         Maria! Look! It's snowing!

               The children crowd to the window. The Creature turns, peering 
               through the slats. White flakes drift magically down. The 
               door flies open, the children pour out. The adults appear in 
               the doorway:

                                     MARIE
                         Maggie! Thomas! You'll catch your 
                         death!

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Let them play. There's plenty of 
                         wood for the fire.

                                     FELIX
                              (shoots her a look)
                         He's right about that.

               Before she can react, he grabs her by the waist and drags 
               her shrieking out into the snow. Before you know it, a wild 
               snowball fight ensues. Screams and laughter.

               THE CREATURE watches his family cavorting in the snow, having 
               the time of their lives. His face lights up with a smile. 
               Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         It's snnowwinng.

               EXT - HOUSE - DAY

               Bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. Felix 
               and the children are heading out, spirits high. Felix has 
               his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               TRACKING Felix and the children. They're laughing and joking, 
               the kids playful and giggling. The Creature shadows them, 
               looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. 
               Happy as a kid himself.

               Maggie and Thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing 
               their arms and legs in the snow. They jump to their feet and 
               hurry to catch up with Felix. The Creature peers out, amazed 
               to see two snow-angels in the powder at his feet. Up ahead, 
               Maggie points to a 6-foot fir tree.

                                     MAGGIE
                         That one! It's the most beautiful 
                         tree I've ever seen!

               Felix shrugs off his coil of rope and starts chopping.

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature gazes through the chink in the wall, face lit 
               up with wonder. Inside, the tree is a dazzling vision of 
               ornaments and light. The house is filled with joy and 
               laughter. Grandfather plays his recorder by a roaring fire

                                     CREATURE
                         Most beautiful... tree...

               The kids go dashing across the room. The Creature shifts to 
               the slats as the door opens, throwing a spill of warm light.

               The children set something out in the snow. Maggie calls out 
               into the darkness:

                                     MAGGIE
                         Merry Christmas!

               The door closes. The Creature creeps from his sty, scurries 
               closer to investigate. He finds a covered plate topped with 
               a glittering red silk flower as decoration. The slate board 
               is jammed in the snow. On it is chalked a child's rendering 
               of a glowing angel and a message:

                                     CREATURE
                         For the... Goood Spirr-rit... of 
                         the... Forr-rest.

               He snatches up the plate, scurries around the side of the 
               house, and hunkers down near the tool shed with his prize.

               He plucks the red silk flower, enchanted by it, tucks it 
               gingerly into an inner coat pocket. He uncovers the plate to 
               reveal a wonderful array of Christmas cookies.

               He's not sure what they are, but they don't smell half bad.

               He picks one up and bites into it. He pauses, stunned, eyes 
               going wide as saucers. A whine builds in his throat. He starts 
               huffing air as he chews, mouth gaping, mind thoroughly blown. 
               Screw potatoes and turnips.

               EXT - HOUSE - MORNING

               The children race out the door to find the plate empty. And 
               a big snow-angel waiting for them in the yard,

               INT - PIGSTY - NIGHT

               The Creature watches the family clustered around the fire. 
               Marie reads a book aloud:

                                     MARIE
                         ...with particles of heavenly fire, 
                         the God of Nature did his soul 
                         inspire... and pliant still the 
                         ethereal energy which wise Prometheus 
                         tempered into paste...

               The Creature leans back into the shadows, grappling with the 
               concept of book. He reaches into the pocket of the greatcoat, 
               and pulls out what's been there all along:

               Victor's Journal. So that's what this is. A book. He unwinds 
               the thong, riffles the pages. Letters fall, scattering from 
               the pages. He picks one up by the corner, turns his head 
               this way and that. Slowly:

                                     CREATURE

               EXT - GRANDFATHER'S POND - DAY

               Grandfather sits playing his recorder. Again, the Creature 
               approaches to listen. Grandfather stops. Turns.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I know you're there.
                              (waits for a response)
                         Won't you speak to me?

               The Creature studies Grandfather for a time. The old man 
               waits. Finally starts to play again. The Creature finds a 
               spot to listen. He opens Victor's journal.

               CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN as he puzzles over it...

               INT - PIGSTY - DAY

               ...and we CONTINUE PUSHING SLOWLY IN as the Creature reads:

                         bodieess I have... gatherrred...

               He turns the page and discovers his own rough likeness: it's 
               Victor's sketch of his patchwork man. The rendering includes 
               suture marks where the pieces were joined.

               The Creature gazes for a long time. His finger traces the 
               penciled suture-line where an arm joins the torso. Eyes going 
               wider. Revelation slowly dawning. No. It can't be. it's too 
               horrible to conceive...

               ...and he drops the journal, clawing at his coat in a surge 
               of panic, wrenching it away to reveal his arm... And the 
               massive suture scars joining his shoulder to his torso in an 
               exact match to the drawing. He throws his head back in an 
               animalistic PRIMAL SCREAM, face twisted in a mask of utter 
               horror, Munch's painting made flesh...

               IN THE WOODS

               ...and his scream echoes across the countryside, Felix turns 
               from chopping wood. His family gathers, eyes wide, listening 
               to the sound trail off. Softly:

                                     FELIX
                         God in heaven.

               A massive hand rips the page from the journal, raises it in 
               a clenched fist.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature huddled in a corner, 
               dropping his head into his arms to hide his face. Sunlight 
               throws streaks of light and shadow through the slats. He 
               sobs, wracked with despair as we

               The house is distant below. Felix and his family are heading 
               out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow 
               before them. Only Grandfather is missing.

               The gentle MUSIC of the recorder drifts up from the house.

               ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature hunkered on a hill. 
               Watching. Waiting. The family dwindles in the distance.

               INT - HOUSE - DAY

               For the first time, we actually see the inside of the house 
               from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall.

               Grandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder.

               The Creature's face appears at a window. Peering in. He ducks 
               from view, appearing at another window. Making sure the house 
               is otherwise empty. He vanishes again. The door swings 
               silently open. His figure fills the doorway.

               Grandfather stops playing. Silence.

                         Would you like to sit by the fire?

               The Creature enters. Sits. Holds his hands toward the embers, 
               feeling the warmth.

                         The music? Or the fire?

               Grandfather offers him the recorder. The Creature hesitates, 
               takes it, inept where such delicacy is required. He puts it 
               to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones. He gives 
               it back, huffing air, delighted.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I'm glad you finally came to the 
                         door. A man shouldn't have to scurry 
                         in the shadows.

                                     CREATURE
                         Better that way... for me.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why?

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm... very, very ugly. People are 
                         afraid. Except you.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (smiles)
                         It can't be as bad as that.

                                     CREATURE
                              (soft)
                         Worse.

               The old man-reaches for his face. The Creature draws back.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         I can see you with my hands. If you'll 
                         trust me.

               The Creature decides to trust. He eases forward. Grandfather 
               runs his fingers over his features. Gently:

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         You're an outcast.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. I have been seeking my friends.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Friends? Do they live around here?

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes. Very close

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Why do you not go to them?

               The Creature pauses. Emotions swirling. Afraid to continue.

                                     CREATURE
                         I have been... afraid. Afraid... 
                         they will hate me... because I am so 
                         very ugly... and they are so very 
                         beautiful

                                     GRANDFATHER
                              (softly)
                         People can be kinder than you think.

                                     CREATURE
                         I am afraid.

               Grandfather reaches out and takes the Creature's hands.

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Perhaps I can help. Tell me who.

               The Creature is huffing air, breath hitching in his chest 
               like a panicking child. His monstrous eyes well up with tears. 
               Trying to get the words out:

                                     CREATURE
                         I love them... so very much. I want... 
                         I want... them to be my ff-family. I 
                         II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm-
                         mmuch...

               The Creature pauses. Trying to get the words out. And the 
               door swings open. The Creature whips his head. There stands 
               Maggie. Eyes going wide. Breath catching in her throat. She 
               lets out an ear-splitting SHRIEK! The Creature throws himself 
               on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't let them hate me!

               Felix bursts in, shoving Maggie aside, hell breaking loose 
               in screaming, hollering chaos: Marie trying to get the 
               children out of the way, Felix throwing himself on the 
               Creature to rip him off the old man, the Creature sprawling 
               to the floor, the old man shouting, the children SHRIEKING, 
               Felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, 
               again and again, trying to kill the thing...

                                     GRANDFATHER
                         Leave him alone!

               ...the CREATURE SCREAMING and taking the blows, writhing 
               across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his 
               pleading hands. The CREATURE rolls from under the brutal 
               beating and sails out the door.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               The Creature runs bleeding and sobbing, a specter sailing 
               among the trees with greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings. 
               Running from the horrified screams of rejection still echoing 
               in his mind.

               EXT - WOODS - DAY

               A snowscape. Stark trees. A figure in a greatcoat. Head bowed 
               with misery. Leaning against a tree. Trying to catch his 
               breath. Can't. Crying too hard. He sinks to his knees, hands 
               clutched bitterly to his heaving chest. Wondering why the 
               anguish doesn't stop his heart in mid-beat.

               A realization. He pulls the little red silk flower from the 
               inside pocket. It lies glittering in his huge, misshapen 
               palm like gentle magic. Or hope. Yes.

               HOUSE - DUSK

               The sky is brewing. The Creature runs across the courtyard 
               toward the house, breathless, holding his palm out. See? 
               Here's the flower you gave me. Don't you understand?

                                     CREATURE
                         It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee!

               Nothing. He glances around. The pigs are gone. Chickens too.

               The Creature's eyes go wide. He dashes to the house

               HOUSE - DUSK

               ...and bursts in to find it empty. Items have been scattered 
               and left behind. Books, clothes, even the old man's recorder. 
               They left in a hurry.

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no.

               HOUSE - NIGHT

               We hear furniture CRASHING, glass SHATTERING, shelves being 
               ripped from walls. A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. 
               The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. 
               He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a 
               satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's 
               recorder jammed in his belt.

               A HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning 
               the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along 
               with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting 
               as the house is consumed...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               Massive pale gray feet walking through the snow. ANGLE 
               WIDENING to reveal a lone, windswept figure traversing the 
               glacier with a walking staff. Struggling toward the crest of 
               a ridge. Greatcoat billowing in a freezing wind.

               THE CREATURE rises from below the crest and gazes down.

               Glowering with triumph at achieving his goal. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Geneva.

               AERIAL SHOT sweeps up the slope of the glacier like the wind 
               itself, rising magnificently past the tiny figure standing 
               on the ridge, sailing up over the crest... to reveal the 
               valley and lake of Geneva below.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - VICTOR'S GARRET - DAY (SPRING)

               Sunlight streams through the dormer window. Birds twitter on 
               the ledge outside. The trees are in bloom. Victor stands 
               dressed and ready to go, taking one last pensive look around 
               at the now-empty garret. Henry appears:

                                     HENRY
                         Our carriage is here.

               EXT - INGOLSTADT CITY GATES - DAY

               Bustling with activity. Hopeful. A traffic snarl is jammed 
               up in both directions, waiting to get in and out of the city. 
               People, carriages, wagons, goods. We find Professor and MRS. 
               KREMPE saying goodbye to Victor and Henry:

                                     MRS. KREMPE
                              (watching the gates)
                         Such a terrible winter. I'll praise 
                         God to see those gates open again.

                                     KREMPE
                         I'll have all your things sent on. 
                         They should arrive soon after.
                              (Victor nods)
                         It's been a rough time, lad. For us 
                         all. But if you'd like to come back 
                         and finish out your final term once 
                         university re-opens...

               A ROAR goes up from the crowd. The gates are finally opening 
               as SOLDIERS swing them aside. The traffic starts to flow.

               Victor turns back to Krempe, nods gratefully.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Professor. For everything.

               Krempe is flustered as Victor gives him an awkward hug.

                                     KREMPE
                         Write and let us know you've arrived 
                         safely.

               Victor breaks the embrace. He and Henry clamber into the 
               carriage. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Take me home, my friend.

               Henry signals the DRIVER. The reins snap. The carriage lurches 
               away, easing into the flow of traffic as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               William, now 10, comes charging up the steps with a small 
               package under his arm, nearly bowling over Mrs. Moritz as he 
               sails past her hollering his head off:

                                     WILLIAM
                         HE'S COMING HOME!

               INT - PARLOR - DAY

               Willie careens into the parlor, where Elizabeth and Justine 
               are entertaining FRIENDS.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth! Justine!

               Father enters, trailed by HOUSEHOLD STAFF.

                                     FATHER
                         What's all the fuss? Why are you 
                         shouting?

                                     WILLIAM
                         He's coming home! Tonight!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Who? Victor?

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's what I'm telling you!

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (swept with relief)
                         Thank God.

               Willie thrusts the package into her hands. She hesitates

                                     FATHER
                         Open it.

               Willie scrambles to bring her the letter opener. Elizabeth 
               lays the package down, slits it open. Willie peers in.

               Elizabeth pulls the locket out to the admiration of all. She 
               presses the catch. The locket pops open to reveal Waldman's 
               miniature oil painting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's Victor!

                                     JUSTINE
                         It's beautiful! May I?
                              (takes the locket)
                         He looks so handsome.

               Elizabeth pulls out the letter. Apprehension and hope. She 
               begins to read. The others watch her. Waiting. Her face lights 
               up, blinking back tears. She remembers to breathe.

                                     FATHER
                         What does it say?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Let this locket be a token of the 
                         vow we took the night I left.
                              (beat)
                         He's coming home to marry me.

               Instant pandemonium and joy... except from Justine, whose 
               heart quietly breaks. Father and the others ROAR with approval 
               while Willie jumps and shouts:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Married! The two of you?

                                     FATHER
                         Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you 
                         were children!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (softly)
                         That's wonderful.

               She hands the locket back. She slips quietly from the room, 
               unnoticed by the others...

               INT - ENTRYWAY - DAY

               and hurries down the hall, fighting back tears.

               RESUME PARLOR as Elizabeth is swept up in congratulatory 
               conversation. Willie grabs the locket, admiring it:

                                     WILLIAM
                         Elizabeth? Can I take this to show 
                         Peter?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Willie, it's not a toy for your 
                         friends.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'll take extra special care, I 
                         promise! Pete's never seen what Victor 
                         looks like! He'll admire it 
                         enormously!

               Willie's so solemn and earnest that Elizabeth has to smile.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Don't dawdle. It'll be dark in a few 
                         hours.

               The boy takes off like a shot. Father throws his arm around

               Elizabeth, announcing to all:

                                     FATHER
                         Join us for champagne! My son is 
                         coming home!

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - LATE DAY

               Geese scatter as Willie comes racing across the grounds. He 
               clambers over a low fence, heading into the miles of wooded 
               acreage behind the house. His favorite shortcut.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - LATE DAY

               Willie hurries/dawdles along as kids do, the precious locket 
               clutched in his hands, admiring it. He can't get over the 
               fact that his brother's finally coming home.

               He pauses, hearing FAINT TONES carried on the breeze, eerie 
               and flute-like. A recorder. Curious, he follows the sounds 
               further and further into the woods...

               EXT - POND - LATE DAY

               ...and comes into view of the pond. There's a FIGURE sitting 
               half-concealed among the tall reeds, gazing off across the 
               water and playing his delicate wind instrument with oddly-
               pleasing dissonance (again, a simple variation of our familiar 
               WALTZ/LOVE THEME.)

               Willie draws closer. Curious. Not wanting to intrude, but 
               listening to the music. The figure in the reeds still hasn't 
               noticed him...

               ...And then his head abruptly whips around, An ogre right 
               out of a storybook. Willie's eyes go wide. The locket drops 
               from his fingers into the dust. The boy turns and runs as 
               the monster in the reeds lunges to its feet:

                                     CREATURE
                         Wait! Don't be afraid!

               The boy keeps running. The Creature comes shambling up from 
               the pond, still calling after him. He picks up the dropped 
               object. As he rises, he finds himself staring at the locket.

               At the small painting it contains. Victor Frankenstein. He 
               raises his gaze after the fleeing boy. Maybe Willie does 
               have reason to be afraid.

               The Creature starts after him, locket clenched in his fist, 
               teeth grinding in greater and greater rage. Eyes wild.

               THEIR FEET go pounding through the brambles and brush. The 
               terrified boy. The pursuing monster. Faster and faster...

               INT - FRANKENSTEIN KITCHEN - DUSK

               Whirling with activity. Mrs. Moritz supervises the staff.

               Elizabeth and Justine are helping with the preparations.

               Justine turns with a platter, collides with one of the kitchen 
               staff. Carrots go flying.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Justine! Pay attention!

                                     JUSTINE
                              (tight)
                         Yes, Mother.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (pulls her aside)
                         Are you all right?

                                     JUSTINE
                              (even tighter)
                         Fine.

               Justine sees genuine concern. She softens:

                                     JUSTINE
                         I'll be all right. Really.

               Father enters with Claude. Both men worried.

                                     FATHER
                         Have you seen Willie?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is he not back yet?

                                     FATHER
                         Claude rode over there to see if 
                         held lost track of time. They say he 
                         never arrived.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It's far too late for him to still 
                         be out.

               EXT - MANSION - DUSK

               Elizabeth exits with the others

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find 
                         him.

               He rushes to gather the men. Elizabeth gazes off. Wind kicking 
               up. Night approaching. Almost too dark to see.

               EXT - COUNTRYSIDE/WOODS - NIGHT

               A massive search in progress. People are scouring the fields 
               on horse and on foot, shouting Willie's name. Elizabeth enters 
               frame, calling out:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         WILLIE!

               LIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching.

               EXT - WOODED AREA - NIGHT

               The stark black silhouettes of tree trunks bisect the frame 
               in foreground as Justine approaches from the fields, lantern 
               held high...

                                     JUSTINE
                         WILLIE!

               ...and one of the "tree trunks" turns out not to be. It darts 
               abruptly across frame with a billow of flapping greatcoat, 
               Justine enters the woods. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING sends shadows 
               skittering among the trees...

               EXT - ROAD TO MANSION - NIGHT

               ...And the storm is now a raging downpour, TILT DOWN to reveal 
               a coach clattering through the rain.

               INT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor is peering out the window flap.

                                     VICTOR
                         There! Look!

               Henry cranes to look. A LIGHTNING FLASH stutters the mansion 
               briefly to life a few hundred yards down the road,

                                     HENRY
                         Quite a place.

                                     VICTOR
                         Thank you, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         For what?

                                     VICTOR
                         This. My home. My family.
                              (softly)
                         If not for you, I'd be dead in a 
                         burial pit somewhere.

               Henry smiles, squeezes his shoulder. The carriage lurches 
               violently, tossing them forward.

               EXT - COACH - NIGHT

               Victor jumps from the coach as the DRIVER wrestles his rearing 
               horses under control and points. Victor turns.

               Elizabeth stands in the downpour like a ghost. Drenched to 
               the bone. Weeping from the depths of her soul. Holding Willie 
               in her arms. The boy's arms hang limp, his head dangles back. 
               Victor starts forward, stunned, unable to comprehend, running 
               faster and faster...

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth?

               ...and now others are converging on the scene, dark screaming 
               figures in the storm. Victor reaches her first as the others 
               crowd around in a panic of confusion, crushing and jostling 
               as she collapses into Victor's arms, all of them cradling 
               Willie, and then Father is there, shoving his way through, -- 
               seeing his dead boy and collapsing in the muck with a SCREAM, 
               and suddenly Henry is there shouting for the men to lift him 
               and everybody is scrambling and screaming as we

               INT - MANSION - FATHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Silence. All we hear now is the SOFT TICKING of a clock.

               Henry tenderly ministers to Father, who lies gravely ill.

               INT - PARLOR - MORNING

               Elizabeth is sitting. Elbows crossed. Holding herself 
               together. Face ashen. Dazed. Still in shock. Mrs. Moritz is 
               nearby, looking much the same. Eyes swimming with tears.

                                     MRS. MORITZ
                         Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         We'll organize another search now 
                         that it's light enough. We'll find 
                         her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.

               Henry comes downstairs. He and Victor confer in whispers 
               then approach Elizabeth. Victor crouches before her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What is Father's outlook?

                                     HENRY
                         I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet 
                         and proper care he may eventually 
                         regain some or most of his strength.

               Victor squeezes her hand. Comfort and strength.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Thank you, Henry.

               There's a KNOCKING at the front door.

               INT - ENTRYWAY - MORNING

               Victor opens the door. POLICEMEN hover outside. Faces grim.

                                     POLICEMAN #1
                         Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended 
                         the murderer. Not five miles from 
                         here, hiding in a barn.

                                     VICTOR
                         Who is it?

               The policemen trade uneasy glances.

                                     POLICEMAN #2
                         It's very unsettling, sir. And quite 
                         strange. Perhaps you'd better come 
                         with us.

               INT - JAIL CELL - DAY

               Victor is led in by policemen. The JAILER unlocks the cell.

               Victor enters as the men depart. Victor is alone, staring at 
               a FIGURE huddled in the corner, pooled in shadow. We get the 
               impression of long, dangling hair. The figure stirs...

                                     FEMALE VOICE
                         Victor?

               ...and leans into the light. Justine. Pale. Dazed. Scared

                                     JUSTINE
                         Victor! It's you! Thank God!

               She rushes to him, throws herself into his arms. He reacts 
               stiffly, not at all sure he wants her touching him.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Is it true? What they say about 
                         Willie? Is it true?

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes.

               She dissolves into tears. Barely able to breathe.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Willie. My poor little angel.
                              (looks up)
                         Victor! They think I did it!

                                     VICTOR
                         Did you?

               Justine pauses. Stunned. Her eyes on his. Here's the deepest 
               betrayal ever experienced. Her heart turns to ash.

                                     JUSTINE
                              (low)
                         I don't believe... I am in need of 
                         your comfort... anymore.

                                     VICTOR
                              (a whisper)
                         Did you, Justine?

               Beat. She hauls off and slaps him hard enough to rock his 
               head around. Then she slaps him again. Harder.

                                     JUSTINE
                         Get out!

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               The courtroom is packed. Justine sits accused. An older 
               KITCHEN MAID is on the stand.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         I found her sobbing her eyes out. 
                         Poor thing, I said, what's all this? 
                         And she spilled her heart to me about 
                         Master Victor. How she'd always loved 
                         him, and now he was coming home to 
                         marry mistress Elizabeth.

               A MURMUR sweeps the courtroom. Victor and Elizabeth share a 
               stunned glance.

                                     KITCHEN MAID
                         She cried and cried about the 
                         beautiful locket he'd sent. How she 
                         wished it was hers. She swore me 
                         never to tell a soul.
                              (peers at Justine)
                         That was before the boy went missing, 
                         a'course.

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               Victor is on the stand:

                                     VICTOR
                         I always viewed her with brotherly 
                         affection. I had no idea of her 
                         feelings for me.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Rejection can be a powerful wound. 
                         People have been known to do uncanny 
                         things.

                                     VICTOR
                         But to commit so ghastly and terrible 
                         a crime against a child she loved?

               Victor pauses, gnawed by some vague intuition. He looks to 
               Justine. She gazes back, her feelings hidden. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         It's hard to believe.

               INT - COURTROOM - DAY

               Elizabeth is on the stand:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Justine and I grew up as sisters. I 
                         know her better than anybody.

                         Do you think it possible she committed 
                         this crime?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         William was as much her child as 
                         mine. We were both mother to him.
                              (beat)
                         I believe she would sooner have 
                         strangled the life from her own body.

                         Then you consider the charge without 
                         merit.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I consider the charge imbecilic.

               INT - COURT ROOM - DAY

               Justine is now on the stand:

                                     JUSTINE
                         Yes. I took refuge in the barn. 
                         Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? 
                         Freezing and wet? I was exhausted 
                         and could search no longer.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         And is it true, Miss Moritz, that 
                         you love Victor Frankenstein? That 
                         your heart was broken?
                              (off her silence)
                         Answer the question. Do you love 
                         Victor Frankenstein?

               Her gaze wanders to Victor, eyes locking on his. Stares back, 
               trapped.

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have always loved him.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         Is it also not true that you murdered 
                         his brother William in a misdirected 
                         crime of passion?

                                     JUSTINE
                         Murder Willie? In my heart, he was 
                         our child. Victor's and mine. Such a 
                         thing could never have entered my 
                         mind.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         So you have claimed. Yet you have no 
                         explanation for this.
                              (holds up the locket)
                         The locket last seen in the hands of 
                         the poor murdered child was found 
                         hidden in your dress the morning 
                         following the murder. The locket you 
                         so coveted.
                              (leans close)
                         How did it come to be in your 
                         possession?

                                     JUSTINE
                         I have no knowledge of that.

               EXT - FIELD - DAY

               A PAIR OF FEET drop heavily in frame. THUMP-CRACK! A shoe 
               flies off. The CROWD gasps. Mrs. Moritz collapses WAILING to 
               the ground. Elizabeth drops to her side to comfort her. Victor 
               just stands staring. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal Justine dangling 
               from the noose, neck broken, hands bound and feet still 
               twitching.

               EXT - SAME FIELD - NIGHT

               Another eerie echo of before: a storm is raging. The body 
               dangles from the scaffold, lashed by wind and rain. Victor 
               looms from the darkness, staring.

               And then a massive white hand thrusts into frame and grabs 
               his shoulder. Victor whirls and finds himself staring up 
               into the last face he ever expected to see again, the hideous 
               necrotic features bathed in a purple/white GLARE OF LIGHTNING. 
               He SCREAMS as the Creature lashes out, grabs him by the coat, 
               draws him breathlessly closer, inch by inch, eyeball-to-
               eyeball, grinning his awful rictus grin. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Frankenstein.

               Victor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his 
               arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look 
               there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating 
               Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity... and then 
               the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness.  
               Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, 
               gazing at the scaffold, horrified.

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!

               Screaming now, rushing to the scaffold, throwing his arms 
               around the innocent girl dangling there, sliding down, sinking 
               to his knees, weeping helplessly:

                                     VICTOR
                         Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.

               INT - MANSION - STUDY - DAWN

               Victor pulls a carved box from a shelf. Opens it. Lying inside 
               in their velvet cradle are a gorgeous pair of Model 1820 
               Collier flintlock revolvers.

               MANSION - DAWN

               Victor is bundled in a rough coat, packing final supplies on 
               a horse held by Claude. Elizabeth is at his heels.

                                     VICTOR
                         My mind was not playing tricks. He 
                         was there in the storm... gloating 
                         over his crimes... challenging me to 
                         come.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         But why risk yourself? Hasn't this 
                         family suffered enough?

                                     VICTOR
                         I've no choice

                                     ELIZABETH
                         If what you say is true, it is a 
                         matter for the police!

                                     VICTOR
                         They've done a fine job. Hanging an 
                         innocent for the crime of a fiend.

               He rams the rifle into its scabbard, turns to her.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (softly)
                         Do you know this man? Is there 
                         something between you?

                                     VICTOR
                         I know only that he is a killer.  
                         And I shall bring back his carcass.

               Victor heaves himself into the saddle and rides off. TILT UP 
               to the mountain. Shrouded in snow. Waiting.

               MONT BLANC - DAY

               A lone horse and rider appear, on his mission of revenge...

               Victor ascends the mountain. The mountain is brutal and 
               unforgiving. Victor dismounts, leading his horse onto the 
               glacier. A bitter wind blows...

               They plod on. Searching. Magnificent rugged vistas unfolding 
               before our eyes. Primeval and vast...

               The horse suddenly spooks. Victor calms him. Staring. Is 
               that a figure down there? He shades his eyes against the 
               cutting sleet. Somebody in the distance. Down there on the 
               snow field. A tiny speck. Watching him.

               The figure starts running, leaping across the ice with great 
               bounds. Right toward Victor. Victor wrenches the carved box 
               from the saddle bag. The horse bolts. Victor drops to the 
               snow, throws open the box, frantically snatches up the pair 
               of revolvers.

               He glances up. The figure is gone, vanished in drifts of 
               white. Victor rises with a revolver in each hand, cocks the 
               flintlocks of both, turning slowly around. Gazing at the 
               rocks and crags. Searching.

                                     VICTOR
                         WHERE ARE YOU?

               He hears nothing but his own voice echoing back... and then 
               FEET CRUNCHING through the snow. He turns. The Creature is 
               running toward him across the glacier with inhuman speed, 
               greatcoat billowing like huge dark wings.

               Victor raises the first pistol. Hesitates. As frightened and 
               angry as he is, a small part of him pauses to admire the 
               achievement of actually having created life.

               He pulls the trigger. BOOM! A huge flash of powder, an 
               eruption of smoke. The Creature dodges the shot, still coming. 
               Victor raises the other gun. BOOM! Another flash of smoke. 
               Still the Creature comes.

               Victor. Frantic. Manually spinning the cylinders, cocking, 
               firing. BOOM! A miss. BOOM! Another miss. Spinning. cocking.

               Firing. BOOM! BOOM! Spinning. Cocking...

               ...And the Creature is on him, slapping the pistols clean 
               out of his hands. The guns sail through the air, spinning 
               off across the ice. Victor panics, turns to run... And slips 
               over the edge of the precipice.

               Victor falls SCREAMING, arms and legs windmilling through a 
               30-foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. He looks 
               up. The Creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge 
               to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a 
               cat-like crouch. He pulls Victor from the snow and sends him 
               sliding across the ice with a mighty heave...

               INT - ICE CAVE - DAY

               ...right into the mouth of an ice-cave, Victor comes tumbling 
               and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to 
               sprawl heavily to the cave floor.

               Winded. Battered. Barely able to move. He glances up to see 
               the cave filled with possessions. Books. Provisions. Extra 
               clothing. The embers of a fire burn low. There is even a 
               rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates.

               A huge shadow fills the cave entrance. The storybook ogre is 
               coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. 
               Victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as 
               the Creature enters...

               ...but the Creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers 
               down. He tosses a few more sticks on the flames. Pause.

                         How did you find me?

               The Creature grabs Victor's journal off the "shelf." He 
               unwinds the thong, the letters spill out.

                         grip... because all I could see was 
                         your face... and all I could feel 
                         was my rage. And when I let him go, 
                         he fluttered to the grass like a 
                         sparrow...

               The Creature gazes down at Willie's body. He stares at the 
               hand that committed the crime as if waking from a dream.

               Tears welling. Overcome with shame and horror.

               He falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail 
               echoing across the countryside as he weeps over the boy.

               Victor stares in horror as the Creature relates his story 
               with tears shining in his monstrous eyes.

               Justine is asleep in the hay. Haggard, wet, exhausted. The 
               Creature looms over her, a monstrous shape backlit by the 
               lightning, gazing on her beauty. His hand reaches down, 
               hovering reverently, wishing to caress the swell of her 
               breasts at the neckline of her bodice ...

                         She was so lovely. I longed to touch 
                         her... and seek her sympathy...

               The locket drops from his hand to dangle in his fingers. He 
               lowers it, tucking it gently away in her pocket

                         ...but I simply returned the object

               Victor is crushed by remorse. A sob escapes him.

               Victor is calming his skittish horse as the Creature looms 
               into view. Victor turns. The Creature tosses Victor his 
               journal. Victor hesitates, jams it into his saddlebag.

                         I'll be waiting. And watching.

               And with that, the Creature turns and scrambles back down 
               the nearly-vertical cliff face, leaping from crags and 
               boulders with superhuman agility. Victor watches him vanish 
               from sight.

               Victor descends the mountain, heading back to civilization.

               Victor walks his horse toward the house. Elizabeth rushes 
               out to meet him with Henry and Claude. Victor hands off the

               Victor glances over. Claude has pulled the Collier pistols 
               from the saddlebags and caught a strong whiff of powder.

               Victor sits at bedside, holding Father's hand. The old man 
               is a weak and frail shadow of his former self.

                         You must regain your strength to

                         are duties you cannot shirk.

               Father smiles faintly.

               Victor squeezes his hand, whispers:

               Murky and dark. Victor enters, yanks a dusty curtain off a

               approaches a stack of crates as if facing an old adversary. 
               One in particular is quite large. He rams the bar into the 
               wood, prying it open... and CAMERA PUSHES IN to reveal a 
               dull gleam of copper lurking within the packing straw.

                         God forgive me.

               MONTAGE:

               Victor assembles his equipment, recreating the lab; bolting 
               together the sarcophagus, now resting in its cradle. Hanging 
               the huge glass tube, adjusting the boom. Installing the 
               ceiling tracks and hoist mechanism. Playing out the copper 
               wire along the ceiling beams. Hooking up the galvanic 
               batteries and generators. Testing the electrical circuit 
               with goggles and thick gloves, getting a huge cascade of 
               sparks...

                         I prayed never to see these again...

               Victor turns. Henry stands in the doorway.

                         Whatever they are.

               Henry enters, runs his hand over the gleaming surface of the 
               sarcophagus, circles toward Victor.

                                     HENRY
                         I won't bother asking what or why. 
                         You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just 
                         hope you know what you're doing...
                              (draws close)

                         pick up the pieces.

               CAMERA PUSHES PAST to the Da Vinci print on the wall, contact 
               points still daubed with red...

               EXT - CEMETERY - NIGHT

               CAMERA DRIFTS among the tombstones to reveal an eerie sight:

               hear the THUNK of a shovel hitting wood

               INT - COFFIN - NIGHT

               ...and the lid wrenches aside to reveal the Creature. He 
               peers down at us, almost close enough to kiss.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - ANGLE FROM ROOF - NIGHT

               The Creature nimbly climbs the outer wall, fingers grasping 
               the brickwork, a dark shape slung over his shoulder. He pauses 
               as a PAIR OF STABLEHANDS pass far below. He pulls himself 
               onto the roof, crosses the gables, and pushes open a dormer 
               window. We see Victor inside as it swings open. The Creature 
               enters with his prize...

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               ...and the mottled corpse of Justine Moritz flops onto the 
               table before us.

               TILT UP TO:

                                     CREATURE
                         I want her.

               Victor stares down in utter horror. Her cold, dead face. 
               Blue lips already beginning to shrivel. Purple, sunken eyes.

               Knowing that she loved him. Knowing it's his fault she's 
               dead. He can barely get the words out:

                                     VICTOR
                         Why... her?

                                     CREATURE
                         Her body pleases me.

               That's it for Victor. He turns away, stomach heaving. It's 
               all he can do to keep from throwing up.

                                     CREATURE
                         Materials, remember? Nothing more. 
                         Your words.

               Victor hesitates, pulling himself together. Softly:

                                     VICTOR
                         My words.

               He turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying 
               not to view it as someone he knows. He cradles the head, 
               probing the back of the neck with his fingers.

                                     VICTOR
                         The brain stem was destroyed by the 
                         hanging. We'll need another. The 
                         body looks like it will do, but some 
                         extremities are too decayed. They'll 
                         have to be replaced. The fresher the 
                         better.

               EXT - ALLEY - RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT

               Outside the back door of a rowdy tavern, we find a PROSTITUTE 
               servicing a SAILOR in the alley: he's got her pressed against 
               the wall, skirt hiked up. It's not long before he's finished. 
               Off he goes, staggering back into the bar. She arranges her 
               skirt, tucking the money away... and pauses, noticing a TALL 
               FIGURE in the shadows. Staring. She approaches with her best 
               saucy smile:

                                     PROSTITUTE
                         Want some yourself? Or just like to 
                         watch?
                              (draws close)
                         What do you say, lover? I can make 
                         it good for you.

               The Creature leans into the light, clamps a massive hand to 
               her mouth. His other arm wraps around her waist, pulling her 
               off the ground. She gazes up, eyes wide, screams muffled in 
               his palm. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         I know you can.

               And he wrenches his arm, snapping her spine.

               INT - ATTIC - NIGHT

               The dead prostitute lies staring up, dried blood staining 
               her mouth. TILT UP to Victor gazing down in horror.

                                     VICTOR
                         What is this?

                                     CREATURE
                         A brain. Extremities.

                                     VICTOR
                         This was not taken from a grave.

                                     CREATURE
                         What does it matter? She'll live 
                         again. You'll make her.

                                     VICTOR
                         No. I draw the line.

               The Creature lashes out and drags Victor across the table.

                                     CREATURE
                         You will honor your promise to me!

                                     VICTOR
                              (through gritted teeth)
                         I will not! Kill me now!

                                     CREATURE
                         That is mild compared to what will 
                         come. If you deny me my wedding night. 
                         I'll be with you on yours.

               The Creature vanishes out the attic window into the night.

               Victor is left gasping for air, staring at the dead 
               prostitute. The full horror sinking in.

               INT - ATTIC STAIRCASE - MORNING

               Victor slams the attic door, securing it with a massive 
               padlock. He hurries down the steps.

               INT - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

               Victor and Elizabeth, intensity flying:

                                     VICTOR
                         No. Not tomorrow, not next week, 
                         Marry me today.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Why the change? What about your work?

                                     VICTOR
                         It was misguided and pointless. Is 
                         your answer yes?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         It is

                                     VICTOR
                         We'll leave this afternoon, right 
                         after the ceremony. Pack only what 
                         you need.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Does this have something to do with 
                         that man you saw?

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         Yes. We're in danger here. Every 
                         moment we stay.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor, tell me why! Trust me!

                                     VICTOR
                         I do. But you must trust me for now.

               INT - BEDROOM - DAY

               A small ceremony has been hurriedly organized at Father's 
               bedside. The old man holds Elizabeth's hand. Softly:

                                     FATHER
                         This is not... the grand wedding... 
                         I had hoped to give you...

               He releases her hand, giving the bride away. She takes her 
               place at Victor's side. Henry stands as best man. The PRIEST 
               faces them:

                                     PRIEST
                         We gather now in the sight of God to 
                         witness this man and woman bond their 
                         lives in matrimonial vow.

               EXT - MANSION - DAY

               Elizabeth gets in the coach. Claude clambers up to the 
               driver's seat armed with a rifle, ready to pull out. EIGHT 
               MEN on horseback provide armed escort. Victor addresses the 
               men staying behind, all of whom are also armed:

                                     VICTOR
                         Be especially on your guard. Stay 
                         cautious to a fault.

                                     STABLE HAND
                         Who is this man, sir? How shall we 
                         know him?

                                     VICTOR
                         He is huge and deformed... and quite 
                         insane.

                                     CLAUDE
                         He killed Master William and sent 
                         Justine Moritz to the noose! No 
                         hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard 
                         on sight!

               CRIES of assent.

               Victor pulls Henry aside:

                                     VICTOR
                         Are you sure you'll be all right?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, don't worry. I'll look after 
                         your father. You look after her.

                                     VICTOR
                         I'll be back as soon as I've got her 
                         far away and safe. We'll hunt this 
                         fiend down together.

                                     HENRY
                         Only if you'll tell me who he is.

                                     VICTOR
                              (hesitates)
                         I owe you that. Done.

               A quick embrace. Victor leaps into the coach.

               ANGLE FROM FATHER'S BEDROOM WINDOW

               The coach clatters up the road, trailed by the eight horsemen. 
               Those left behind scatter across the courtyard.

               Henry turns and walks back toward the house. ANGLE WIDENS to 
               reveal the Creature at the window.  In the bed behind him, 
               The old man stirs, opening his eyes

                                     FATHER
                         Victor?

               ...and sees the Creature turn toward him. Father's eyes go 
               wide as his final stroke is triggered. His life ends with a 
               prolonged death-rattle... and a soft exhale. The Creature 
               reaches down, closes his eyes. A tender gesture.

               A LOUD GASP. The Creature whirls. There stands the priest, 
               dropping his tea to the floor. The Creature sweeps across 
               the room, presses him against the wall.

                                     PRIEST
                              (breathless with horror)
                         You're the Devil himself.

                                     CREATURE
                         Yes, and I've come to snatch your 
                         soul...
                              (leans close)
                         ...unless you tell me where they've 
                         gone.

               EXT - LAKE GENEVA - DUSK

               A magnificent sunset bathes the mountains as storm clouds 
               roll in. A ferry is crossing the lake, moving away from us, 
               rippling the water. TILT DOWN to reveal...

               EXT - FERRY DOCK - DUSK

               Claude trotting to the window of the coach.

                                     CLAUDE
                         That was the last ferry. There's 
                         nothing else till morning.

                                     VICTOR
                         Damn it

                                     CLAUDE
                         We'll ride on ahead and secure you 
                         lodging for the night.

               EXT - RESORT - NIGHT

               A big chalet nestled in the woods by the lake. The storm is 
               raging. Claude and his men are positioned at the entrances.

                                     VICTOR
                         Make sure you keep your pistols dry

                              (draws his saber 
                              halfway)
                         ...we can always gut the bastard.

                                     CLAUDE
                         Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded. 
                         Now why don't you go upstairs to 
                         your wife? It's not often a man has 
                         his wedding night.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles.

               Elizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted 
               through the sheer white nightgown.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You're soaking.

               She approaches, peels off his coat. Victor stares at her, 
               awe-struck. She sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms 
               demurely... then laughs at her own modesty.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Brother and sister no more.

                                     VICTOR
                         Now husband and wife.

               He strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips.

                                     VICTOR
                         I remember the first time I ever saw 
                         you. Crossing the floor of the grand 
                         ballroom with my parents at your 
                         side. So beautiful even then.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (a whisper)
                         I have been waiting for this ever 
                         since.

               She leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, 
               triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable...

               ...kissing, caressing, Victor stripping off his wet shirt, 
               CAMERA DRIFTING around them in slow circles, candles spinning 
               like a fever that's been building for a lifetime... and now 
               onto the bed. Magnificent and canopied. Kneeling together, 
               bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining...

               Elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. Victor 
               sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up 
               the nightgown, making her shudder with desire...

               ...and a SHOT FIRES. Victor jerks up. He can hear SHOUTING.

               He rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed 
               and ready on the nightstand.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Victor!

                                     VICTOR
                         Open this door for no-one!

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               Victor sails past the GUARD at the entrance, brandishing his 
               pistols. The men converge, shouting in the rain:

                                     GUARD #2
                         I saw him in a flash of lightning! 
                         He vanished toward the lake!

                                     CLAUDE
                         Get after him!

               Several men race off in pursuit. TILT UP from Victor and 
               Claude... as a FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the Creature 
               clinging in the branches above their heads with a malevolent 
               smile. He scurries  silently up, further and further into 
               the tree... closer and closer to the balcony.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth. Tense and waiting. A shadow looms across the 
               balcony... spilling through the French doors... onto the 
               floor... a bony hand reaches for the latch...

               The doors burst open on a crust of wind and rain, Elizabeth 
               spins as candles blow out all over the room. The Creature 
               enters, massive and unseen, gliding in shadow. Softly:

                                     CREATURE
                         Don't bother to scream.

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men come running back from the lake. They stop before 
               Victor and Claude.

                                     GUARD #3
                         We lost him.

               And GUARD #4's eyes drift up:

                                     GUARD #4
                         Why are those open?

               Victor spins, gazing up. Breath catching in his throat. The 
               French doors are swaying in the wind.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves 
               inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She 
               makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, 
               spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light 
               of the fireplace.

               The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes 
               between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She 
               peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing:

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You don't want to hurt me.

               He averts his gaze, shamed by her beauty.

                                     CREATURE
                         You're more lovely than I could ever 
                         have imagined.

               FOOTSTEPS come pounding up the stairs. A HEAVY CRASH of men 
               throwing their shoulders at the door...

                                     VICTOR
                         ELIZABETH!

               ...and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls.

               She tries to wrench away. He spins her around so he won't 
               have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. 
               He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest 
               with pile-driver force...

               INT - LANDING (OUTSIDE ROOM) - NIGHT

               ...and her SCREAM is cut short. The men give one last mighty 
               rush at the door...

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               ...and they burst in just in time to see Elizabeth cascade 
               back onto the bed, her chest a massive red stain. The Creature 
               whips toward them, fist glistening with blood...

                                     CREATURE
                         I keep my promises.

               ...and he races across the room as the men OPEN FIRE, 
               shredding the walls to splinters with an explosive fusillade 
               of shots. But the Creature is too fast. He hits the leaded 
               window head-on with the force of an anvil...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               ...and goes sailing out into empty space in a hurricane of 
               shattering glass. He drops 40 feet to the grass below and 
               vanishes like the breeze, greatcoat whipping into darkness.

               INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT

               Victor rushes to the bad and lets loose the most PRIMAL SCREAM 
               OF ALL. He sweeps his limp, murdered bride into his arms, 
               cradling her to his breast, screams trailing off into wracking 
               moans and sobs of despair:

                                     VICTOR
                              (softly)
                         Oh God... he took her heart... he 
                         took her heart from me...

               EXT - CHALET - NIGHT

               The men make way as Victor carries his dead wife through the 
               downpour. He puts her in the coach. Dazed.

               EXT - ROAD - NIGHT

               The coach comes racing through the storm, the horses in a 
               frenzy, faster and faster.

               EXT - MANSION - NIGHT

               Victor whipping the coach veers to a wild stop. Victor jumps 
               down, gathers up the body, and mounts the steps. Henry 
               appears, rushing out into the rain. Victor goes right past 
               him...

               MANSION - NIGHT

               ...and carries Elizabeth through the silent halls.

               ATTIC - NIGHT

               The door swings in. Victor stands dripping. Holding Elizabeth. 
               Gazing at the gleam of copper...

               MONTAGE:

               And we launch into the final throbbing madness. Victor hacking 
               and chopping. Discarding pieces. Sewing the creation, yanking 
               the catgut tight. Ramming the needles deep. Hoisting the 
               body in the air. Slamming the sarcophagus lid, tightening 
               the bolts. Powering up the galvanic circuit, throwing the 
               switch. Screaming at God as the LIGHTNING FLASHES and the 
               body convulses. Wind and rain sweeping through the lab, 
               battering a window open and shut, open and shut. Lowering 
               the glass tube, ramming phallus into womb. Releasing the 
               eels, huge black sperm squirming and writhing toward the 
               spasming egg The body. Convulsing. Lashing. Screaming in the 
               copper womb. Hair whipping in the fluid...

               Victor shuts down the machinery. He opens the tank and reaches 
               into the fluid with his thick rubber gloves. He pulls out 
               his creation, cradling the head and neck as one would cradle 
               a newborn infant's...

               ...And wipes the muck away with his glove to reveal 
               Elizabeth's face, Massive suture marks bisect her neck and 
               collarbone where pieces were joined. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Live.

               Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to 
               draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. She erupts, thrashing 
               in the vat. He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start 
               her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft 
               murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave 
               violently to dispel the fluid...

               He lifts her gently out. Wipes off the muck as she shivers 
               and shakes, spasms easing off. Cleansing her face. Clasping 
               her hand in his. Comfort and strength...

               Helping her to her feet. Jerky and unsure. Lean on me.

               Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, 
               draping it... and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up 
               with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. A whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name.

               Blank. Dazed. Stunned. Not a flicker of recognition.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you 
                         remember. Say my name.

               Nothing. He leans forward... and kisses her dead lips.

               Gentle as a sigh. A flicker in her eyes?

                                     VICTOR
                         You must. You must.

               Maybe his imagination. Still whispering:

                                     VICTOR
                         Say my name. Say you remember.

               And slowly... ever so slowly... she raises her bony white 
               hand before her eyes... staring at it... trying to puzzle it 
               out... its meaning... perhaps the vaguest shred of 
               recognition... and the hand continues to rise... creeping 
               slowly toward his shoulder... and coming to rest there. He 
               smiles, blinking back tears...

                                     VICTOR
                         Yes. I'll help you remember.

               And he takes her other hand in his. At first it's 
               imperceptible... just the slightest motion, perhaps nothing, 
               perhaps just a shift of balance... and then it grows into 
               the vaguest sway... and tears are glistening in Victor's 
               eyes as she begins to move. Lurching. Faltering. Unsure.

               You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for 
               guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong.

               Trace memories.

               A waltz.

               And here we are treated to the most sweepingly romantic and 
               hair-raisingly demented image of the film: Frankenstein dances 
               with his dead bride, showing her the way, begging her to 
               remember, please remember, and now our WALTZ/LOVE THEME really 
               comes back to haunt us as the MUSIC SWELLS, incredibly lush 
               and deranged, dissonant and echoing through Victor's head, 
               music only he can hear...

                                     VICTOR
                         ...one-two-three, twirl-two-three.

               ...and the worst part? The very worst thing of all? There on 
               the shelf. A large formaldehyde jar. Justine's severed head. 
               Watching them through the glass with dead, sightless eyes. 
               Watching them dance. Still a wallflower? No. She's finally 
               finishing her dance with Victor... most of her, anyway. Under 
               the circumstances, it'll have to do...

               ...and the waltz goes on, madder and madder, sweeping in 
               glorious circles as a dazzling array of LIGHTNING bathes 
               them in its wild, jittering spotlight, shadows careening 
               across the walls, INSANE MUSIC swelling louder and louder, 
               climbing higher and higher, reaching toward its crescendo 
               with jagged glass claws...

               ...and it all screeches to a stop as the door bursts in. 
               Music echoes abruptly away into silence. Nothing now but 
               rain and distant thunder. In the doorway:

                                     CREATURE
                         She's beautiful.

                                     VICTOR
                         She's not for you.

                                     CREATURE
                         I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. 
                         Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper 
                         suitor.

               The Creature raises his hand. Beckoning. She takes a faltering 
               step. Drawn to him.

                                     VICTOR
                         Elizabeth, no!
                              (she turns, puzzled)
                         Say my name.

               Her face reflects horror and shame, like a brain-damaged 
               child who's wet the bed. She knows she's supposed to 
               remember... but can't remember what remembering means.

               They both motion to her. Murmuring. Begging. She's caught 
               between them, pulled like a diaphanous rope in a tug of war.

               Please... come with me. Please... remember. She finally tilts 
               toward the Creature. Gazing into his eyes. Studying his face. 
               Fingertips tracing his massively scarred flesh. A beat. A 
               frown. A puzzlement. This isn't right. People don't look 
               like this. They're not stitched together out of pieces of 
               flesh like a patchwork.

               She looks at her own hands. Dead and white. Not even hers.

               One belongs to Justine. Another to a prostitute, suture scars 
               marring the wrist. She looks down at herself. The dead, 
               sagging breasts. The body that isn't hers either. Realization 
               creeping into her eyes. Realization and horror. Turning to 
               Victor. Why do I look like this? What's happened to me? Oh 
               God, what's happened to me?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Vic... tor?

                                     CREATURE
                         ...no...

               ...and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest 
               pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. 
               She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to 
               find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to 
               peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her 
               own eyes.

               Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering 
               toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. 
               The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside.

                                     CREATURE
                         GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!

                                     VICTOR
                         SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY 
                         NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!

               Yes. She remembers. Not much, but enough. She breaks away 
               from them as they grapple, still SHRIEKING as she sails across 
               the room, tipping furniture, equipment flying...

               ...over straight to the kerosene lamp, snatching it up before 
               they can stop her.

                                     VICTOR
                         NO!

               She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay 
               with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. 
               But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing 
               in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her... 
               loathing for herself for what she's become.

               It turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no 
               part of it... or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp 
               in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. 
               WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts 
               past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead 
               flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as 
               she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the 
               Creature racing after her...

               INT - UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

               ...and she sails down the hallway, setting FIRE to everything 
               she passes, SCREAMING for the final torment to end. She hurls 
               herself over the railing, drapes catching ablaze as she 
               plummets to the floor far below. A pillar of flame leaps up 
               on impact.

               VICTOR AND THE CREATURE face each other as flames sweep the 
               walls, combusting the upper hallway into a raging tunnel in 
               Hell.

                                     VICTOR
                         You killed her! You killed her!

               He hurls himself at the Creature, who backhands him spinning 
               down the hallway, sprawling to the floor. The Creature gazes 
               down at his Maker one last time...

                                     CREATURE
                         We killed her.

               And then vanishes through the smoke and flames.

               EXT - FRANKENSTEIN ESTATE - DAY

               The once-magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath 
               a merciless gray sky. Charred beams and drifting smoke are 
               all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family.

               Victor stands gazing at the house. A windswept, hollow man 
               Bundled in a rough coat. Flintlock rifle dangling at his 
               side. Henry moves into frame some distance behind. Softly:

                                     HENRY
                         Victor.

               No reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard.

               He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack 
               horse. The animal stands saddled and ready.

               He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a 
               restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a 
               stranger... and then his features soften.

                                     VICTOR
                         All that I once loved lies in a 
                         shallow grave. By my hand.

                                     HENRY
                         Let it go.

               Victor pauses, emotions swirling. Wishing he could grab the 
               dangling thread of sanity Henry has offered... but knowing 
               the thread is a bittersweet illusion. A bare whisper:

                                     VICTOR
                         You should have been my father's 
                         son. He would have been so proud.

               Victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his 
               horse. Henry runs after him, shouting:

                                     HENRY
                         VICTOR! COME BACK!

               But Victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance. 
               The past is dead. Henry watches Victor until he's gone from 
               sight, as Willie did so long ago...

               EXT - MONT BLANC GLACIER - DAY

               The solitary rider and his mount traverse the windswept 
               glacier ...

               INT - THE CREATURE'S CAVE - DAY

               Victor slides down the entrance, rifle cradled. The cave is 
               now deserted, all possessions gone, a scorched black spot 
               where the campfire had been...

               EXT - GLACIER - DAY

               A panorama of snow. Pristine... save for the long trail of 
               footprints stretching off before us.

               Victor's face thrusts into frame, gazing at the craggy 
               horizon, breath punching the air with billows of vapor.

               He slogs onward, following the tracks, leading his horse by 
               the reins. Dwindling across the frozen landscape.

                                     ARCTIC VICTOR (V.O.)
                         I followed his trail north... always 
                         north... and always one step behind... 
                         never stopping... driven by my fires 
                         of rage... and revenge...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - TWILIGHT

               Victor lies in Walton's bed, sallow as a corpse, barely able 
               to speak, drained now of everything.

                                     VICTOR
                         A year now I've followed him. Perhaps 
                         more. Only to arrive at this place. 
                         Tired. So very tired. I never did 
                         find... whatever it was... I was 
                         looking for... and neither will you, 
                         my friend.
                              (off Walton's look)
                         Value life above ambition... or those 
                         glittering prizes you seek will 
                         crumble to dust in your fingers... 
                         as they have in mine.
                              (reaches out feverishly)
                         See your loved ones again. I cannot.

               Walton takes Victor's hand, lays it gently back to his chest. 
               Softly:

                                     WALTON
                         Rest now.

               Victor is silent. His breathing shallow. Walton just sits 
               And waits...

               A SLOW DISSOLVE marks the passage of Walton's long vigil...

               Victor's eyes flutter open as if staring at something unseen. 
               Perhaps, the faces of those he loved. The eyes glaze. A 
               peaceful death. Walton rises. Puts on his heavy coat to ward 
               off the chill. Exits the cabin.

               EXT - NEVSKY - ON DECK - TWILIGHT

               Grigori is leaning on the gunwale, staring off across the 
               ice. His coat is open. Walton joins him. Surprised at how 
               warm it is. He holds up his hand, testing the breeze.

                                     WALTON
                         A warming wind.

                                     GRIGORI
                         This ice will break yet.
                              (glances over)
                         How's our guest?

                                     WALTON
                         He died. Raving about phantoms. He 
                         was mad, poor devil.
                              (beat)
                         Gather a detail. Have the body removed 
                         from my cabin.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Aye, Captain.

               Grigori moves off to gather help. Walton turns and heads 
               back to his cabin.

               INT - WALTON'S CABIN - NIGHT

               Walton enters... and freezes at the sound of SOFT WEEPING.

               He can't see the bad from here. Could it be the dead man? He 
               glances down. Wet footprints lead across the floor.

               He eases forward. The tiny bed chamber comes slowly into 
               view. A DARK FIGURE is hunched and weeping at bedside, holding 
               the corpse's hand. Walton is stunned.

                                     WALTON
                         Who are you?

               The figure swivels its head, revealing its face to the dim 
               yellow light:

                                     CREATURE
                         He never gave me a name.

               Walton hisses a terrified intake of breath. He lunges to the 
               desk, slaps his hand on the pistol lying there. A frozen 
               beat. Wondering if he should snatch it up. Eyes dancing with 
               fear and speculation. The Creature makes no move. Unconcerned.

                                     CREATURE
                         You were with him at the end.

                                     WALTON
                              (finds his voice)
                         Yes.

                                     CREATURE
                         I was watching.

               Walton glances to the porthole, ajar and creaking in the 
               breeze, chilled at the thought. The Creature returns his 
               gaze to Victor.

                                     CREATURE
                         I longed to be with him. But I wanted 
                         his final moments to have peace. I 
                         could see you were a friend to him.

                                     WALTON
                         What is that to you? Evil as you 
                         are.

                                     CREATURE
                              (swivels his gaze)
                         I am as he made me. In his own image.

                                     WALTON
                         You drove him to his torment.

                                     CREATURE
                         And he drove me to mine.

                                     WALTON
                         Then why weep for him?

                                     CREATURE
                         Would you not? He was father. And 
                         mother. We fell from grace together. 
                         He from his God. I from mine.

               The Creature gently strokes Victor's cheek. He reaches up 
               with two fingers, closes the staring eyes. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         Could we ever have forgiven?

               The question goes unanswered. The Creature rises, gliding in 
               shadow to the door. Pauses.

                                     CREATURE
                         I've never been shown a kindness. 
                         Show me one now.

                                     WALTON
                         What kindness?

                                     CREATURE
                         Build for him a pyre. Light up the 
                         sky with his passing.

               And then the Creature is gone, vanishing smoothly into the 
               night...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The crew of the Nevsky are on the ice, chopping up the fallen 
               mast, axes rising and falling in waves...

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               The body of Victor Frankenstein lies on an impressive bier 
               of wood, stacked and lashed. His body is wrapped in rough 
               canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice.

               Walton and crew stand facing the bier. Walton silently reads 
               a passage from the Bible. Oily black smoke from a small 
               campfire drifts past.

               Walton closes the book. Amens are muttered. Walton glances 
               to Grigori and nods. Grigori moves forward with two other 
               men. They begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it.

               Walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. He 
               dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. The men 
               back away, preparing for the coming blaze...

               ...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. The 
               men pause. Gazing across the ice. Dread seeping into their 
               bones. There's a figure out there. Huge and humanlike in 
               frame. Loping slowly over the ice. Approaching.

                                     PILOT
                              (softly)
                         Christ.

               Grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks 
               the flintlock. Walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, 
               denying his aim.

                                     WALTON
                         It has a right to bear witness.

               Grigori hesitates, nods. If you say so. The men grow more 
               unsettled as the Creature draws nearer. Frightened muttering. 
               Men start backing toward the ship.

                                     WALTON
                         Stand fast. All of you.

               The men stand fast. The Creature stops some thirty yards 
               out. A silent tableau on the ice. The men facing the Creature. 
               Walton holding the torch. The pyre waiting for the kiss of 
               flame. Walton moves forward...

               ...and a THUNDEROUS CRACK is heard, The men whip their heads 
               as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some 
               fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again.

               It's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an 
               earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and 
               force: CRACK! Another eruption. CRACK! And another. CRACK!

               Ice cascading skyward.

                                     OLD SAILOR
                         THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!

                                     GRIGORI
                              (whips toward Walton)
                         TORCH THE DAMN THING!

               Walton rushes forward. CRACK! The ice erupts before him. The 
               torch goes flying. Walton sprawls flat on his back.

                                     WALTON
                         BACK TO THE SHIP!

               The men don't have to be told twice. They're already in full 
               retreat, scrambling for their lives. Ice is detonating for 
               miles around as if pounded by artillery. Grigori helps Walton 
               to his feet. The torch lies burning not ten feet away. A 
               heartbeat of hesitation. Walton wondering if he should go 
               for it. Grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve...

                                     GRIGORI
                         LEAVE IT!

               ...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift 
               opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course 
               across the ice, separating them from the torch.

               They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the 
               others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels.

               THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein 
               snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice.

               NO

               He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a 
               massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of 
               cascading water and spinning fragments.

               THE NEVSKY

               The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to 
               the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the 
               ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see:

               THE CREATURE

               racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a 
               wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him 
               from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.

               THE NEVSKY

               breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, 
               triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew 
               hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet 
               into the icy water.

               THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped 
               on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to 
               plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice 
               crashing down after him. Gone.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI  are knocked flat as a fissure appears 
               between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a 
               teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back 
               but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping 
               maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him.

               Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag 
               him off... but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the 
               ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori 
               thunderously into the drink.

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as 
               she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching 
               the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to 
               the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their 
               fellows from the water, hauling them to safety.

               FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on 
               its own ice floe.

               THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning.

               ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL

               Walton is on hands and knees, scrambling on shifting pieces 
               of ice, thrusting his arms into the water, screaming:

                                     WALTON
                         GRIGORI!

               The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and 
               strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms 
               thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight 
               of his own clothing.

               Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water 
               himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's 
               dying right in front of Walton's eyes.

                                     WALTON
                         SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!

               Too late. Grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing 
               for good beneath the frigid water. Gone. Walton throws his 
               head back with a bellow of anguish...

               ...and Grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly And 
               impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against 
               the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. He 
               gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... 
               and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and 
               up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath 
               him. The face of a nightmare.

               The Creature lunges hugely, hurling Grigori through the air 
               right into Walton's arms. Both men go sprawling. Walton 
               scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the Creature.

               The monster is exhausted. Near his limit. Walton thrusts out 
               his arm, fingers grasping to help.

                                     WALTON
                         Swim.

               The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting 
               away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to 
               him. Come. Grab my hand.

               The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the 
               torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps 
               him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice.

               CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered 
               by ice floes on all sides. Going under.

               WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated 
               ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding 
               nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught.

               Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water 
               and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard.

               BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony 
               fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand.

               The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion 
               and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high.

               Swims grimly on.

               ABOARD THE NEVSKY

               The crew bundle Walton and Grigori in blankets, both men 
               shivering with exposure. Walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing 
               off. The men crowd to his-side.

               THE CREATURE swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch 
               held high to keep it burning. Relentlessly determined. This 
               is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. Gasping and 
               sinking beneath the surface...

               ...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe 
               upon which lies Frankenstein's funeral pyre. He hauls himself 
               from the water. Moving now in a slow-motion litany of 
               exhaustion. Climbing the pyre. Scaling the wood. Seeking the 
               top. Never giving up.

               The Creature joins his Maker atop the bier, straddling the 
               wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's 
               way to the Netherworld, Frankenstein's personal boatman across 
               the River Styx. Frankenstein himself lies serenely at his 
               creation's knees, content to be shown the way...

               The Creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading 
               his arms wide in sublime triumph. Feeling the wind on his 
               skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. Cold. 
               So very cold.

               He glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, 
               pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. He looks 
               down. At Frankenstein. The oil-soaked canvas. The saturated 
               wood. There's that smell. Yes. He scoops Victor up with his 
               free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother 
               comforting a baby.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze in horror. Realization dawning:

                                     GRIGORI (SOFTLY)
                         Don't do it...
                              (screaming)
                         FOR GOD'S SAKE! DON'T DO IT!

               THE CREATURE

               turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering 
               in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the 
               sympathy held so long sought. A whisper:

                                     CREATURE
                         For God's sake... I will.

               And he rams the torch into the pyre beneath him. White-hot 
               ignition. Ultimate redemption. WHUMP! A massive BALL OF FLAME 
               engulfs the bier, pushing a huge fiery fist into the sky. 
               Blossoming. Roiling.

               WALTON AND THE CREW gaze on in wonder and horror as:

               THE CREATURE rides the burning pyre, a shrieking revenant 
               wrapped in a caul of fire, screaming in the flames. Hair 
               going up at a sizzling flashpoint. Cheeks billowing out, 
               peeling back in the blast-furnace heat. Flesh cleansing from 
               bone. Teeth charring and turning black. Still cradling Victor. 
               Still screaming. waiting for the final torment to end. Perhaps 
               it never will...

               FRANKENSTEIN'S PYRE drifts off into the arctic twilight 
               trailing a huge column of flame and smoke, inhuman screams 
               echoing endlessly. Lost in the darkness and distance.

               WALTON stands at the gunwale, his crew at his side. The 
               borealis dances mysteriously on the horizon. Distant slivers 
               of lightning kiss the world. Softly:

                                     WALTON
                         Home

               EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT

               HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The 
               Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through 
               a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET
                         
          A horribly deformed figure--hunchback, misshapen head--sits
          on a stool in complete silhouette. This is RICK COOGAN.
                         
                          RICK
           Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie
           Lee? One day I'm a hot young
           movie star, and the next day I'm a
           hideous mutant freak, covered with
           festering lesions.
                         
          Oddly, REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette.
                         
                          REGIS
           Sounds like my wife when she misses
           a mudpack!
                         
          The audience CRACKS UP. Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis.
                         
                          KATHIE LEE
           Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha-
           ha!
           (to Rick, she turns
                          EARNEST)
           Ricky, once you were the all-
           American boy next door, star of the
           beloved Hey Dude films. Now the
           very mention of your name makes
           children scream in terror. We've
           all read about your disturbing
           story. But the people want to hear
           it from you, Ricky Coogan.
           (SFX: children scream)
           Won't you tell us your story?
                         
                          RICK
           Well, it's kinda long, but okay.
           It all started when I signed a deal
           to be spokesman for the E.E.S.
           conglomerate...
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          INT. E.E.S. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          The E.E.S. logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it,
          with the words "Everything Except Shoes" beneath. Widen to
          reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to
          camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff
          movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES
          photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind
          Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his
          entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRIT
          GUIDE.
           2.
                         
                         
          Further off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD
          CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed
          expressions.
                         
                          RICK
           (through a clenched smile)
           So, what kind of crap do you
           scumbags want me to peddle?
                         
                          HERTZ
           Everything. Everything except
           shoes, of course. Hah hah...
                         
          He laughs pathetically. Rick doesn't respond. Hertz nods to
          a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Meaty Twig Beef Sticks.
                         
          Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. Smiles.
          Flash.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Helmet Head hair spray.
                         
          He takes the hair spray and holds it up. Smile. Flash.
                         
          The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal
          container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.
          Hertz gives it to Rick.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro-
           fertilizer.
                         
          Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.
                         
                          RICK
           Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not
           do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a
           star, got it, Hertz?
           (to his aide)
           Rico, give these misguided clowns
           Tony Danza's phone number, and
           let's get the hell out of here.
                         
          He gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly
          takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls
          after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up
           to the radicals trying to keep
           Noxon from the struggling farmers
           whose very future depends on it.
           3.
                         
                         
                          RICK
                          (HESITATES)
           Noxon? Wasn't that just banned?
                         
                          HERTZ
           Only in the U.S....and Europe.
                         
                          RICK
           But I heard that shit's lethal.
                         
          Hertz lets out a big laugh. He shakes his head at Rick.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Rick, Rick, Rick... You want
           proof? Fine. Just take a seat.
           Please.
                         
          Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table,
          across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a
          placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an
          aide, who scurries off.
                         
                          HERTZ
                          (TO RICK)
           Meet the head of our South American
           research facility, Juan Valdez.
                         
          The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a
          natty three-piece suit and a sombrero.
                         
                          GEORGE
           My name is George Ramirez.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Whatever. He's worked with Noxon
           24 every day for five years, and
           he's in fine shape. Aren't you,
           Juan?
                         
          George glares at Hertz bitterly. Hertz stares him down.
                         
                          GEORGE
           Yes. I am fine. Me and my team in
           Santa Flan have--

           Santa "Flan?" What kind of shitty
           name for a country is that?
                         
                          GEORGE
           It is named for the patron saint of
           creamy desserts... As I was
           saying, we've worked very closely
           with Noxon...
           4.
                         
                         
          Rick nods. We cut back to George, but he isn't George
          anymore. He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the
          same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           I personally supervised its
           development...
                         
          Rick furrows his brow. He's a little suspicious of George's
          transformation, but just a little.
                         
          Now George is even shorter, even swarthier. Yet another
          actor.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           I performed rigorous scientific
           tests. No potential danger was
           left uninvestigated...
                         
          Rick's suspicion is increasing. He looks over to Hertz, who
          feigns total innocence.
                         
          George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His
          clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down
          over his face.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           The environmentalists are
           crackpots, all of them.
                         
          Rick looks at his entourage. Their mouths hang open in
          astonishment.
                         
          George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions. The
          sombrero completely covers his head. When he takes it off,
          we see he's now played by LINDA HUNT!
                         
                          GEORGE
           It's ridiculous, I tell you.
           Totally ridiculous!
                         
          Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Thank you, Valdez. That will be
           all.
                         
          George nods and heads back to his seat. As he passes behind
          Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and
          making a face.
                         
                          RICK
           Wait a second--
           5.
                         
                         
                          HERTZ
           Ricky, this is important. We're
           talking about a major threat to the
           EES image. How does 2 million
           dollars plus expenses sound?
                         
          The aide reveals a new placard on the easel. It reads "$2
          MILLION."
                         
                          RICK
           Look, it sounds great, but--
                         
                          HERTZ
           I hear you. Make it five million--
           (a new placard: 5 MILLION)
           that is, if the board agrees ...
                         
          Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. The old
          geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were
          being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Good, it's unanimous. Well, what
           do you say, Ricky? Are you EES's
           "Man in Santa Flan?"
                         
          Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt,
          then emphatically shake their heads "NO." Rick looks at
          Hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. Rick breaks
          into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up
          sign.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. L.A. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECK
                         
          Rick stands in line at the luggage X-ray machine. He
          impatiently checks his watch as the X-RAY CHECKER chats him
          up. A CRAZED ANARCHIST holding a large bomb passes through
          the security check unquestioned.
                         
                          X-RAY CHECKER
           My kids just loved you in "Hey Dude
           Three: The Final Countdown." We
           need more wholesome role models
           like you.
                         
                          RICK
           Uh-huh.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Where the fuck is Ernie?
           6.
                         
                         
          We hear WOMEN'S SCREAMS. They turn towards the noise and see
          a bunch of STEWARDESSES scattering from a trendy young cad
          with a fake hand sticking out of his fly. This is ERNIE,
          Rick's buddy and resident court jester.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Ladies! All I wanted was a
           manicure! Yah-ha-ha!
           (he sees Rick)
           IT'S THE COOG!
                         
                          RICK
           IT'S THE ERNIE! WOOF! WOOF!
           WOOF!
                         
          Rick pumps Ernie's third "hand." The miffed X-ray checker
          points to Rick's large carry-on bag as it emerges from the X-
          ray machine.
                         
                          X-RAY CHECKER
                          (TO RICK)
           Mister Coogan, is this your bag?
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, why?
                         
                          X-RAY CHECKER
           Is this your kid?
                         
          He indicates the X-ray monitor, where we see the skeleton
          outline of a BUCKTOOTHED, BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID curled
          up in Rick's bag. The kid waves. Rick and Ernie look at
          each other in horror.
                         
                          RICK/ERNIE
           Stuey Gluck!
                         
          The bag bursts open, and out pops STUEY GLUCK, an obsessive
          young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and
          memorabilia.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare
           still from your high school
           production of The Glass Menagerie!
           Could you sign it for me?
           Please?!
                         
                          RICK
           NO!
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Let's get the hell out of here!
           7.
                         
                         
          Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run
          away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8
          by 10 photo.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Wait up!
                         
          FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
                         
          Rick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Remember the speech you gave
           at the Actors Forum for Social
           Justice!?
                         
          He holds up a cassette player and hits play. It's Rick's old
          speech.
                         
           RICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE)
           If all the world is a stage, then
           let us shine the spotlight on
           truth, integrity, and a deep
           compassion for all life.
                         
                          RICK
           Leave me alone, troll!
                          (TO ERNIE)
           That was before I got an
           entertainment lawyer.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Quick, down here.
                         
          Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway.
                         
          IN THE HALLWAY
                         
          It's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives
          Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the
          hallway. He holds up a Time magazine.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's
           dangerous. Why are you lending
           your name to it? What's happened
           to you, Rick? You used to be
           good! And now... I just don't
           know...
                         
          Stuey starts to cry. Rick looks guilty.
                         
                          RICK
           Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good.
           8.
                         
                         
          BAM! A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full
          speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody
          murder.
                         
                          RICK
           ALRIGHT!
                         
          Rick and Ernie high five.

          INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY
                         
          A SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The
          anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks
          suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not
          interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy
          confidence.
                         
                          RICK
           In the bag.
                         
          The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of
          his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another
          STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead
          compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear
          the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker.
                         
           CAPTAIN (V.0.)
           Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
           captain speaking. To the right of
           the aircraft, you can see a great
           view of the Grand Canyon.
                         
          All the passengers crane their necks to the right.
                         
           CAPTAIN (V.0.)
           And to the left you can see a panic-
           stricken little troll.
                         
          Rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to
          reveal...
                         
                         STUEY
                         
          on the wing, pressing his face up against the glass. He's
          holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something
          we can't hear.
                         
                          RICK
           AHHHHHHH!
                         
          Stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing. Rick
          watches him fall into oblivion.
           9.
                         
          Relieved, he turns nonchalantly to Ernie, ignoring the other
          horrified passengers.
                         
                          RICK

          Stuey's approaching scream.

           AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...
                         
          THUD! Stuey misses the haystack by a few feet. He hops to
          his feet and dusts himself off.
                         
                          STUEY
           Hey, I'm okay!

           Sure glad that wasn't our plane.
                         
          Ernie nods. They're distracted by the sound of chanting.
          They squint into the distance, where they see a group of
          chanting PROTESTERS--young "Save the Earth" types, latter-day
          hippies, kids, seniors, etc.
                         
                          PROTESTERS
           EES mustn't stay! Take your toxic
           crap away! EES mustn't stay!
           (etc.)
                         
          Some of their signs read--"Say No to Noxon!", "Coogan Go
          Home", "EES is killing our Earth!", "Ricky Coogan Sucks Shit"
          (this one held by a nice LITTLE GIRL), "I Like Ike" (held by
          a confused OLD MAN, shuffling around aimlessly), "Drink
          Pepsi" and finally...
                         
          "Free Nelson Mandela"--we WIDEN to reveal the subheading:
          "Inside specially marked boxes." We keep WIDENING to reveal
          that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal
          some GUY is eating as he watches the protest.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Jesus! We better find the limo
           before these whale kissers chop us
           up and sell us for parts.
           (he spots the limo)
           There it is.
                         
          Off to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo
          with tinted windows (and plates that say NOT EES) awaits.
          KEVIN, an EES exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly
          at Ricky. The stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras
          out the back window invitingly.
                         
          Ernie tries to grab Ricky by the arm, but he resists. He's
          looking at the protesters.
                         
                          RICK
           Wait a second...
                         
          His POV...
                         
          A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
                         
          standing in the center of the crowd of protesters, holding a
          MEGAPHONE to her mouth and chanting. She puts down the
          megaphone to rest, and we can see that she's powerfully
          beautiful, in a no-nonsense feminist kind of way. This is
          JULIE. Rick is smitten.
           11.
                         
                         
                          ERNIE
           Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'.
                         
                          RICK
           Forget them. I got a better idea.
           If I can just find the right
           disguise...
                         
                          ERNIE
           Coog, those hippies'll tear us
           apart.
                         
          Rick spots a HEAVILY BANDAGED MAN limping out of the airport
          on crutches. Rick approaches him, waving a roll of bills.
                         
                          RICK
           Hey, how'd you like to make a quick
           hundred bucks?
                         
          The man mutters something weakly. Ernie puts his ear up
          close to hear him better.
                         
                          ERNIE
           He says the pants don't usually
           come off for less than two-fifty,
           but since you're so cute, he'll
           make an exception.
                         
                          FLIP TO:
                         
                         RICK
                         
          buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages, making his way
          through the protesters on crutches. Ernie helps him along,
          nervously. As Rick spots Julie from behind, he hands the
          crutches over to Ernie.
                         
                          RICK
           Here.
                         
          Ernie takes the crutches. Rick waves his arms dramatically,
          clutches his bandaged legs, and winces in pain.
                         
                          RICK
           Help! Ow! Give me back my
           crutches! You monster! Oh, the
           pain! The agony!
                         
          He falls theatrically at Julie's feet.
                         
                          JULIE
           Are you okay? Let me help you!
           12.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Thanks. Don't worry about me.
           What's one man's pain weighed
           against the global injustice of
           corporate tyrants like EES? Go.
           The fight must continue.
                         
          Julie's buying it big time. She gazes deep into Rick's eyes.
                         
                          JULIE
           Wow... My name's Julie.
                         
                          RICK
           Josh. Josh Tavner.
                         
          Ernie sticks a hand out, grinning sarcastically.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you.
                         
          Julie turns on Ernie viciously. She slaps him hard, and
          grabs the crutches from him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Ow! Hey!
                         
                          JULIE
           Give me those, ape. Help him up.
                         
          Rick rises to his feet "painfully."
                         
                          JULIE
           Hey Josh, a busload of us are
           headed over to Maracas to protest
           Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with
           cow shit.
                         
                          RICK
           Same here! You could ride with us.
                         
                          JULIE
           Us? You're with him?
                         
          She looks at Ernie, who grins stupidly.
                         
                          RICK
           Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard
           of an idiot savant?
                         
                          JULIE
           Sure.
                         
                          RICK
           That's Ernie. Except for the
           savant part.
           13.
                         
                         
          Ernie glares at Rick. Rick smiles at Julie hopefully. Julie
          looks at them both, and can't help smiling herself.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CAR - DAY
                         
          Ernie drives the battered old convertible which bears the
          proud logo of Santa Flan Rent-a-Car. There's a Pepsi
          billboard in the background. Julie massages Rick in the back
          seat.
                         
                          RICK
           (faking terrible pain)
           Ooooh, my pelvis.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (SYMPATHETIC)
           Is this better?
                         
          ERNIE'S POV IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
                         
          Rick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages.
          Ernie tries to get in on the conversation.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an
           idea man myself. Like, let's say
           there's a nuclear war, and the only
           two people left are you and the
           Pope... Would you pork him?
                         
          Disgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging
          Rick. Scowling with jealousy, Ernie tries a new approach.
                         
                          ERNIE
           But one thing's for sure. That
           Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh?
                         
                          JULIE
           I'll say! What a total piece of
           shit. Don't you think so, Josh?
                         
          Rick grits his teeth.
                         
                          RICK
                          (MUMBLES NONCOMMITTALLY)
           Well, he's got a few problems.
                         
                          JULIE
           And what a lousy actor! I mean can
           you believe that "Hey Dude" crap?
           14.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Well, with a script that bad,
           Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming
           off as good as he did!
                          (CATCHES HIMSELF)
           I mean, that's what I read.
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, he's no Christian Slater.
                         
                          RICK
                          (EXPLODES)
           SLATER!? I could act circles
           around that one-note hack! He was
           shittin' his diapers when I was the
           toast of Broadway! I made grown
           men cry! I made crippled children
           laugh! Now all I ever hear is
           Slater! Slater! Slater! WELL
           SLATER CAN KISS MY ASS! YOU HEAR
           ME?
                         
          Enraged, Rick rips the bandages off his face.
                         
                          RICK
           You think Slater could improv like
           this? Make you believe he was an
           invalid!? Huh!?
                         
          Julie stares at him in shock. Rick catches his breath,
          realizes what he's just done, and smiles weakly. Ernie tries
          to break the awkward silence.
                         
                          ERNIE
                          (TO JULIE)
           So, do you like Swedish films?
                         
          Julie gives him a murderous look.

          Julie's been lecturing Rick for some time now.
                         
                          JULIE
           You don't even want to hear the

           stuff is going to turn anyone into
           a... a...
                         
                         RICK'S POV
                         
          on the road behind Julie he sees a crude carnival billboard
          featuring a painting of a huge worm with a man's head. It
          reads "See the Incredabel Humin Werm! Only at Elijah C.
          Skuggs Famus Freek Land." Julie can't see it.
                         
                          RICK
                          (DISTRACTED)
           Human worm...
                         
                          JULIE
           Right. A human worm. I mean,
           that's just stupid. The point is--
                         
          Rick sees another billboard for the freak show. This one
          features a half-man/half-dog creature and says "See the
          Aztownding Dawg Boy!"
                         
                          RICK
           Dog boy...
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah, or a dog boy. That's absurd.
                          BUT--
                         
          Another billboard. This one features the "Hidyous Frawg
          Man."
                         
                          RICK
           Hideous frog man.
                         
                          JULIE
           Okay, okay. Now you're just being
           silly. Human suffering's just a
           big joke to you, huh? You are
           sick, Coogan!
                         
          She turns away from him in a huff and looks out her window.
          She sees a billboard that reads "See The Hole Amazing Famly
          of Freekz at Elijah C. Skuggs Famus Freek Land and Mutent
          Emporeum!"
                         
                          JULIE
           Cool! A freak show! Let's check
           it out!
                         
                          RICK
           Kind of like a family reunion for

          EXT. JUNGLE ROADWAY
                         
          The car turns into a driveway near a crude, hand painted sign
          that says "FreekzTM--Thiss waey" with a messy arrow...
                         
          We ZOOM IN to the hand painted "small print" on the bottom of
          the sign, which reads--"Freekz is a registered trademark of
          Elijah C. Skuggs Enterprises. Any unauthorized reproduction
          is strictly prohibited without prior written consent."
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. FREEKZ COMPOUND
                         
          The car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just
          past a sizzling electric fence. Rick, Julie, and Ernie get
          out and look around. It's eerily quiet.
                         
          There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted
          ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with
          an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy
          broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant
          molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly
          rotates on a creaky base.
                         
          Ernie looks hard at the big eyes. He turns away for a
          second, then spins around again. The EYES are looking in a
          different direction. Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a
          chocolate bar.
                         
                          JULIE
           Isn't it great? It's so "real"...
                         
                          RICK
           Real stupid.
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Let's go. This place is dead.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           There are no weirdos here.
                         
          Startled, they turn to see ELIJAH C. SKUGGS, a twisted,
          haggard old man. He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone
          which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino
          cherry on top. Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary
          eyes. We now realize the giant head is molded in his image.
           17.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares,
           definitely. Children of Hell and
           twisted masses of living, breathing
           tormented flesh, certainly. But as
           for weirdos... not a one. Unless
           of course you count me! Ha ha ha!
                         
                          RICK
           Nah, you seem like a regular
           dumbshit old redneck to me.
                         
          Elijah ignores him. Julie shoots him a look and smiles at
          Elijah.
                         
                          JULIE
           I'm Julie. And you are...
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor
           of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and
           Mutant Emporium. But you knew
           that. After all, you've ventured
           miles away from civilization,
           hospitals, telephones,
                          (TO RICK)
           police... How may I help-you?
                         
                          RICK
           Drop dead.
                         
          Elijah smiles, unfazed. Julie glares at Rick. She smiles
          apologetically at Elijah.
                         
                          JULIE
           We'd like to see your freak show.
           You see, only by appreciating the
           variety and innovation of nature
           can we come to respect the fragile
           complexity of our global eco-
           system.
                         
          Elijah nudges Ernie.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           And you come to me looking for
           weirdos?
                         
          Ernie shrugs. He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate
          bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey! What the--
                         
          He looks behind him, and there--about ten feet away--is...
           18.
                         
                         
          A HULKING BALD MAN
                         
          warts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily.
          This is TOAD.
                         
          Julie and Rick turn and see him.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (REPULSED)
           Eeuuuwww...
           (composes herself and
                          WAVES)
           Ahem. Hello.
                         
          Toad doesn't respond to her waves.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As
           for the show, I'm afraid the next
           parade of deformity isn't until
           tomorrow night...
                         
          Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed. They turn to
          leave. Julie's sincerely upset.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, just our luck...
                         
          Elijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           However! I do have a private
           exhibit in my shed you might enjoy.
           I don't usually share it with the
           general public...
                         
                          RICK
           We're deeply honored. But no
           thanks.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Yeah. We really must be--
                         
          He raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! He turns
          to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily.
          Hmmm. Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed.
                         
                          JULIE
           The sideshow tradition has been
           misrepresented by the media. You
           don't traffic in human misery. You
           show society the part of itself it
           doesn't want to look at.
           19.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Yes... Yesm I see...
                         
          He looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says
          "Where'd you find this nutty chick?"
                         
          Rick shrugs and follows, taking Ernie with him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           What the heck. We'll see some
           pickled dog brains, maybe some
           pictures of women with, you know,
           added equipment.
                         
                          RICK
           And to think we could be in the
           limo with those stewardesses.
                         
          Elijah holds the shed door open for them. It's pitch black
          inside. Julie enters. Rick and Ernie follow.
                         
                          ERNIE
           What the hell, Coog, these people
           are weird, but they seem nice
           enough.
                         
          A CUTE BUNNY
                         
          sits outside the shed. THWAP! Toad lashes out with his ten
          foot tongue, and sucks the bunny into his mouth. He shuffles
          into the shed, crunching contentedly.
                         
          Elijah closes the shed doors in our face, grinning. we hear
          a lonq peal of EVIL LAUGHTER from inside.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HE-HE-HE! HA-
           HAHA! HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA! AH-HA-HA-
           HEHA! YAH-HA-HA-HA-HEE-HEE-HO-HA-
           HE-HE!
                         
                         
          INT. SHED
                         
          It's dark and spooky. Elijah stands in a pool of light,
          reading a Family Circus cartoon in the funny pages.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           HA-HE-HE-HE! God I love the Family
           Circus! How do they do it day
           after day? It's amazing.
                         
          He turns to...
                         
          RICK, JULIE, AND.ERNIE
           20.
                         
                         
          as Toad finishes strapping them onto massive Frankenstein-
          style operating tables. They struggle desperately against
                         THE STRAPS
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO ELIJAH)
           ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Well, I guess they do use the same
           joke over and over. I'm just a
           sucker for that little moffet's
           shenanigans, that's all.
           (he tosses the funnies
                          ASIDE)
           But perhaps I should tell you a
           little more about what I do. You
           see, I not only exhibit freaks, I
           make them. Just like Michelangelo
           saw the angel in the stone, I look
           at a guy like Kevin Costner and see
           a giant peach grub who can fart the
           Blue Danube!
           (mops brow, asks
                          OFFHANDEDLY)
           Am I crazy or is it hot in here?
                         
          Rick, Julie, and Ernie shoot him a look that pretty well
          answers his question. Elijah shrugs and goes back to his
          spiel.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Behold! The Tasty Freekz machine!
                         
          He pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine. Several
          drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude
          network of pipes, gadgets and computers into an old Tasty
          Freeze soft serve ice cream machine (The logo has been
          changed to "Tasty Freekz"). The biggest vat reads "NOXON
          24."
                         
                          JULIE
           My God! He's using Noxon Twenty-
           Four!
                         
                          RICK
           Hey! You're not supposed to have
           that stuff!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Oh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed
           to have these either!
           21.
                         
                         
          He holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with
          the "Ramada Inn" logo. Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp. He
          tosses the towels.
                         
          As Elijah gets worked up into a frenzy, the ambience in the
          room becomes more and more horrific: the sunlight is replaced
          by an eerie green glow, a thunderstorm rumbles to life, a
          raven perches on the windowsill, a rat scurries across the
          floor, one of those plastic "Bony Banks" reaches out and
          grabs a quarter...
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I need only punch a few buttons on
           this magnificent device, and it
           gives me an easy-to-apply ointment
           that will mutate a perfect young
           body, bubble its skin, warp its
           bones and twist its guts into AN
           UNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE, STOMACH-
           TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN!
                         
          Elijah's hair is now standing on end. He's foaming at the
          mouth. A bolt of lightning and THUNDERCLAP cap the
          monologue.
                         
                          JULIE
           Wait a minute. Does this mean
           we're not going to see a show?
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (IGNORES HER)
           Toad, fire up that machine, and
           let's turn these hapless asswipes
           into monstrosities!
                         
           RICK, JULIE, ERNIE
                          (TOGETHER)
           AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Now let's see. Who wants to get
           freaked first?
                         
                          ERNIE
           (points at Julie)
           Ladies first!
                         
                          JULIE
           Go screw yourself!
                         
                          ERNIE
           If I were you, I would!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Hmmmm.
           22.
                         
                         
          Toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine. Elijah steps
          past him to a jerry-rigged computer console. He punches some
          keys and some rotating DNA models appear on the monitor.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (mumbling to himself)
           It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC...
           two birds with one stone... Yeah,
           it's pretty darn good, really...
                         
          He presses "enter" and the computer beeps. He smiles.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Let 'er rip, Toad!
                         
          Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life.
          Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish
          with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes,
          exposing their sides, and pushes them close together.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Wait a second. You're really gonna
           smear that stuff on us and mutate
           our body parts!?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Correct.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Well... then could you give me a
           really big rodney?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I'm a mad scientist pal, not a
           miracle worker.
                         
          Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their
          skin begins to bubble and undulate.
                         
                          JULIE/ERNIE
           Oh God!... No!... Holy shit!
                          (ETC)
                         
          A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another
          on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized
          dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and
          melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin
          continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up under
                         THE SKIN:
                         
          Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore...
                         
          The Pepsi logo--"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation"...
          Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which
          then takes the form of...
           23.
                         
                         
          Demon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY. Gumby's
          got his back to camera. He's grabbing his crotch and
          flipping everyone off.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Gumby! Put that thing away!
                         
          Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into...
                         
                         JULIE/ERNIE
                         
          joined side to side, their two heads on a single body which
          is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah
          wheels a large mirror in front of them.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Feast your eyes!
                         
                          JULIE
           NOOOOO!
                         
                          ERNIE
           Well, at least I'll never have to
           go far for a piece of tail.
                         
                          JULIE
           Pig!
                         
          She SMACKS him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Ouch! I was just trying to keep
           things light. Oh God! Why me!?
                         
          He starts blubbering uncontrollably. Toad drags them towards
          the door.
                         
                          JULIE
           Mother always said there'd be days
           like this. And I thought she was
           nuts!
                         
          They exit. Elijah turns to Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (gestures to Julie/Ernie)
           A mere party trick. But you,
           you're gonna be special.
                         
          Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching
          keys.
                         
                          RICK
                          (GETS TOUGH)
           Let me go, Skuggs, or else!
                          (MORE)
           24.
                         
           I got some RICK(cont'd)
           friends that'll come
           down here and mess you up bad,
           homey!
           (Elijah chuckles. Rick
           tries a different
                          APPROACH)
           I got some other friends who can
           score you box seats at the
           Superbowl, no problem.
                          (ANOTHER FAILURE)
           YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF,
           YOU FUCKIN' APE?!
           (switches gears again)
           You ever had a hot fudge bath with
           Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna]
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (LOOKS UP--INTERESTED)
           You know her?
                         
          Rick nods hopefully. Elijah considers it for a moment, then
          frowns.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Ah, screw it. I'd never get
           anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP
           THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE!
                         
          Toad starts the machine. Elijah pulls the lever and
          dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment. He carries it
          towards Rick, leering maniacally.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           For years I've strived to create
           the ultimate monster. The first of
           a whole new generation of
           superfreaks! Now I've finally got
           you, the perfect subject--a real
           asshole! HA-HA-
           (he pauses and looks
           closer at Rick)
           Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy
           from "Hey Dude Three-The
           Beguiling?"
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, that's me!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           You were great in that picture! Oh
           well, I guess for the next one
           they'll have to get Christian
           Slater! HA-HA-HA!
           25.
                         
                         
          Elijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. THE LAB - NIGHT
                         
          The barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big
          green moon. A huge ball of flame belches out of the smoke
          stack.
                         
           RICK (O.S.)
           AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG!
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. THE LAB - MORNING
                         
          It's eerily quiet in the dawn light.
                         
                         
          INT. LAB
                         
          Extreme close-up of Rick's eye as it opens, and searches the
          room frantically. Close-up of Rick's hand--a normal hand--
          straining at the bonds.
                         
          RICK's POV groggily searches the lab, and picks up the
          blurred image of Elijah in the distance. He's on the phone,
          speaking in hushed tones.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           This is Red Swan. May I speak to
           the Laughing Man?... Yes, I'll
           hold.
                         
          For a moment, Elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune
          of "Freak Out," by Chic. A man's laughing voice comes on the
          other end of the line. It laughs throughout the
          "conversation".
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Laughing Man? Red Swan. I've done
           it! I found the perfect subject--
           huge ego, shallow personality,
           almost no moral values... A
           lawyer? No, better. An actor.
           Yeah, the guy from those hilarious
           "Hey Dude" movies! Hahahaha--
                         
          Laughing man has stopped laughing. Elijah dummies up.
           26.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (SHEEPISHLY)
           Well, I liked 'em.
                         
          Laughing man resumes laughing. Elijah listens intently.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           Right... Yes... Yes, I see...
           But that's just it. He's not
           quite, uh, finished. I need more
           Noxon so I can--
                         
          Laughing Man laughs so loudly Elijah has to hold the phone
          away.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (ASIDE)
           Geez, what a grouch.
                         
          Over on the slab, Rick groans. He's waking up. Elijah
          notices.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (to Laughing man)
           Laughing Man? I have to go. What
           about the Noxon? Two days? Great,
           you can see everything then...
           Yeah, you take it easy too.
                         
          Elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Wakey, wakey. Time to meet and
           greet the new you.
                         
                          RICK
           Huh?
                         
          He flips the slab right-side up, and holds up a mirror.
          Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new
          form. Rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous,
          bug-eyed monster!
                         
                          RICK
           AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. LAB - MORNING
                         
          BANG! The doors fly open. Elijah drags Rick out.
          Horrified, Rick clutches the monster side of his face.
           27.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Oh God! This was my good side!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Still is if you ask me! Hell, even
           half-done, you'll be the star of
           the show tonight.
                         
          Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           Welcome to your spacious
           accommodations.
                         
          He unlocks the door and drags Rick in.
                         
                         
          INT. OUTHOUSE
                         
          Oddly, the interior is a vast barracks, fifty feet long and
          thirty feet high. Rick looks around.
                         
                          RICK
                          (IMPRESSED)
           Great use of the space.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I learned it all from Bob Vila.
                         
          BOB VILA walks up next to Elijah.
                         
                          BOB
           You know you could expose those
           rustic beams and put in a skylight
           over one weekend, Elijah.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Give it a rest, Bob!
                         
          He pushes Bob away into the freak house, gives Rick a goodbye
          wink and walks out the door.
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTHOUSE
                         
          Elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           One of these days I gotta put a
           shitter in there.
                         
          Bob Vila steps out of nowhere again, holding a Time-Life
          book.
           28.
                         
                         
                          BOB
           No problem. It's all here in my
           Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah.
           And you pay nothing for thirt--
                         
          BONK! Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer
          from his tool belt.
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          It takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim
          light. There's nobody in sight. The walls are lined with
          dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like
          prison cells. Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way
          forward.
                         
                          RICK

           Are you alright?
                         
          Rick sees the vague outline of JulieErnie a few yards away.
                         
                          RICK
           I know that voice. That's the
           voice that said,
                          (MIMICS)
           "Cool, a freak show. Let's check
           it out!"
                         
                          JULIE
           What!? Oh sure, blame the woman.
           Typical.
                         
                          RICK
                          (MIMICS)
           "It's so real." Is this real
           enough for you? I'm friggin'
           Quasimodo!
                         
                          ERNIE
           Chill out, Coog. You're talking to
           the original tag team of ugly
           pukes. Step into the light.
                         
                          RICK
           Okay, here I come.
           29.
                         
                         
          Rick steps forward into a pool of light. Julie and Ernie are
          caught by surprise. Julie struggles to keep her composure.
          Ernie's repulsed.
                         
                          ERNIE
           ULP!
                         
          Ernie turns away and pukes on the floor. Julie soldiers on.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh geez... It's not so (GULP)
           revolting. After all, physical
           beauty is just a socially-enforced
           myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI
                         
          Julie turns away and pukes on the floor.
                         
                          RICK
                          (OFFENDED)
           Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas
           yourself. You're lucky I've got a
           strong stomach!
                         
           VOICE (O.C.)
           And you're lucky I don't BITE you!
           Heh heh heh heh ...
                         
          Rick wheels around to see JUAN THE DOG BOY, snickering behind
          him. Juan is a hairy young Mexican with a snout, dog ears,
          and canine teeth--Scrappy Doo with an attitude.
                         
          Rick assumes a threatening pose.
                         
                          RICK
           Get away from me you, you...
                         
                          JUAN
           Freak? Ha ha hahahaha!
           (he stares hard at Rick)
           I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of
           the freaks.
                         
                          JULIE
           (walks up to them)
           Kind of the "top dog."
                         
          Juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg.
                         
                          JUAN
           Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake?
                         
          He extends a hand to Rick. Rick doesn't take it. He hears a
          slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles, and
          turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House.
           30.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           No thanks. I don't plan on staying
           long. How many of you are there in
           here anyway?
                         
          Juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in Rick's
          face.
                         
                          JUAN
           First, I have a question for you,
           Ricardo. Who starred in the film
           "International Velvet?"
                         
                          RICK
           Huh?
                         
                          JUAN
           Well, perhaps we should ask the
           Worm!
                         
          The top right cubicle lights up, revealing the WORM. He is a
          man with no arms and legs, and the wrinkly, slimy body of a
          worm. His face is learned-looking, with spectacles, a small
          goatee, and a pipe which he puffs on pompously.
                         
                          JUAN
           Tell us, Worm, who starred in
           "International Velvet?"
                         
          He puffs pensively on his pipe for a second.
                         
                          THE WORM
           Yes, yes ... very interesting...
           International Velvet... The
           perfectly appalling sequel to
           National Velvet, I believe. No
           dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever.
                         
                          JUAN
           Yes, Worm. But who was the star?
                         
          The worm takes a long, thoughtful drag on his pipe...
                         
                          WORM
           Olivia DeHavilland.
                         
                          JUAN
           Olivia DeHavilland... Rick, do you
           agree or disagree?
                         
                          RICK
           This is nuts. This is crazy...
           Besides, it was Tatum O'Neill.
           31.
                         
                         
                          JUAN
           Very good. It was Tatum O'Neill,
           now married to tennis star John
           McEnroe. Circle gets the square.
                         
          The lights come on in 9 of the center cubicles, silhouetting
          9 freaks in a full size HOLLYWOOD SQUARES 3 x 3 layout. The
          FREAKS applaud Rick's success. He's incredulous.
                         
                          OTHER FREAKS
           Yayyy!
                         
          Worm nudges an "0" into place in his cubicle, with some
          difficulty. He's not happy about being proved wrong.
                         
                          WORM
           Blast. O'Neill ... No talent
           ragamuffin...
                         
                          JUAN
           okay, JulieErnie, your turn. Who's
           it going to be?
                         
          As Juan names the freaks one by one, their square is
          highlighted, and they wave at Rick cheerily.
                         
                          JUAN (CONT'D)
           Nosey the Nose Man!
                         
          NOSEY is a man whose massive nose dominates his head. He
          blows into a huge hanky, and waves it wearily at Rick.
                         
                          JUAN (CONTD)
           Cowboy!
                         
          COWBOY is a young boy with cow-like features, a cowboy hat,
          cowboy clothes, and a full set of udders.
                         
                          JUAN (CONT-D)
           The Bearded Lady!
                         
          The BEARDED LADY is a big, tough, bearded man--in a blouse.
          He has lipstick, earrings, and tattoos on his muscular arms.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           (gruff and masculine)
           How ya' doin.
                         
                          JUAN
           Sockhead!
                         
          SOCKHEAD is a freak with a large button-eyed sock puppet for
          a head. He's munching cookies which ,spill uselessly out of
          his throatless sock mouth...
           32.
                         
                         
                          JUAN
           The Human Torch!
                         
          The HUMAN TORCH is a man engulfed in flames. He waves
          apathetically.
                         
                          JUAN
           Rosie the Pinhead!
                         
          ROSIE is a pinhead in dark sunglasses. She has a great bod
          jammed into a sexy dress. She smokes a cigarette demurely,
          and waves a small, arrogant big-star wave.
                         
                          JUAN
           The hideous Frog Man!
                         
          Frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit. He strikes a
          threatening "monster" pose, then gives a friendly wave.
                         
                          JUAN
           And of course, in the center
           square, Mr. Paul Lynde!
                         
          Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights
          with plenty of dark shadows. There's a horrific MUSIC STING
          and we ZOOM IN to a DECOMPOSING SKELETON in the center
          cubicle. Its eyeball drips out of the socket.
                         
                          JUAN
           Well JulieErnie, who will it be?
                         
                          ERNIE
           Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go
           with Paul Lynde.
                         
                          JULIE
           Don't be an idiot.
                         
          They argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3
          Stooges style. Juan turns to Rick.
                         
                          JUAN
           You see, Rick? Just because we're
           freaks doesn't mean we can't have
           some fun, huh?
                         
          Rick is overwhelmed by it all. He backs away.
                         
                          RICK
           Get away from me. Get away! I'm
           not like you. You hear me? I'm
           Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK!
           33.
                         
                         
          The Freaks laugh in Rick's face. He storms off.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          ANOTHER AREA OF THE FREAK HOUSE--A LITTLE LATER
                         
          Rick sits in a corner, pondering his fate. Oddly, there's a
          shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak
          House. JulieErnie approach him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Okay Coog, so I get twenty four
           hour access to T `n' A, and you
           look like a plate of rancid
           giblets. We're still pals, right?
                         
          Rick shoots him a look.
                         
                          JULIE
           All the freaks have gone through
           this anguish, Rick. At first, I
           was blinded by my anger. I admit
           it. I wanted to break your neck
           for getting me into this. But I
           got over it. Juan taught me to
           channel my anger for the common
           good.
                         
                          RICK
           It was your fault, anyway. You
           wanted to see the freak show.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (FURIOUS)
           I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!
                         
          She tries to wring his neck. Ernie helps. Rick glares at
          Ernie.
                         
                          RICK
           Ernie!
                         
                          ERNIE
           Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second
           there, I was a total man-hater.
           Weird.
                         
          Julie regains her cool. She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles
          something on it, and hands it to Rick.
                         
                          JULIE
           Here. Take it.
                         
          Rick examines the cover. He reads it aloud.
           34.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           "So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak--
           Now What?"
                         
          There's an "8" scribbled on the pamphlet.
                         
                          JULIE
           we're in cubicle eight. Maybe
           later you'll be ready to talk.
                         
                          RICK
           Forget it. Not me. I'm not like
           those other god-forsaken animals.
                         
          He throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm,
          Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach. They sit down in a
          circle around him. The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and
          puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.
                         
                          WORM
           You're mistaken, Rick. You are
           exactly like us. We were all
           normal healthy folk before we made
           the fateful mistake of visiting
           this hell hole at an off hour.
           Why, when I first came here...

          EXT. FREAK COMPOUND - THE PAST
                         
          The Worm, as an OXFORD PROFESSOR, is wandering around the
          grounds, taking notes and puffing on his pipe.
                         
           WORM (V.O.)
           I was a professor of lacrophylogy--
           er, the study of worms, of course.
           I came in search of the
           Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman
           terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr.
           Skuggs said he had just such a worm
           in his shed. How could I have
           surmised that the specimen and I
           would ultimately prove to be one
           and the same?
                         
          We see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the
          lab. The smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear
          his off-camera screams. DISSOLVE back to..
                         
          THE FREAK HOUSE--NOW
                         
          The Worm finishes his tale.
           35.
                         
                         
                          WORM
           At first, the transformation was
           fabulous. I truly understood the
           worm's ethos like never before.
           But those early days of fascination
           are over. Now, in retrospect, I
           think the whole thing is a fucking
           headache. I'd sell my soul just to
           be able to wipe my own ass...
                         
          He sniffles a little, but manages to hold back the tears. We
          pan to Sockhead.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           I first came here as a tourist,
           looking for some fun...

          A lanky TOURIST, obviously Sockhead in better days. He
          approaches Elijah.
                         
           SOCKHEAD (V.O.)
           Anyway, then Elijah turned me into
           a sock. That's it.

          Sockhead shrugs apologetically.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           Sorry. I'm not much for stories.
                         
          The camera moves in on the BEARDED LADY.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           When I arrived here, I was nothing
           like I am now.

          The bearded lady (as a man) steps out of the cab of his
          eighteen-wheeler. He looks very much like he does now,
          except he has no lipstick or earrings.
           36.
                         
                         
           BEARDED LADY (V.O.)

           contradiction, so full of
           questions.

          He finishes his story.
                         
           BEARDED LADY/MAN
           Now I know who I am. I can say,
           "Hey world. This is me. I'm a
           woman. And I like me."
                         
          The others look at the bearded man uneasily. The camera pans
          past the Bearded Lady, and moves in on an ordinary HAMMER
          lying on the ground.

          Happy music. The hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly
          STOCKBOY. The music turns tense as Elijah appears and scans
          the shelf. He makes eye contact with the hammer, and smiles.
          He grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag.

          The bag opens, Elijah reaches in and takes out the hammer.
          The music turns to Psycho-like string stabs as Elijah uses
          the hammer to smash in a nail.

          Everyone looks at the hammer sympathetically. Rick turns
          away to wipe a tear from his eye.
                         
                          WORM
           You are one of us now, Rick.
           Whether you admit it or not. It's
           irrefutable.
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah. Says you.
                         
          The worm shakes his head. The freaks turn and head back to
          their cubicles. Rick exchanges a look with Julie before she
          and Ernie turn and head off.
           37.
                         
                         
          Rick is left alone, staring pensively at the hammer.

           You're right.
                         
          He spots the pamphlet on the ground, picks it up, dusts it
          off. He opens it and begins to read, under the heading "1.
          It's Fun Being Ugly!"...
                         
          Rick closes the pamphlet, looks at the number "8" Julie
          scribbled, and nods with a sense of purpose. Standing up, he
          throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck, and walks
          towards the cubicles.

          Rick walks past the cubicles. In one, the Bearded Lady knits
          a sweater... He reaches cubicle 8, and is about to speak
          when he hears Julie giggling. There is a man's voice, but
          not Ernie's. It's Juan.
                         
          Rick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juan's belly. He
          licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight. Ernie
          is reading "The Woman's Room," trying not to notice all of
          this.
                         
          Rick watches, disgusted. He tears up the pamphlet, throws it
          to the ground, and storms off to find his own cubicle.
                         
          Ernie peeks at Julie and Juan continuing their foreplay.
          Juan stops abruptly.
                         
                          JUAN
           Hey. Mind your business.

          Ernie returns to his book. The camera PANS up to Rick's
          cubicle. He's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a
          log with his knife-like talon. He talks to himself, making
          sure to be loud enough for JulieErnie and Juan to hear.
                         
                          RICK
           Well that EES guy should rescue me
           any minute. Then it's straight to
           the plastic surgeon and back to
           sunny old L.A. I wonder how many
           of my beautiful, anatomically
           correct girlfriends will be waiting
           for me.

           Thanks, Stuey.
                         
          Rick looks up and sees a holographic image of Stuey Gluck
          floating in the air above him.
                         
                          RICK
           AHH! A phantom troll!
                         
          He swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps
          darting around, dodging the blows. Cowboy leans around the
          cubicle wall. He talks a lot like Gomer Pyle.

           No.
                         
          Rick stops swinging, lamely pretends he was stretching, and
          ignores Stuey, who hovers around him.
                         
                          COWBOY
           Sounds to me like you've developed
           a telepathic bond. Don't mean yer
           nuts or nuthin'. Heck, old Nosey,
           why he can smell the future. Lots
           of us freaks got E.S.P. And

           Shucks, Rick, you're lucky.
           Telepathy like yours only occurs
           between real soulmates. A bond
           like that should be cherished.
                         
          Cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle.

          and fade away.

           That's me!
                         
          Suddenly two GOONS in dark suits snatch the paper away from
          Stuey. They grab him and force him into a limousine.
                         
                         
          INT. LIMOUSINE
                         
          The Goons hold Stuey in between them.'He's terrified. we
          hear the low, menacing chuckle of the Laughing Man, who's off
          screen. The camera is his POV.
                         
                          LAUGHING MAN

                          STUEY
           No. You've got it all wrong. I
           don't know anything about that.
           You gotta believe me.
                         
                          LAUGHING MAN

          cruises off down the street. We hear a POWER DRILL, Stuey's
          SCREAMS, and Laughing Man's hearty CACKLE from inside.

          INT. RICK'S CUBICLE - NIGHT
                         
          Rick has whittled his log down to a toothpick. He admires
          it, then leans over and fits it into an intricate three-foot
          scale model of the Eiffel Tower, made entirely out of
          toothpicks. The Human Torch walks by.
                         
                          HUMAN TORCH
           Wow, what a great model!
           (he points at a toothpick)
           But look, this one's crooked.
                         
          He reaches out to fix it and--WOOF! The whole model burns to
          a cinder. Rick looks at him hatefully.
                         
                          HUMAN TORCH

           Sorry.
                         
          Elijah steps into the freakhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Alright, freaks! Get ready for the
           glamour! Get ready for the glitz!
           Get ready to be pelted with rotten
           vegetables, 'cause it's showtime!

          EXT. CARNIVAL TENT
                         
          Elijah, looking natty in his Ringmaster suit, stands at the
          entrance, barking to various people who are drifting in.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           It's grisly! It's revolting! It'll
           make you wish you were dead! And
           at just twelve bucks a head, you
           can bring all the kids!
                         
          We follow a KINDLY FATHER through the curtained entrance.
          OOF! He collapses, a knife embedded in his chest, revealing
          the total mayhem...
                         
          INSIDE THE TENT
                         
          The motley crowd (LOCALS, sleazy looking MOBSTERS, rogue
          BIKERS, wayward HIPPIES, and JAPANESE TOURISTS, etc.) is
          brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time.
                         
          Some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up
          around the sides of the tent. There's a "PETTING ZOO" where
          a KID is petting a two-tailed-no-headed dog. And there's a
          "HEAVY PETTING ZOO" where a GUY is french kissing a six-
          legged goat.
                         
          A CLOWN sits in a dunk tank, heckling the customers. The
          sign says "DUNK ME IN ACID!"
                         
                          CLOWN
           C'mon, my granny could throw better
           than you!
                         
          He's talking to an OLD LADY, who throws a baseball, hits the
          target, and dunks the clown into the foaming bath of carbolic
          acid. We hear his gurgling screams, then his bony hand
          reaches up out of the bath.
                         
          Elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience.
          It's total mayhem.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (CALMLY)
           Quiet, please.
                         
          Everyone instantly sits down, shuts up, and looks up
          obediently at Elijah.
           43.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
           you are about to witness a
           cavalcade of atrocities so
           horrific, I advise the more
           sensitive members of our audience
           to leave the premises.
                         
          Two SENSITIVE LOOKING MEN wearing sweaters draped over their
          shoulders politely get up and leave.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Tonight I'm proud to announce the
           addition of several new
           monstrosities to the show,
           including our star attraction, the
           Beast Boy--an untamed and highly
           dangerous ghoul who's liable to go
           nuts and kill us all at the drop of
           a hat.
           (impressed "oohs", "ahhs",
           and "cools" from the
                          AUDIENCE)
           But first up, prepare to behold an
           unspeakably repulsive yet
           heartwarming atrocity, Three Men
           and a Baby!
                         
          THREE MEN AND A BABY, all fused into a single multi-limbed
          freak, walks out onstage. One of its arms holds up a dirty
          diaper, and all the three men hold their noses and grimace.
          The audience breaks into warm-hearted laughter and applause.
                         
                         BACKSTAGE
                         
          The freaks mill around in the caged-in green room, guarded by
          Toad. Frogman, dressed in a magician's outfit over his
          wetsuit, holds an empty dove cage and searches the room,
          whistling for his missing dove. Nosey sneezes up a cloud of
          feathers. JulieErnie walk determinedly towards the adjacent
          Men's and Women's restrooms... BONK! They hit the wall
          between the two doors.
                         
          Rick is reading his "script", rehearsing his lines. He's
          wearing a cheesy "jungle" costume.
                         
                          RICK
           Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will
           eat you. Arrrghh.
           (he throws down the
                          SCRIPT)
           I can't do this shit!
                         
          He peers through the bars, scanning the audience for signs.of
          a rescue party.
           44.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Damn it! What's keeping those
           guys?
                         
          The Worm creeps up behind Rick.
                         
                          WORM
           Something's troubling you, my boy.
           what is it?
                         
                          RICK
           Well, let's see. I've been
           kidnapped, hideously disfigured,
           imprisoned with a bunch of mutant
           freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A.,
           and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude
           Three" read like "Dr. Zhivago."
                         
                          WORM
           I think I know what you're going
           through. I too had an eating
           disorder. You see, I've always had
           a feverish obsession with pudding.
           And when I was a young lad...
                         
          Rick groans and looks out at the audience.

           And now a perennial favorite here
           at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen.
           I know you'll all enjoy the musical
           stylings of Rosie the Pinhead.
                         
          Rosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding
          a microphone. After the applause dies down, she whips off
          her sunglasses with a flourish, revealing her extremely goofy-
          looking crossed eyes. She wails incomprehensibly and bonks
          her head with the mic.

          A series of WIPES show bits of various acts as the evening
                         WEARS ON:
                         
                         ERNIE/JULIE
                         
          are doing a Vaudeville style stand-up routine while tap
          dancing.
           45.
                         
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey Julie, how many feminists does
           it take to screw in a light bulb?
                         
                          JULIE
           How many?
                         
                          ERNIE
           Two. One to screw it in and one to
           ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha!
                         
                          JULIE
           Oaf!
                         
          She bonks him with their cane. He bonks her back. She
          knocks him cold. They both fall down.
                         
          THE BEARDED LADY
                         
          is doing a make-over demonstration. He's got a local GIRL
          from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           If your coloring is in the autumn
           range, like Maria's, try an earth
           tone eye makeup. Now I've done a
           lovely French braid on Maria, but I
           encourage everyone to experiment
           and use your imagination. The main
           thing is to just have fun with it.
                         
          The audience is engrossed. Some take notes.
                         
                         SOCKHEAD
                         
          is ringing those "tuned bells" and singing along.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           Edelweiss, Edelweiss.
                         
          He takes a bow but his sock is snagged on the mic stand. It
          pulls off and reveals a normal-sized hand where the sockhead
          was--he's actually a hand-head! The audience gasps. A MAN
          gets up and points accusingly.
                         
                          MAN
           He's got a hand under there!
                         
                          SOMEONE ELSE
           It's a hoax!
                         
          Sockhead realizes he's unveiled and tries to hide his hand-
          head with his other hands. The crowd starts jeering and
          pelting Sockhead with rotten vegetables. He gives them the
          finger with all three hands. Elijah tries to calm them.
           46.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Puppetteering is an admirable skill
           in its own right! Give him his
           due!
                         
                          THE CROWD
           Where's the beast boy you promised
           us!? Bring on the beast boy! We
           want the beast boy! (etc.)
                         
                         BACKSTAGE
                         
          The Worm is still talking to Rick. We can hear the crowd
          screaming for him in the background.
                         
                          WORM
           And when I won first prize, they
           never called me pudding-head again.
                         
                          RICK
           So?
                         
                          WORM
           Don't you see? You must turn your
           hardship into inspiration! You're
           an actor, Rick! Your body is your
           instrument, and with it you must
           play your tragic symphony for all
           the world!
                         
          Rick is really moved. Elijah pokes his head backstage.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (TO RICK)
           They're going nuts for you, Beast
           Boy! You better go out there now!
                         
          He starts to take off his jungle costume.
                         
                          RICK
           (determined, inspired)
           I'll be right there.
                          (TO WORM)
           Thank you Worm. I don't really
           know how I can repay you for this.
                         
                          WORM
                          (SINCERE)
           You could wipe my ass.
                         
                          RICK
           (thinks Worm is joking)
           Ha-ha! Always the wit, eh Worm?
           47.
                         
                         
          Rick claps him on the back and walks off. Worm is
          disappointed.
                         
                          WORM
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Damn.
           (he turns to Nosey)
           Nosey, have I ever told you what a
           gifted artist you are?
                         
          Nosey gives him a worried look.
                         
                         ONSTAGE
                         
          The spotlight reveals Rick, centerstage, poised in
          Shakespearean garb. The crowd quiets down and focuses on
          Rick with great respect and awe. A truly dramatic silence.
          Rick pauses for effect and then launches into a soliloquy
          with bravura.
                         
                          RICK
           Now is the winter of our
           discontent,
           Made glorious summer by this son of
           York,
           But I that am not shaped for
           sportive tricks,
           Nor made to court an amorous
           looking glass,
           I, that am curtailed of this fair
           proportion,
           Cheated of feature by dissembling
           nature,
                         
          The audience is riveted. Even Spanish-speaking peasants are
          mouthing the words. Elijah, however, thumbs through his
          script, totally confused. The freaks watch through the bars
          from the wings--completely engrossed, especially Julie. Juan
          notices this and pulls her closer to him, but she pushes him
          away.
                         
          We move in on an erudite British gentlemen in the crowd. By
          God! It's ALISTAIR COOKE! He turns to camera. Subtitle:

           If you're having trouble
           understanding Mr. Coogan's
           brilliant reading of this soliloquy
           from Richard the Third, please take
           advantage of the handy subtitles
           for the culturally illiterate.
           48.
                         
                         
          A FILTHY PEASANT sitting next to Cooke is trying to listen to
          Rick. He turns angrily to Cooke.
                         
                          FILTHY PEASANT
           SHHH!
                         
          Cooke turns back to the stage. The words in brackets appear
          as SUBTITLES.
                         
                          RICK
           Deformed, unfinished, sent before
           my time,
                          {I'M UGLY}
           Into this breathing world, scarse
           half made up,
           {I'M REALLY UGLY}
           And that so lamely and
           unfashionable, That dogs bark at me
           as I halt by them.
           {I'M F KIN' BUTT-UGLY, ALRIGHT!?}
           Why I, in this weak piping time of
           peace,
           {BLAH, BLAH, BLAH}
           Have no delight to pass away the
           time,
           {I NEVER GET LAID...}
           Unless to see my shadow in the sun,
           And descant on mine own deformity!
           {BECAUSE I'M UGLY}
                         
          Rick bows. The crowd bursts into applause. They yell
          "Bravo" and throw bouquets. Rick takes several curtain
          calls. The freaks cheer for him. Julie is particularly
          moved--she and Rick exchange a heavy look, laden with
          romantic potential. NOTE: We will insert an almost
          subliminal one-frame shot of the Pepsi logo at this
          triumphant moment.
                         
          Kevin, the EES executive from the airport scene, walks into
          the tent. Rick sees him and gasps with joy. He leaps off
          the stage, runs up to Kevin and hugs him. Kevin is shocked,
          of course. Overcome by the moment, Rick regresses to his old
          self.
                         
                          RICK
           I'm saved! Haha! You sorry
           mutants are gonna rot in this hole
           while I'm sipping mint juleps by
           the pool!
           {AS FORTUNE SMILES O'ER MY FATE, SO
           DESTINY SPURNS YOUR ACCURSE'D PATE}
                         
          The freaks and the audience gasp at Rick's cruelty. Julie is
          shocked--Juan gives her an "I told you so" look. Rick sees
          Julie and catches himself.
           49.
                         
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO KEVIN)
           I mean, um, I hope you have room
           for all my friends, heh-heh.
                         
                          KEVIN
           Rick, Rick, listen, I really love
           this new look you've come up with.
           But just between you and me, I
           don't think the guys upstairs would
           really get it.
                         
                          RICK
           What are you saying!?
                         
                          KEVIN
                          (CHUCKLES SNIDELY)
           I'm saying you're ugly enough to
           burn the nosehairs off a dead nun.
                         
          The crowd bursts into cruel hysterics, pointing mockingly at
          Rick. Even Alistair Cooke is practically choking with
          laughter.
                         
                          ALISTAIR COOKE
           AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ!
                         
          Rick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering
          faces. He begins to tremble. Then...
                         
          RICK'S MONSTER EYE
                         
          springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage.
          His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body
          with violent intensity. He grabs Kevin's head and screams in
          a new, monstrous voice.
                         
                          RICK
           EAT SHIT!
                         
          POP! He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft.
          The head stares down at Rick in disbelief.
                         
                          KEVIN'S HEAD
           Now you're just being childish.
                         
          Rick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits.
          The crowd panics and charges for the exits.
                         
                          CROWD
           AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF
           HERE!
                         
          People are trampling over each other in the mayhem. Alistair
          Cooke is crushed under the stampede.
           50.
                         
          The freaks are horrified. Monster Rick growls triumphantly.
          Elijah looks on, intrigued.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Now that's entertainment.
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Rick awakens with a start and gets up. He approaches
          JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly
          playing a game of "Wheel of Fortune." The cubicles contain
          large blank blocks, like the "letters" on the game show. So
          far, there's a "D", two "S"s, and a "K" revealed. Rosie the
          Pinhead plays Vanna White's role.
                         
                          NOSEY
           I'd like to buy a vowel.
                         
          The Bearded lady yawns. Rick edges towards them.
                         
                          RICK
           Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?
                         
          Juan advances towards Rick, sneering.
                         
                          JUAN
           So. Now you don't mind mixing with
           us--how did you say it--sorry
           mutants?
                         
                          RICK
           Look! I'm sorry for what happened
           at the show. Can't you just forget
           it?
                         
          He shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a
          human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off,
          embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the
          silence.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about
           your big escape plan?
                         
          Juan gives Ernie a nasty "shut up" look. He growls at him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Well, excuse me for living.
                         
                          RICK
           You have an escape plan?
                         
                          JUAN
           Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a
           simple diversion.
                          (MORE)
           51.
                          JUAN(CONT'D)
           Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks
           cry out for freedom!
           Aooooooorrraaaagh!
                         
          Juan howls lustily. He looks to rest of the freaks. They're
          a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it.
                         
                          FREAKS
           Aoo...
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          JULIE
           Juan's plan is really ingenious
           Rick. See, he figured out that--
                         
                          JUAN
           I figured out that our escape does
           not include the Beast Boy. No one
           may discuss the plan with him,
           understand?
                         
          Juan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble
          agreement.
                         
                          RICK
           What's the matter with all of you?
           You trust your lives to a guy just
           'cause he can lick his own
           privates?
                         
          The freaks ponder this a second, then nod "yes".
                         
                          ERNIE
           You gotta admit, Coog, it's a
           helluva trick.
                         
                          RICK
                          (RESENTFUL)
           Fine! I'll just come up with an
           escape plan of my own then.
                         
                          JUAN
           Haha! I have spent a year studying
           this hellhole, devising the perfect
           escape. You think you'll just
           tango right out the door!? Ha!
           Just try it, amigo.
                         
                          RICK
           I will!
                         
          Rick turns to go. JulieErnie rush over and try to reason
          with him quietly.
           52.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Rick, wait.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked.
           Believe me, it ain't all it's
           cracked up to be.
                         
                          JULIE
           This isn't one of your dumb movies,
           Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a
           smart dog. I'll talk to him.
           Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't
           do it without us.
                         
                          RICK
           Forget it! I don't need you, EES,
           or anybody else! I'll get out of
           here all by myself, you... you.,.
           crud sucking pus monkeys!
                         
          DING DING DING! The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board
          light up, and ROSIE turns them over to reveal "Crud Sucking
          Pus Monkeys" as the secret phrase. Everyone claps despite
          themselves. Juan stares them down. They stop.
                         
          Rick storms off in a huff. Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes
          deep into her eyes. He kisses her passionately. Julie is
          watching Rick leave. Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her
          attention. She scratches Juan behind his ear. His leg
          instinctively kicks the air. Ernie looks worried.
                         
                          ERNIE
           I'm getting a bad feeling here.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. REAR CORNER OF FREAK HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Out of sight from the others, Rick approaches the rear door
          and tries it. It doesn't open from the inside.
                         
                          RICK
           Damn.
                         
          He peers out through a crack in the door and sees a MILKMAN
          getting out of his truck in the driveway.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO MILKMAN)
           Psst! Hey, you. Milkman!
           53.
                         
                         
                         OUTSIDE
                         
          The milkman looks over at the outhouse, suspicious.
                         
                          MILKMAN
           Yeah... ?
                         
           RICK (V.0.)
           Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a
           pal, and give me a hand will ya?
                         
                          MILKMAN
           Oooh no! I know you freaks.
           You'll try anything just to get
           someone to open that door. Well
           not me! Ha!
                         
          He's about to walk away.
                         
                          RICK
           Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk
           the world's biggest breasted woman
           all by myself. Sorry to bother
           you.
                         
          The milkman stops in his tracks. He tiptoes over to the back
          door of the outhouse, listening intently as Rick goes into
          his "act."
                         
                          RICK
           (in a lusty womanish
                          VOICE)
           Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now!
           Milk me hard!
           (Normal Rick voice)
           I've only got two hands, all right?
           Geez. I don't care if Elijah did
           give you skim milk on the right
           side, chocolate on the left, and
           eggnog in the middle.
                         
          The milkman is salivating at the door.
                         
                          MILKMAN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Gee, I love eggnog!
                         
          The milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside. Beat.
                         
                          MILKMAN
           Hey, what the--
                         
          BONK. We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his
          soft noggin. Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit
          complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing.
           54.
                         
          He looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling
          casually. He notices something. It's ...
                         
          THE GIANT ELIJAH HEAD
                         
          Its big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter
          plane in the distance behind the head, which finishes writing
          "YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY: PEPSI") Rick gets to the truck
          and tries the door. It's locked.
                         
                          RICK
           Shit.
                         
          He looks over at the giant head. The eyes are still staring
          at him--they seem to have shifted. Rick shrugs it off and
          looks around. He walks over to Elijah's car. It's locked
          too. He checks the big eyes. They've moved again.
                         
          Rick's getting a bit desperate. He sees something else and
          runs towards it. It's a dry-docked motorboat. It's locked
          too. The eyes have followed Rick again. He sees something
          else and runs over to it. It's a bag of golf clubs leaning
          against Elijah's porch. They're locked too.
                         
                          RICK
           Damn! This guy doesn't trust
           anybody!
                         
          He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only
          empty eyesockets! Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE
          behind him, spins around and faces ...
                         
          TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS
                         
          with little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and
          aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air. They aim their Uzis at
          Rick. One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big
          spliff.
                         
                          RICK
           AHHHH!
                         
          A T.V. MONITOR in Elijah's hands, shows Rick staring at us,
          the Eye's POV.
                         
                         ELIJAH
                         
          seen in extreme close-up, watches the surveillance monitor.
          He speaks into a microphone. We don't see what the room
          looks like.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Good work, Eye and Eye.
           55.
                         
                         
                         THE EYES
                         
          bob in response to Elijah. They have no mouths, but their
          pupils open and close when they speak.
                         
           EYE AND EYE
                          (JAMAICAN ACCENTS)
           Rastafari.
                         
           ELIJAH (V.0.)
           (over the walkie-talkie)
           Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh,
           den. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
                         
          Rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking
          house.
                         
                         
          INT. ELIJAH'S DEN
                         
          It's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of
          magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "National Review"
          and "Freaks Illustrated". Elijah sits in a big Barcalounger,
          smoking a pipe. Rick sits on the sofa. Toad walks up with a
          tray of soft drinks.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (TO RICK)
           Diet soda?
                         
                          RICK
           No thanks.
                         
          Elijah points to a bowl of Fiddle Faddle. Toad sits beside
          Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Fiddle Faddle?
           (Rick shakes his head)
           You sure?
                         
                          RICK
           Well, okay.
           (he scoops some into his
                          MOUTH)
           Well, are you gonna torture me or
           kill me or something?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Torture my greatest creation ever!?
           Kill the final piece of the puzzle
           that I've been putting together for
           years!? Sure, it'd be fun, but
           I've got a bigger plan, my boy.
                          (MORE)
           56.
                          ELIJAH(CONT'D)
           And when you ripped off that guy's
           head, I knew it was working like
           gangbusters!
                         
                          RICK
           But I thought I scared everyone
           away.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Uh-huh. And then they told two
           friends, and they told two friends,
           and so on, and so on. Look at
           this.
                         
          Elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on
          the table. Elijah opens one and reads it.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (READING)
           Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked
           and disgusted when my grandson told
           me about the head-popping beast at
           your show. Please send me six
           tickets.
           (he reads another)
           Dear Beast Boy, I used to like New
           Kids on The Block, but you're way
           cuter. My favorite ice cream is
           chocolate. Is it fun ripping
           people's heads off? I love you.
                          (ANOTHER LETTER)
           The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting
           spree, and Oscar is along for the
           ride!
           (he looks up at Rick)
           That one's from Pat Collins!
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, but she loves everything.
                         
          Rick reaches for the Fiddle Faddle but the bowl is empty.
          Toad BURPS.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for
           guests only! You've had enough!
                         
          Toad is blankfaced. Elijah walks over and refills the bowl.
          Rick scoops some into his mouth. Elijah walks to the
          fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker.
                         
                          RICK
           Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in
           show business all my life. The
           public does not want to see
           disgusting, depraved violent filth.
           57.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Oh, and I suppose Jake and the
           Fatman is just a fluke?
                         
          The phone rings. Elijah looks at it, and back to Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           I'll get it.
                         
          He goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           `Yello?
                         
          On the other end of the line, we hear LAUGHING MAN's insane
          chuckle. Elijah's smooth smile fades. He turns his back to-
          Rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice.
          Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Yes... Right... Tomorrow...
           Mmhmm... Mnunhmm... Wow. Okay.
           You got it... Hasta la vista to
           you too. Hahaahahaahaha--
                         
          Laughing Man hangs up on Elijah. He looks a little pissed-
          off as he turns to face Rick again. Grumbling, he takes the
          poker in hand, and pokes at the coals angrily.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Okay, Coogan. I'm finished with
           you for now.
                         
          Ricky rises and snatches the notepad just before Elijah spins
          to face him.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           But listen. I may not be "Mr.
           Tinseltown", but I damn well know
           what I like. You're gonna be a
           hideous killing machine, and that's
           final! Tomorrow night I'll finish
           the job onstage! And then, to
           demonstrate your horrible power,
           you'll slaughter all the old
           obsolete freaks in cold bl--HEY!
                         
          Elijah thrusts the red hot fire poker out and ZAP! He
          catches Toad's ten foot tongue--curled around the searing
          poker inches from the Fiddle Faddle.
                         
                          TOAD
           AAAGGGGHH!
           58.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I told you enough!
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. ELIJAH'S HOUSE DAY
                         
          Elijah shows Rick out the door. The Eyes scurry out and leap
          back into the sockets in the giant head.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Bye-bye. And remember, try another
           escape, and I'll feed your balls to
           Toad.
                         
          As he walks towards the Freak House, Rick pulls out the note
          he pocketed. A gust of wind blows it away from him. He
          chases it behind the carnival tent where...
                         
          KKCCLIINNK! He runs into ELEVEN PHONY MILKMEN, backing their
          way around the corner, each carrying their own six-pack of
          milkbottles. Startled, they turn around. Why, it's the
          freaks! And they're all dressed as milkmen! Cowboy carries
          the hammer, who's dressed in a little milkman suit as well.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           Hey Rick, I thought you were gonna
           come up with your own escape plan?
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO JUAN)
           This is your big plan? A dozen
           milkmen? Isn't that a little
           unusual?
                         
          Juan hadn't thought of this. He pushes himself forward and
          confronts Rick viciously.
                         
                          JUAN
           Twelve milkmen is theoretically
           possible. Thirteen is silly.
           Looks like one milkman too many,
           Coogan.
                         
          He pushes Rick aside. The freaks continue past him.
                         
                          RICK
           Fine then. Go ahead. Hope you
           like reggae, ya flea bitten
           bastard.
                         
          Rick watches as the Freaks approach the open courtyard, where
          he knows the Eyeballs will spot them.
           59.
                         
          Julie glances at him a second, then looks away. His mind
          made up, Rick takes a deep breath.
                         
                          RICK
           Ah, shit.
                         
          He runs over to the Freaks. He stands in Juan's way.
                         
                          RICK
           Look, you'll all be killed. You
           don't know about Elijah's giant
           Rasta eyeballs with machine guns...
           (they think he's nuts)
           It's suicide! I can't let you do
           it.
                         
                          JUAN
           And I can't let you stop us.
                         
          This is it. Rick and Juan square off. Juan growls and bares
          his teeth. Rick's MONSTER EYE starts to glow and pulse
          dimly. They circle each other. The others are transfixed.
                         
                         ELIJAH'S POV
                         
          He peers through a side window, and sees the pack of milkmen
          cheering two of their coworkers, locked in mortal combat.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           That's a lot of milkmen on the same
           route. No wonder they fight.
                         
          Juan rears back, about to lunge, when suddenly he freezes and
          looks off into the distance.
                         
                         A SQUIRREL
                         
          is sitting innocently a few yards off.
                         
                          JUAN
           Squirrel!
                         
          He zooms off after the squirrel. The Eyes pop out of the
          giant head and follow after him, Uzis FIRING. Juan dodges
          their bullets and disappears after his prey.
                         
          The freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after a
          pesky rodent. They turn to Rick.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Wow, giant Rasta eyeballs, just
           like Rick said.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           Gosh, if it wasn't for Rick, we'd
           all be dead!
           60.
                         
                         
                          OTHER FREAKS
           Yeah! Way to go Rick! Alright!
                         
                          ERNIE
                          (TO JULIE)
           God, I can't believe he left you
           for a squirrel. What a dick.
                         
          Julie's hurt. She doesn't even smack Ernie.
                         
                          RICK
           You know how men are. Besides, it
           was a pretty good looking squirrel.
                         
          Julie looks at Rick. She sees he's trying to be helpful, not
          sarcastic.
                         
                          JULIE
           (to the others)
           Come on. You heard the Beast Boy.
           Back to the Freak House, now.
                         
          Her eyes meet Rick's. She manages a smile, and Rick smiles
          back. Ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all
          head back to the Freak House.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Not again.
                          (TO RICK)
           Oh well, at least we'll get to try
           a new position.

          INT. STARK INTERROGATION ROOM
                         
          We're moving in towards a door in this desolate, vaguely
          corporate looking hallway.
                         
          INSIDE THE ROOM
                         
          We're looking at the back of Laughing Man's leather chair.
          We hear his CACKLE, as well as STUEY GLUCK'S TORTURED SCREAMS
          and a horrible POWER TOOL NOISE. We can see the usual bright
          interrogation spotlight, and a couple of extra GOONS watching
          the goings on, but Stuey and his actual torturer are hidden
          by Laughing Man's chair.
                         
           STUEY (O.S.)
           AHHHHH! STOP IT! OOOWWWWW!
                         
          We move past Mr. Big's chair to reveal Stuey lying face down
          on a table, while Bob Vila is using a power sander on his
          butt. Bob is happily giving pointers to the two goons.
           61.

           Notice the way I use an elliptical
           motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks.
           (the Goons nod
                          ATTENTIVELY)
           It's all here in my new book:

           A-HA-HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HA!
                         
          Bob obediently shuts up. Laughing Man directs a sinister low
          chuckle to Stuey.
                         
                          STUEY
           No way. I'll never talk! I'm made
           of stone!
                         
          Bob considers this a second, then starts up a jackhammer.
                         
                          STUEY

          We hear LONESOME HARMONICA MUSIC as we pan past the cubicles.
                         
          Cowboy is playing the harmonica... The Bearded Lady unties
          the pretty pink ribbon in his hair and sets it aside...
                         
          Suddenly, we switch to HORRIFIC PSYCHO STINGS as the camera
          picks up PAUL LYNDE'S CORPSE with flashing red lights. His
          eyeball drips out of the socket again...
                         
          Then it's back to the SAD HARMONICA MUSIC. In the next
          cubicle, Ernie is sleeping, Julie is awake, dreamily fondling
          a large eclair. She looks longingly up towards Rick's
          cubicle as we...

          Rick sits in his cubicle, visibly sickened by his daydream.
          Stuey's echoey voice drifts in.

          A holographic image of Stuey lying on the torture table
          appears over Rick. We can see the jackhammer looming over
          Stuey's face. Rick looks alarmed.

          spinning in his head, he takes the crumpled piece of paper
          out of his pocket and reads it.

          JULIE/ERNIE'S CUBICLE
                         
          Julie and Ernie are struggling over a bottle of deodorant.

          He hands her the notepaper. She reads it, with some
          difficulty. Ernie is still gagging on deodorant.

           And I've got a plan.
                         
          ANOTHER THRILLING CHORD.
                         
                          NOSEY
           I still say we kill him.
                         
          Sockhead nods again.
                         
                          RICK
           If we can get into Elijah's lab,
           maybe we can--
                         
                          WORM
           Of course! Design a super freak of
           our own and manipulate the genetic
           code to make him destroy Elijah
           instead of us! Brilliant!
                         
                          RICK
           Oh. Well--
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           But how do we get to the lab?
                         
                          RICK
           Um, maybe--
                         
                          COWBOY
           Right! The worm could dig a
           tunnel!
                         
                          WORM
           By God, it's so crazy it might just
           work!
                         
                          ERNIE
           But you need Noxon 24 to make the
           freaking sludge, and Elijah told us
           himself he's run out of it.
                         
                          RICK
           Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I
           was going to say was--
           66.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Yes! Exactly! If they've been
           using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer
           here, the entire ecosystem must be
           soaked with it! All we need is a
           way to extract it from the
           vegetation, ideally into a liquid
           form.
                         
                          RICK
           Right. Well, what about--
                         
                          COWBOY
           Golly! So that's why my milk comes
           out that funny green color! I
           thought the grass tasted funny!
           Wow, Rick, you're a genius!
                         
                          JULIE
                          (SMILES WARMLY)
           Good thinking, Rick.
                         
          The freaks all nod in agreement.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Way to go, Rick! How did you ever
           think of such a plan?
                         
          Rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for Sea
          Monkeys.
                         
                          RICK
           Well, actually, I was going to
           suggest we send away for sea
           monkeys, train them to fire guns,
           and make a break for it. But if
           you want to go with this other
           thing, I guess that's okay.
                         
          The freaks stare at him, not sure if he's kidding or not.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          FREAKS ON A MISSION MONTAGE, SET TO A POUNDING "EYE OF THE
          TIGER"-TYPE SONG
                         
          -Nosey milks Cowboy, squirting the glowing milk into a funnel
          which feeds into a crude still. The Torch heats the boiler.
                         
          -The Worm digs the tunnel. JulieErnie hand Rick pieces of
          wood which he puts into place as tunnel supports. They hand
          him Paul Lynde's corpse and he wedges it in as well.
           67.
                         
                         
          -Everyone's getting into it and working up a sweat. Nosey
          wipes his brow, opens a bottle of Pepsi and chugs it down in
          a beautifully lit slo-mo product shot... The other freaks
          follow suit, including the Worm, down in the tunnel, who
          struggles to hold the bottle in his tiny feeler.
                         
          Everything's going great and the song is really pumping
          when...
                         
                         ELIJAH
                         
          runs out on his front porch in his nightclothes and screams
          down at the outhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           WOULD YOU TURN DOWN THAT GODDAMN
           RACKET!?
                         
          IN THE FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Nosey turns off a boom box and the music cuts short. The
          freaks exchange tense looks. Nosey calls out apologetically
          to Elijah.
                         
                          NOSEY
           SOR-RY.
           (to the freaks)
           What a jerk!
                         
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL
                         
          The Worm burrows along, leaving a tunnel wide enough for Rick
          and JulieErnie to crawl after him. Rick notices a ray of
          light coming through a rock formation.
                         
                          RICK
           Hey, look at this!
                         
          They all stop and look. Rick fingers the hole, and the rocks
          cave in, revealing
                         
          A VAST UNDERGROUND CITY
                         
          It's obviously a matte painting.
                         
                          WORM
           Good Lord! It's the Lost City of
           Nodd!
                         
                          JULIE
           Wow!
           68.
                         
                         
          KER-CHUNK! We hear the sound of a slide projector switching
          slides and the underground city is replaced by a still image
          of some tourists standing around a geyser. [foriegn version:
          the Blarney Stone].
                         
                          RICK
           It's Old Faithful! (foriegn take:
           "It's the Blarney Stone!"]
                         
          They "Ooh" and "Ahh". The image switches to a snapshot of a
          FAT MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
                         
                          ERNIE
           It's my Aunt Gladys!
                         
          The other freaks nod politely. The image switches to a BAR
          MITZVAH PHOTO.
                         
                          ERNIE
           And that's me at my bar mitzvah!
                         
                          RICK
           C'mon Ernie, let's go.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Wait, you gotta see the ones from
           sleep-away camp! They're
           hilarious!
                         
          Julie smacks him.

           Stooge!
                         
                         
          EXT. FREAK COMPOUND - NIGHT
                         
          It's an "Antfarm View" of the yard, where the freaks are
          visible tunneling underground, and Toad is visible on the
          yard above them. We see a bat fly overhead... ZAP! Toad
          shoots out his tongue, snags it out of mid air, and chews it
          happily, oblivious to the freaks burrowing right underneath
          him.

          Nosey looks at the nearly full container of distilled Noxon.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Almost there.
           (he sniffs the air)
           But wait, I'm getting a whiff of
           things to come!
           69.

           Blood.
                         
          Bearded Lady looks grave..Nosey sniffs again.
                         
                          NOSEY
                          (CHEERFUL)

          They're burrowing along. Ernie loudly clears his throat.
          Julie spits out a loogie. She grimaces.
                         
                          JULIE
           I hate when you do that.
                         
          We hear muffled BARKING.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey! Do you hear that?
                         
                          JULIE
           It's a dog!
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO WORM)
           Hurry!
                         
          The Worm breaks through into a small cavern with several
          exposed sewer pipes. A lovable mutt leaps out of a pipe and
          drops an old tennis ball in front of Rick. He starts licking
          Rick's face.
                         
                          RICK
           Scrappy!
                         
          SAPPY MUSIC wells up.
                         
                          RICK
           It's been ten years since you
           chased this ball into the sewer! I
           thought you were gone for good!
                         
                          SCRAPPY
           Yap!
           70.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help.
           Understand?
                         
                          SCRAPPY
           Yap!
                         
                          RICK
           Good boy! Now go!
                         
          Scrappy runs away into the sewer pipe. Rick shrugs.
                         
                          RICK
           You never know.
                         
          Julie taps on some exposed wood on the cavern ceiling.
                         
                          JULIE
           Look, a wood floor.
                         
                          WORM
           It must be the lab! we've done it!
                         
          They all look at each other excitedly. Suddenly Elijah's
          voice rings out behind them.
                         
                          ELIJAH'S VOICE
           Not so fast, you scabrous freaks!
                         
          They spin around and see Nosey holding the bottle of Noxon
          24. He grins.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Didn't know I did impressions, did
           ya?
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          The freaks are waiting around the hole. Nosey pops out.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Mission accomplished. They've got
           the Noxon, and they'll be in the
           lab within minutes.
                         
                          FROGMAN
           Boy, this is going like clockwork!
                         
          Everyone smiles, pats each other on the back, etc. Except
          Sockhead, who finally snaps.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           No! Can't you see we're digging
           our own graves!?
                          (MORE)
           71.
                         
           It's nuts, SOCKHEAD(cont'd)
           that's what it is!
           Nuts! Well, maybe you've all got a
           deathwish, but you can count me
           out! I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF
           HERE!
                         
          He runs amok, pushes various freaks to the ground, and runs
          around screaming. The freak house door opens--Eye and Eye
          step in to check out the noise. One of them has a spliff
          sticking out of its pupil. Sockhead charges at them like a
          mad dog. They aim their Uzis.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD

           OUT OF MY WAY!
                         
          RATTA-RATTA-RATTA! They spray an ungodly amount of bullets
          into Sockhead. He falls to the ground. The Eyes leave.
                         
          The freaks gather around Sockhead. Nosey pulls the sock off
          his hand head, which is making a little "Senor Pepe" face
          with its fist. It spits up a trickle of blood and tries to
          speak.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD

           I... I... just... wanna...say...
                         
                          NOSEY
           What is it, kid?
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           Ah, forget it. I'm not much for
           dying.
                         
          He goes limp.

          JulieErnie, the Worm, and Rick are just emerging from the
          hole. It's really dark in the lab.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Shit. I can't see a damn thing.
                         
                          RICK
           Keep your voice down, Ernie.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Don't push me, Coog. I got a real
           short fuse today. I'm cranky,
           bloated, got a wicked case of
           cramps. Don't ask why.

           PMS...
                         
                          RICK
           (has to think about this)
           Oh.... Right.
                         
          Rick pats Ernie on the shoulder reassuringly. He moves over
          to Elijah's computer terminal.
                         
                          RICK

           Well, here it is--the control panel
           for Elijah's Freaking process.
                         
                          WORM
           Good work, my boy. Now step aside.
           This is scientist's work.
                         
          Worm muscles Rick out of the way and sits at the console.
          Using a pen held in his mouth, he flicks a series of switches
          and punches a fast series of computer keys.
                         
          The light on top of the Tasty Freekz machine starts to
          revolve, and after a couple of seconds, a stream of GOOEY
          LIGHT BROWN GLOP oozes out of the spigot.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey! It's working!
                         
                          RICK
           You did it, Worm! Way to go!
                         
                          JULIE
           But how? You didn't even use the
           Noxon.
                         
          The Worm rushes over to the container of glop below the
          spigot, and without hesitation, plunges his face into it!
          Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror!
                         
          The WORM lifts his glop-smeared face out of the bowl, and
          smacks his lips in delight.
                         
                          WORM
           Ah! You don't need Noxon to make
           Butterscotch pudding. I just
           wanted to test the machine's
           capabilities. Mmmm! Glorious! So
           creamy! Yum!
                         
          The Worm is lost in his pudding-induced reverie. They ignore
          him. Julie turns to Rick.
           73.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Hang on, Rick. Do you really think
           we should put this toxic glop on
           you? What if it doesn't work?
           What if something goes wrong? What
                          IF--
                         
                          ERNIE
           If it does work, do you think
           there'll be enough left over to
           give me a monster size rodney?
                         
          Julie goes to doink Ernie in the eyes, but he uses the
          classic "Three Stooges" handblock.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Here, hold this.
                         
          Rick hands the container of Noxon to Ernie. Julie gives him
          the eyepoke. Rick shakes hands with Julie, and takes back
          the Noxon.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Thanks.
           (to Julie, heroically)
           Look, I've been a freak all my
           life.' I realize that now. Up
           there on that screen, humiliating
           myself for every fool with six

           Sometimes seven fifty.
                         
                          RICK
           Alright. It doesn't matter.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Sure it does. They don't let you
           into the theater if you don't pay
           the price of the ticket.
                         
                          RICK
           Look, I'm talking about the
           ultimate human sacrifice.
                         
                          JULIE
           No kidding. When you consider
           money for parking, popcorn,
           drinks...

           Hey! In case you haven't noticed,
           I'm about to commit a noble and
           selfless act here.
                         
          Rick pounds the table, sending a glass beaker flying. It
          smashes through the window, setting off a loud SIREN.

          Elijah's in his robe, watching the opening of "Crooked Cops"
          on TV. On screen is a revolving police beacon on a beat-up
          car, with a loud SIREN. Elijah munches his popcorn happily.

          Julie manages to silence the alarm by yanking the cord out of
          its socket. She shoots Rick a hard look, he shrugs
          innocently.
                         
                          RICK
           Oops.

           Okay. Let's do what we came to do,
           and this time, no more screw ups.
                         
          Rick slams his hand down for emphasis and impales it on one
          of those desktop paper pins. He SCREAMS in agony.

          Elijah's watching an old war movie--a soldier is running
          across a battlefield with a bayonet, SCREAMING. He doesn't
          hear Rick.

          Julie has her hand over Rick's mouth, silencing his scream.
          He calms down. He gingerly slides the pin out of his hand,
          grimacing but not making a sound. He sighs with relief. The
          coast seems clear. Then, in SLOW MOTION, his hand knocks a
          styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground.

          The war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns
          blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works.
          Suddenly, his ears perk up, and his head swivels around
          towards the window.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Styrofoam cup?
                         
          He puts on his "smiley face" robe and bunny slippers and
          heads out the door.

           No. Here goes.
                         
          He presses some buttons on the computer, and the Tasty Freekz
          machine starts humming. Ernie is looking out the window.
                         
                          ERNIE

          an empty Pepsi cup under the Tasty Freekz spigot. A drop of
          ointment drips out and into the container.

          opening. Julie and Ernie get in the hole with Worm, while

          board over his head. The RUMBLING gets louder as the tunnel
          walls start to crumble.
                         
                          JULIE
           Rick! Come on!
                         
          Rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him.
          He sways, and knocks the Pepsi cup of sludge rolling. He
          watches, helpless, as it rolls across the floor and comes to
          a stop across the room. For a second, he contemplates making
          a dash.
                         
                         OUTSIDE
                         
          Elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob, and
          finally has a good grip. He twists the knob...
                         
                         INSIDE
                         
          Rick sees the door opening. He dives down into the hole.
          The floor board falls into place just as Elijah walks in.
                         
          Elijah scans the room. He goes over towards the Tasty Freekz
          machine and finds the styrofoam cup.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Bad for the environment.
                         
          He crumples it in his hand.
                         
                         
          EXT. FREAK COMPOUND
                         
          The "antfarm view" again. We see the freaks running back
          through the tunnel as it caves in behind them. Toad sits on
          the ground above, oblivious to them. We hear a low flying
          aircraft... ZAP! Toad shoots his tongue up out of frame and
          sucks the twin engine Cessna into his mouth. Beat. He BURPS
          and spits up a propeller.
           78.
                         
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          The freaks wait by the mouth of the tunnel. We hear the
          rumble approach. The worm, JulieErnie, and finally Rick
          scramble out of the opening. The dirt avalanche is stopped
          short by Paul Lynde's corpse, just as Rick scrambles to
          safety.
                         
                          WORM
           Just made it!
                         
                          RICK
           Paul saved our lives!
                         
                          NOSEY
           Way to go, Paul!
                         
          Nosey claps Paul on what's left of his back--his skeleton
          shatters and the tunnel collapses, burying him instantly.
          The freaks are horrified.
                         
                         NOSEY
                         
          turns to them guiltily in SLOW-MOTION. His voice is slowed
          down and distorted like John Lennon at the end of "Strawberry
                         FIELDS":
                         
                          NOSEY
           I... buried... Paul.
                         
          Back to normal speed.
                         
                          RICK
           This is no time to lament over a
           cadaver! We've got to get moving,
           or we're history! Now c'mon!
                         
          Nosey is still morose. He speaks backwards and sounds a lot
          like "Revolution #9".
                         
                          NOSEY

           I said enough! Okay, listen up,
           everybody. We cracked the code and
           made the ointment we need to bring
           Skuggs down for good.
                         
          The freaks applaud and cheer.
           79.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           But we left it in the lab.
                         
          The freaks jeer and pelt Rick with rotten vegetables. He
          desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket.
                         
                          RICK
           But wait! I found some macaroons!
           And there's plenty for all of us!
                         
          The freaks burst into applause again.
                         
                          FREAKS

          INT. FREAK HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Freaks are all sleeping, macaroon crumbs still left on
          their faces. There's a lot of snoring. Rick awakens with a
          start. He hears something in the distance. Something like a
          helicopter... He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall.
                         
                         
          RICK'S POV. EXT. FREAKLAND - DAY
                         
          An EES corporate helicopter touches down. A few gun-toting
          SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out. They
          check that the coast is clear, then give the signal. Out
          steps Richard Hertz. He mutters something to one of the
          security guys, and walks towards the Freak House.
                         
          IN THE FREAK HOUSE
                         
                          RICK
           (under his breath)
           I don't believe it. What's Hertz
           doin' here?
                         
          The door to the Freak House opens. Hertz enters, unzips his
          fly. Finding no toilet, he shrugs and relieves himself on
          the floor. Rick steps out of the shadows towards him.
                         
                          RICK
           So EES is in bed with Elijah C.
           Skuggs, eh? Figures.
                         
          Hertz is momentarily startled by Rick. He collects himself.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Rick! Thank God I got to you in
           time!
           80.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Cut the crap, Hertz.
                         
          Hertz relieves himself as he talks.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Ricky, you have no idea how your
           misfortune has touched our hearts.
           When you disappeared we almost gave
           up hope. But we'd heard reports of
           Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon,
           and when the story broke in the
           tabloids, I decided to personally
           come down and get to the bottom of
           things.
                         
          He zips up and heads to the door.
                         
                          RICK
                          (SKEPTICAL)
           Really?
                         
                          HERTZ
           No.
                          (BEAT)
           AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE
           HO HO HO HA HA HA HA!
                         
          The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as
          he realizes... Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out
          the door. Rick looks after him, stunned.
                         
          We hear a nearby SNORE cut off, and the Human Torch stands up
          from the spot where Hertz relieved himself. He's dripping
          wet and no longer on fire. He sniffs his soaked, smoldering
          clothing.
                         
                          TORCH
           Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That
           really pisses me off!
                         
          POOF! He catches fire again and walks off. Rick is doing a
          slow burn, still looking after Hertz. He erupts and his
          monster eye glows briefly. He screams in anguish.
                         
                          RICK
           AAARRGGGGHH!
                         
          Dejected, Rick leans against the wall. JulieErnie walk up
          behind him. Julie puts a hand on Rick's shoulder to comfort
          him. As they look into each other's eyes, a loud CRASH
          distracts them. Rick peers through the crack.
           81.

          A caravan of EES trucks crash through the front gate and
          drive up to the lab. There's a few cargo trucks and a huge
          NOXON-24 tanker.
                         
                          RICK
           Holy shit.
                         
          A forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks,
          carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette.
                         
          One of them falls off, and a bunch of WORKMEN scramble out to
          prop him up and push him back into place.
                         
                         
          INT. LAB - DAY
                         
          Elijah switches on the lights, and turns to face his
          audience. Hertz is accompanied by his stone-faced security
          men and various executives. Workmen are busy installing the
          old board of directors and their arm-raising pulley system.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Nice to see you in the flesh,
           Laughing Man.
                         
                          HERTZ
           No need to use codenames, Elijah.
           We're all friends here. And just
           to prove it, I brought you a little
           present.
                         
          Hertz snaps his fingers and nods to a security guy, who
          produces a wriggling canvas sack. He dumps its contents onto
          the lab table--it's Stuey Gluck! His glasses come tumbling
          out after him. He squints at the security guy.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick? Is that you?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Who's the troll?
                         
                          HERTZ
           He was asking questions about
           Coogan, causing trouble. We
           figured he was one of yours.
                         
          Stuey puts on his glasses. Elijah looks him up and down.
                         
                          ELIJAH

           yourself, mister.
                          (CALLS OUT)
           Rick! Riiiick! Riii--
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Rick hears Stuey's voice in his head, all echoey.
                         
           STUEY(V.0.)
           --iiiiiick!
                         
                          RICK
           Oh no, not now, Stuey!
                         
          The ghostly image of STUEY gradually takes shape in front of
          Rick. Rick can make out the lab table Stuey's on, and some
          shadowy figures in the background.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Hey. That's Elijah's lab!
                          (TO STUEY)
           Stuey! Are you really in the lab?
                         
                         
          INT. LAB
                         
          Stuey is still wailing, and everybody else is getting pretty
          damn annoyed.
                         
                          STUEY
           Yes! I'm in the lab! I'm in the
           lab!

           Not only ugly, he's crazy too.
                         
          Toad grabs Stuey and slaps a piece of tape over his mouth.
          He throws him into one of the chicken cages along the far
          wall. A two-headed chicken starts to peck at him.
                         
                          HERTZ
           So, where were we?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Gentlemen, I'm not going to
           bullshit you. I know my setup here
           at Freakland looks like small
           potatoes.

          He pulls the cover off a small scale model of Freakland,
          about ten inches high. It shows the stage, lab, outhouse,
          the head, everything.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           But thanks to your Noxon and my
           genius, tonight I will turn Ricky
           Coogan into a freak so hideous,
           it'll be enough to turn your
           stomach inside out, boil your brain
           in its own juice, and cause cold
           sores you thought had healed up to
           start buggin' you again.
           (the EES men shift
                          UNCOMFORTABLY)
           It's the dawning of a new age for
           us all. Behold, Super Mega Freak
           World!
                         
          He whisks the cover off another scale model--it's exactly the
          same as the little model except it's a lot bigger.

           It's really somethin', huh?

          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Rick is watching all of this in a ghostly image.
                         
                          RICK
           Stuey! Stuey, can you hear me?
                         
          Stuey's image, still with his mouth taped shut and the
          chicken pecking at him, nods yes.
                         
                          STUEY
           Mmm hmmm!
                         
                          RICK
           I want you to try and escape. Get
           the cup from underneath the
           instrument table and bring it to
           me, okay?
                         
                          STUEY
                          (NODS)
           Mmmm mmmmm!
           84.
                         
                         
          He gives Rick the old trademark Coogan thumbs up. Rick
          halfheartedly returns the gesture.
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, right. Get movin'.
                         
                         
          INT. LAB
                         
          Stuey checks to make sure nobody's watching him. They're
          not. He removes the spring from a pocket pen and picks the
          lock. Stuey searches the floor, and spots the Pepsi cup.
          He'll have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach
          it.
                         
                          HERTZ
           At EES, our plans for your Gene
           Machine include everything, except
           shoes that is. Ha-ha-ha.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Ha-ha. Gee, I'd love to see your
           plans.
                         
                          HERTZ
           We'd love to show you.
           (to his assistant)
           Bill, if you'd be so kind.
                         
          BILL BLAZER, a slick and dashing EES marketing executive,
          strides confidently up to the podium.
                         
          Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. Bill steps over
          him, not even noticing he's there.
                         
          Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and
          replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit
          Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a
          little hurt.
                         
                          BILL
           What does today's businessman want?
           How about a receptionist with six
           arms, five mouths, and a knockout
           figure? That'd sure speed things
           up, wouldn't it?
                         
          With a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi-
          limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different
          phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once.
                         
          Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the
          back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,
          who smiles politely. Hertz smiles back, invitingly. Maybe
          there's a few things we don't know about him.
           85.
                         
                         
                          BILL
           In the factory, how 'bout a worker
           with twelve busy hands, no mouth to
           talk back, and no genitalia or
           digestive system to distract him
           from his work?
                          (HE CHUCKLES)
           Sure! It's what we all dream of!
                         
          The EES guys all nod along. Except for the workmen, who
          exchange worried looks. Elijah's still not sure what to make
          of it all.
                         
          Meanwhile, Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and
          he's crawling under the table towards the door. He brushes
          up against the back of Elijah's legs.
                         
          Elijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again.
          Elijah looks away quickly, panicky.
                         
                          BILL (CONT'D)
           Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon
           technology, it's not only possible,
           it's just the beginning! Of
           course, what happened to our
           expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan
           was an unfortunate coincidence, but
           profits from these new markets
           could total in the billions.
                         
          All the executives turn to Hertz. He cracks a smile.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Ricky who?
                         
          The executives laugh heartily. Stuey glances across the room
          to the door. He has to make a break for it, so he does.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Hey! Hold on!
                         
          Stuey freezes. He's right out in the open, in plain view.
          Still, nobody seems to see him. They're still watching-
          Bill's presentation.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Secretaries? Worker drones?
           Where's the fun? Where's the
           spark? Where's the unspeakable
           evil?
                         
          Bill laughs pleasantly.
                         
                          BILL
           Ha-ha. I was just getting to that.
           86.
                         
                         
          Bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than
          even the best infomercials. Meanwhile, Stuey inches towards
          the door, moving as imperceptibly as possible.
                         
                          BILL
           We'll impact every field.
                          COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT
           creams, nosejobs in a bottle.
           Military--human death machines that
           make Schwarzenegger look like a
           pansy! And why stop at consumer
           products? Hell, we can design a
           whole new consumer! A few well
           placed drops in the water supply,
           and bingo! It's a new master race,
           and we own the copyright! An
           entire planet of freaks owned and
           operated by us! Every part of
           their bodies comes from an EES
           supplier, every thought they think
           is EES policy! From now on
           gentlemen, it's EES uber alles!
           EES uber alles!
                         
          The EES guys clap and shout approval. Elijah's impressed
          too. He leans over to Hertz.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           This guy's good.
                         
                          HERTZ
           We lured him away from A.T.&T.
                         
          Stuey is finally out the door. Of course, now they spot him.
                         
                          SECURITY GUY
           Look! The troll!
                         
                          HERTZ
           After him!
                         
                         
          EXT. LAB
                         
          Stuey is outside the lab. Inexplicably, (actually it's just
          because he's so stupid) he's still moving inch by inch. He
          calls to Rick through the tape on his mouth.
                         
                          STUEY
           Mmm! Mmmmm!
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Rick sees the image of Stuey inching away from the lab.
           87.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Take the tape off your mouth,
           idiot! They didn't tie your hands!
                         
          Stuey realizes this is true, and pulls the tape off his
          mouth.
                         
                          STUEY
           I got the cup, Rick!
                         
                          RICK
           Great! There's no time to waste.
           Are you being followed?
                         
                          STUEY
           Yeah. But if I don't move, they
           won't see me.
                         
          Two big EES security guys are standing watching Stuey's odd
          behavior. They pick him up and carry him away.
                         
                          STUEY
           Riiiick!
                         
          Rick sees this all in his holographic image. It fades.
                         
                          RICK
           What a geek.
                         
          He turns to the other freaks, who've woken up and are
          gathered around on the floor. Rick shakes his head.
                         
                          RICK
           Stuey got caught. There's no way
           to get the ointment before the
           show.
                         
                          WORM
           So, that's it then? We're all to
           die... And by your hand no less.
                         
                          RICK
           No. It won't be me. It's some
           inhuman monster Elijah used me to
           create. As for me, the real me,
           I'll always be your friend. Before
           I have to rip your heads off, I'd
           like to say goodbye to each of you.
           (He turns to Worm.)
           Worm... I'll miss your brains, the
           smell of your pipe, and the funny
           way you always go on talking until
           everyone wants to strangle you.
                         
          He pats the Worm on the head tenderly, and turns to Cowboy.
           88.
                         
                         
                          COWBOY
           Hi, Rick.
                         
                          RICK
           Cowboy, I'll miss your good humor,
           your down-home wisdom, and of
           course, the frothy milkshakes were
           udderly delicious, heh-heh...
                         
          He smiles and playfully tugs Cowboy's udder. He turns to the
          Bearded Lady.
                         
                          RICK
           Bearded... Lady... I dunno.
           We'll always have Paris...
                         
          Bearded lady is kind of confused, Rick shrugs.
                         
                          RICK
           Nosey, I never really liked you.
                         
          He moves on to Frog Man.
                         
                          RICK
           Frog Man, I think death is probably
           the best thing for you now.
                         
          Frog Man nods in agreement. Rick rpaches JulieErnie.
                         
                          RICK
           Ernie... Julie... I have mixed
           feelings.
           (He turns to Ernie)
           On one hand, I'll remember you as
           the best friend a jerk like me ever
           had, and a low down repulsive
           slimeball.
                         
          He turns to Julie. ROMANTIC MUSIC swells up.
                         
                          RICK (CONT'D)
           On the other hand, I really respect
           you, and more than that, I, uh,
           well, I wish we'd had the chance to
           boink.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, Rick...
                         
          They embrace. Rick calls out to the assembled group.
                         
                          RICK
           Today I make the proudest boast a
           man can utter: "Ich bien ein
           Freak!"
           89.
                         
                         
          They're all ready to cheer, but they're confused by his bad
          German. Rick has to explain himself.
                         
                          RICK
           Uh, I'm a freak.
                         
          Oh. They all get it. Beat. Then they cheer.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT..CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT
                         
          A huge banner reads "NEW IMPROVED BEAST BOY SLAUGHTERS HIS
          LOVED ONES! SPECIAL GUEST: FUNNYMAN DOM IRERRA! TONIGHT
          ONLY!". We can hear the sound of the crowd inside.
                         
          INSIDE THE TENT
                         
          There's a typically smallish crowd in addition to the EES
          executives who occupy the front seats. The security goons
          are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of
          them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row. Elijah
          is onstage.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           And now the moment you've all been
           waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen,
           meet the lucky young man who's
           about to be become the monster with
           the mostest! Here he is, the Beast
           Boy!
                         
          Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing Rick
          strapped to an operating table. On stage left there's a
          large cage containing all the other freaks. Including the
          unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the
          freak house. The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic,
          grabs the bars of the cage, and screams--
                         
                          MILK MAN
           AAHHHH! WE'RE IN A ZOO!
                         
          Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey, who waves the
          Pepsi cup full of glop in the air. Rick hears Stuey's voice
          echo in his head telepathically.
                         
           STUEY (V.0.)
           Rick! Over here!
                         
          Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed
          BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds
          up a beaker of ointment.
           90.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           With this remarkable ointment of my
           own design, I will now turn this
           half-finished ghoul into the
           ultimate super freak, dedicated to
           evil!
                         
          Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick,
          who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey.
          He calls out telepathically.
                         
           RICK (V.0.)
           Stuey! Where are you?!
                         
          Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally
          blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies.
                         
           STUEY (V.0.)
           Here I am, Rick!
                         
                          BIKER
                          (TO STUEY)
           Goddammit, kid! Would you sit
           down!?
                         
          The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The
          "good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body.
                         
                          STUEY
           AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
                         
          All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto
          the floor screaming.
                         
                          RICK
           Oh no!
                         
                          BIKER
           What the hell!?
                         
          Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to
          its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a
          switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade
          crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He
          drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He
          leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah.
                         
                          STUEY MONSTER
           YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!
                         
          Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE
           AND EYE! KILL HIM!
           91.
                         
                         
          Eye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing.
                         
           EYE AND EYE
           RASTAFARI!
                         
          The bullets bounce off Stuey's hide. He doinks them with his
          big monster fingers and sends them flying through...
                         
          THE TENT ROOF
                         
          across the compound, and THWOPP! Into the Giant Head's eye
          sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed.
          CRASH! The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over
          backwards.
                         
                         
          INT. CARNIVAL TENT
                         
          Elijah calls out to Toad.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           TOAD!
                         
          Stuey Monster roars at Toad. Toad smiles weakly.
                         
          THE TENT ROOF
                         
          Toad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye
          across the compound and CRASH! Lands head first into the
          neck of the Giant Head. He gets up with the Giant Head stuck
          on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed
          caricatures. He runs blindly across the yard and into...
                         
          THE ELECTRIC FENCE
                         
          ZZZAAAAPPP! BOINNGG! Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets,
          and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's
          mouth. It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever!
                         
                         ELIJAH
                         
          looks worried. He scoops up some "evil ointment".
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Looks like it's time to roll out
           the big gun.
                          (TO RICK)
           Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words?
                         
          Rick considers it. He can't think of anything.
                         
                          RICK
           Nahh.
           92.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Suit yourself.
                         
          He raises the ointment over Rick. Rick has an idea for a
          last word.
                         
                          RICK
           Wait! Wait!
           (Elijah pauses. Rick
                          RECONSIDERS)
           Nahh.
                         
          Elijah glops Rick. His skin starts to smoke.
                         
                          RICK
           AHHHHRRRGGG!
                         
          Stuey Monster stalks Elijah onstage. Rick is smoking and
          shaking violently on the table.
                         
                         HERTZ
                         
          turns to his EES cronies in the audience. He looks bored.
                         
                          HERTZ
           What a waste of twelve bucks.
           Let's get the machine and go.
                         
          The other executives nod.
                         
                         RICK
                         
          starts to transform. FWOOP! His ears spring out into huge
          monster ears, kinda like in Pinocchio. FWAAP! His mouth
          grows into a massive, Big Daddy Roth style monster mouth.
          FWEEP! His upper head does the same.
                         
          His body follows suit. He bursts' out of the straps and
          grows into a drooling TEN FOOT TALL RICK MONSTER. He snarls
          at Stuey Monster.
                         
                          RICK MONSTER
           TIME TO DIE, TROLL!
                         
          The crowd and the other freaks look on, tense. Stuey Monster
          instinctively whips out a Ricky Coogan publicity photo and a
          pen.
                         
                          STUEY MONSTER
           Rick! Rick! Could you sign
           this!?
                         
          Rick Monster snarls and bashes Stuey Monster in the face.
          Stuey Monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls back.
           93.
                         
                         
                          THE CROWD
           FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
                         
          Even Julie is screaming "Fight! Fight," beside herself with
          bloodthirsty glee. Ernie smacks her.
                         
          The crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche
          pro-wrestling moves. Stuey bashes Rick. Rick bashes Stuey,
          etc.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Give him the skull cracker, ya big
           goon!
                         
                          ERNIE
           No way! The skull cracker is an
           illegal move!
                         
          Stuey grabs Rick's hair and marches him around the stage.
          The crowd is taking sides, screaming out advice, and foaming
          at their mouths.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Let's get this over with. Hey
           Hertz, tell your goons to
           (he turns to Hertz and is
                          STUNNED)
           What the hell-!?
                         
                         HERTZ
                         
          stands in front of the a group of EES HARDHATS who are using
          forklifts to move the Tasty Freekz Machine towards the exit.
          He notices Elijah and taps his executive ASSISTANT.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
                          (TO ELIJAH)
           Ahem. At this point in time we at
           EES regret that we must leave this
           performance prematurely.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           What are you saying!?
                         
                          HERTZ
           What we're saying is... get
           stuffed, yokel.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I figured I couldn't trust you
           corporate greaseballs!
                         
          Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads "BREAK
          GLASS IN CASE OF DOUBLECROSSING CORPORATE GREASEBALLS." He
          breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside.
           94.
                         
          A trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises
          out of it. Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret
          nozzle atop the tank. He aims the nozzle at the EES group.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Let me proudly introduce the latest
           in our product line, Noxon 25--now
           available in a convenient pump!
                         
                          HERTZ
           Bullshit! The Everything Except
           Shoes corporation releases no new
           products unless I give the order!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I think it's time EES branched out
           a little.
                         
          He presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of
          yellow glop on the EES people. They scream in agony as their
          bodies melt together into one big mutating blob.
                         
          Alistair Cooke stands up in the audience--he's got a head
          bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show.
                         
                          ALISTAIR COOKE
           Ahhh! Head for the hills before he
           gets all of us!
                         
          The crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits, trampling poor
          Cooke like a roach.
                         
                         RICK MONSTER
                         
          flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him.
          Stuey is knocked out cold. Rick leaves him on the floor and
          stalks the freak cage murderously.
                         
                          RICK MONSTER
           NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES!
                         
                          JIMIE
           No! We're your friends!
                         
                          RICK MONSTER
           Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES!
                         
          He rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear
          JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs
          his leg and trips him. Stuey summons all his remaining
          energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from
          slaughtering the freaks.
                         
          Meanwhile, Elijah is watching as
                         
          THE EES BLOB
           95.
                         
                         
          solidifies into... A GIANT SHOE made of living flesh. It's
          got eyeballs where the eyes should be, a tongue where the
          tongue should be, but it's helpless and immobile.
                         
          Elijah looks at it with pride. He does his best Ed Sullivan
                         IMPRESSION:
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Now that's a really, really big
           shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think
           I'd like a pair of those!
                         
          He swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks
          and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey,
          blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage. Rick raises
          the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through
          his chest.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (to Rick monster)
           Would you hurry up and waste the
           troll, please!? I got a lonely

                          KATHIE LEE
           Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've
           been talking for almost ninety
           minutes, and we've just got to go
           to a commercial.
                         
                          RICK

          A BURLY HAND swipes all the cheese off the block and slams
          down an aluminum can labeled "MACHEESMO."

           And now back to the exciting
           conclusion of Ricky Coogan's
           incredible story.
                         
                          RICK
           Well, let's see, the other freaks
           were lined up in Elijah's sights,
           and I was about to shove a pipe
           through Stuey's skull, when all of
           a sudden, I heard a voice...
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT
                         
          Rick stops the spear inches from Stuey's chest. Their eyes
          meet.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Kill him! Kill him!
                         
          Elijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and Cowboy's voice
          reverberates in Rick's head.
           97.
                         
                         
           COWBOY (V.O.)
           I reckon that troll could help you
           if you just let him into your
           heart... your heart... your
           heart...
                         
          The voice keeps echoing. A tear wells up in Rick Monster's
          eye. He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to
          him from the cage.
                         
                          COWBOY
           Your heart... your heart... your
           heart...
                         
          Rick Monster loses his murderous glare. He breaks into a
          warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up.
          They hug. The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly.

           Hey, ain't that somethin'?
                         
          The Worm is gushing sentimentally. He tries to hide his
          tears.
                         
                          WORM

           (Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa!
                         
          He can't hold it in anymore. He bawls like a baby.
          Meanwhile, Elijah is hopping mad.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and
           start mutilating each other!
                         
          He aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button. The
          Glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the
          tip, Rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to
          face Elijah.
                         
                          RICK
           Raarrrrrrgh!
                         
          Elijah manages to duck just in time. A stream of yellow
          Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the DUNK
          TANK full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the
          tent.
                         
          The acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly.
                         
          Elijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off
          against Rick Monster.
           98.
                         
          Meanwhile, Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from
          the cage. They watch the confrontation from a distance.
                         
          Elijah rolls up his sleeves. Rick growls and advances
          slowly.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           You think I made you strong? HA!
           I've cranked my DNA up so high, you
           won't know what hit you. I'm a
           wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa!
                         
          He rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid
          section. They have absolutely no effect. Rick brings one
          heavy fist slamming down on Elijah's head, stopping him cold.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (WEAKLY)
           Ow! I think you crushed my spinal
           cord. I can't feel anything in my
           fingers.
                         
                          RICK
           Maybe you'll feel this ...
                         
          Rick rears back to kick him.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Qait--if you kill me, you'll never
           find the antidote.
                         
          The freaks all perk up. Rick's skeptical.
                         
                          RICK
           What antidote?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           A time release serum--I baked it
           into a delicious batch of
           macaroons.
                         
          A slow smile grows on the Freaks' faces, especially Rick's.
                         
                          RICK
           If you ask me, you skimped on the
           coconut!
                         
          THWAK! Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him
          flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over
          the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye
          target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of
          bravado, Elijah makes a last stand.
           99.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You
           haven't got the guts to kill me!
           Go on! I dare ya'!
                         
          Rick ponders for a second. He looks over to Julie. Then...
                         
                          SCRAPPY

           Scrappy!
                         
          Scrappy the dog rushes in. He leaps up and presses the
          bullseye, dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!
                         
          Elijah struggles in agony. His body bubbles and mutates in
          the thick toxic soup. He sinks lower and lower into the
          gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good.
                         
          Scrappy leaps into Rick's arms and licks his face.

          Another FBI GUY investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat
          floating on top of the bubbling ooze.
                         
           ANOTHER FBI GUY
           Looks like they took care of
           Skuggs, chief.
                         
          The chief nods. They put away their guns, and approach Rick
          and the rest of the jubilant freaks.
                         
                          CHIEF
           Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a
           medal from the Vice President for
           this.

           far his sick plans would've gone.
                         
           ANOTHER FBI GUY
           Hey chief, look at this!
                         
          The FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine,
          revealing that it's actually a Coke machine! The chief is
          sickened to the core.
                         
                          FBI CHIEF
           Is nothing sacred?
                         
          Suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream.
          They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see.
                         
                          FBI CHIEF
           Oh, my Lord!

          We SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of

          him/them ELIJUS and ELLY LEE. They both have glowing red
          demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice.

          The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks
          perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was
          caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile
          behind him.

           for Ricky Coogan!
                         
          The audience applauds and hoots wildly.
                         
                          KATHIE LEE
           Can we bring out the other freaks
           now?
                         
          The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from
          the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience.
          They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with
          their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I
          was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm,
          who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".
           102.
                         
                         
                          WORM
           Ridiculous... Just because a man
           doesn't like macaroons...
           Nonsense.
                         
          Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He
          pounces and catches the furry little bugger.
                         
                          JUAN
           Gotcha! Damn, it's about time!
                         
           ALL THE EX-FREAKS
           (happy to see him)
           JUAN!
                         
                          JUAN
           Hey guys! Jeez! You look great!
                         
          They all hug.
                         
                          REGIS
           That's just great. What a story.
           And what an ending! Elijah
           transformed by the goop!
                         
                          KATHIE LEE
           And he really looked like--?
                         
                          RICK
           Exactly like you two, I swear.
           Same faces, same outfits, except
           they had these really big, hideous
           feet...
                         
          He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big,
          hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red--
          It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice.
                         
                          ELIJUS
           Show's over, Ricky!
                         
                          ELLY LEE
           I'm gonna drink your blood!
                         
          Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on
          Rick's throat when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny.
          They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the
          audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie
          stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick.
          They embrace.
                         
                          JULIE
           Rick! It's finally over!
           103.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Yes... Yes it is.
                         
           STUEY(O.C.)
           Rick! Rick!
                         
          Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall
          monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag
          dripping blood.
                         
                          RICK
           Stuey!
                         
                          STUEY
           Look! I found the real Regis and
           Kathie Lee!
                         
          Rick and Julie look at the bag, mortified. Stuey chuckles.
                         
                          STUEY (CONT'D)
           No, this is just my lunch!
                         
          Rick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar
          leaking bag and holds it up.
                         
                          STUEY
           (matter of fact)
           This is Regis and Kathie Lee.
                         
          Rick and Julie nod casually--"Oh."
                         
                          AUDIENCE
           Awwww!
                         
          Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch,
          bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and
          Julie when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out
          and they fall dead--again.
                         
          Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Oh, like that wasn't totally
           predictable.
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, now it really is over.
                         
          Sappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up.
                         
                          RICK
           Thank God. You know, this
           adventure has taught me something.
                          (MORE)
           104.
                          RICK(CONT'D)
           When man starts impinging on the
           subtle perfection of the earth's
           natural order, the only thing he'll
           create is havoc.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Right, Coog. I learned somethin'
           too. That men and women truly are
           equals. That the human spirit
           transcends gender and physical
           appearance, and thus it is immune
           to the petty degradations men may
           devise. I believe it was Moliere
                          WHO SAID--
                         
          Julie's had enough. She socks Ernie square on the jaw.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, shut up.
           (She turns to Rick)
           Let's go fuck.
                         
          Rick gives her the thumbs up. They turn to the audience.
                         
           RICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTER
           Good night, everybody!
                         
          The audience cheers. The HIT SINGLE from the soundtrack
          album kicks in as we...
                         
                         ROLL CREDITS
                         
          As the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and
          wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack
          again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.
          Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they
          attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
          to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and
          Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely
          stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts
          the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand
          gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has
          to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down
          to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,
          charging everyone five bucks per blow.
                         
          As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing,
          kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite
          morning show hosts.
                         
           THE END?!

          DARKNESS. SILENCE. The following words sear onto screen:
          Whenever a new breed of evil
          emerges, a new breed of solider
          must fight it.

          -- GENERAL CLAYTON "HAWK" ABERNATHY

          EXT. THE BASTILLE - PARIS - NIGHT

          A HEAVY NIGHT MIST swirls around the imposing stone walls of
          the Bastille. PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes
          as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows.

          SUPER: PARIS, 1641

          INT. PRISON BLOCK - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT

          A pair of huge PRISON GUARDS walk down a row of filthy prison
          cells. Whimpering, starving PRISONERS appear and disappear in
          the flickering light of the wall torches. A large rat nibbles
          some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards.
          Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose PRISONER is not at
          all whimpering or starving. A huge Scotsman with a proud
          defiance in his eyes, a RED SQUARE MEDALLION dangling around
          his neck, glares through the bars. This is JAMES McCULLEN.
          The guards unlock his cell door, MATCHLOCK MUSKETS at the
          ready. McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed. He speaks
          with a thick Scottish brogue.

          MCCULLEN
          Still using matchlocks, are ya? I
          can get you a pair of flintlocks,
          you let me sneak out of here.
          Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent.

          GUARD #1

          (TEMPTED)
          Good ones?
          The other Guard glares at him. McCullen goes for the kill.

          MCCULLEN
          The best. From Spain. And perhaps a
          couple of pretty young ladies to
          teach you how to use them.
          Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist.

          GUARD #2
          On yer feet, you Scottish pig.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          INT. FURNACE - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT

          Huge, sweaty, bare-chested PRISON WORKERS mould something in
          a furnace, a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs. The
          two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to
          fasten him to a standing rack as a PRIEST begins reciting the
          Lord's Prayer in Latin. The Warden steps up and reads the
          charges off a SCROLL OF PAPER.

          WARDEN
          James McCullen, you have been found
          guilty of treason for the sale of
          military arms to the enemies of our
          Lord King Louis XIII... even whilst
          you sold arms to our Lord himself.

          MCCULLEN
          Your King is a vile bag of filth
          who murders his own allies. I
          should've charged him double.

          WARDEN
          You tried to overthrow the Crown in
          conspiracy with its enemies!

          MCCULLEN
          They offered me a Chancellorship,
          because unlike your simpleton King,
          they know that is the McCullen
          destiny, to run the wars, the true
          power, not simply to supply arms.

          WARDEN
          Do you have anything else to say
          before the sentence is carried out?

          MCCULLEN
          Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far
          bigger and more powerful than any
          of you could ever imagine. My sons
          will continue to rise along after I
          am gone. As will their sons. And,
          God willing, their sons.

          (SMILES)
          It shall not end with my death.
          The Warden smiles back sinisterly.

          WARDEN
          Oh, we're not going to kill you,
          McCullen. We're going to make an
          example of you.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          The Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the
          METALLIC OBJECT from the fire. McCullen sees what it is
          before we do and his face fills with fear. It's a METAL MASK
          being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous
          creak. McCullen begins to struggle against the rack.

          WARDEN (CONT'D)
          So that no man, woman, nor child
          may ever see your treacherous face
          again, you shall wear this mask for
          the term of your natural life.
          The mask closes around his face. The workers melt the lock.
          McCullen SCREAMS. AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE MEDALLION.

          EXT. NATO HEADQUARTERS - BRUSSELS - DAY

          The many flags of NATO flap outside its massive headquarters.

          SUPER: NATO HEADQUARTERS, BELGIUM

          MCCULLEN (V.0.)
          War used to be the exception. Now
          it is the new state of play, a
          constant, unavoidable...

          INT. BRIEFING CHAMBER - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The RED SQUARE MEDALLION around the neck of JAMES McCULLEN,
          gazing over a lectern in a darkened room. Like his doomed
          ancestor, McCullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes.

          MCCULLEN
          Tragic as they are to fight, wars
          must be won. But perhaps they don't
          have to be as destructive as
          they've been in the past.
          A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen
          behind him. McCullen is briefing twenty-two NATO MILITARY
          COMMANDERS, many of them listening in TRANSLATION HEADPHONES.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Nano-mites. Perfect little
          soldiers. Their size can be
          programmed as well as their
          intended task. Originally developed
          to isolate and destroy cancer
          cells, but at Mars Industries, and
          with the help of a little NATO
          funding...

          

          

          

          

          4.
          A few laughs around the room. McCullen soaks it up.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          .we discovered how to program
          them to eliminate most anything.
          For instance... metal.
          ON SCREEN: A SOLDIER fires a shoulder-launched missile at a
          tank. The warhead bursts into millions of SILVER MICROSCOPIC
          NANO-MITES which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a
          horse. Then the NANO-MITES fan out from the consumed tank and
          quickly head for a nearby jeep.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Once the target has been destroyed,
          the launcher triggers a kill switch
          unique to each warhead that short-
          circuits the nano-mites, preventing
          any unwanted destruction.
          ON SCREEN: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the launcher and
          the NANO-MITES instantly "drop dead" around the nearby jeep.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Each warhead contains seven million
          nano-mites and has the ability to
          eat anything from a single tank to
          an entire city.
          (to consummate salesman)
          But without innocent casualties.
          Which is why this has been such a
          priority for me and my company.
          The room breaks into APPLAUSE. FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a
          British veteran or countless battles, not buying it.

          HAWK
          Guess you'll be the first arms
          dealer up for the Nobel Peace
          Prize.
          Laughter in the room. McCullen smiles, being a good sport.

          MCCULLEN
          I prefer the term "armament
          solutions engineer"
          (more chuckles)
          Gentlemen! I'm pleased to announce
          that tomorrow morning your first
          order of nanotech warheads will
          ship from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          INT. MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          FOUR GLASS-LIKE WARHEADS, each the size of a softball, are
          placed into four separate compartments inside a WEAPONS CASE
          by a pair of LAB WORKERS. The KILL SWITCHES are secured next
          to each warhead. As the case is closed and locked we see the
          MARS Industries RED SQUARE MEDALLION LOGO on its cover.

          SUPER: KYRGYZSTAN, CENTRAL ASIA

          INT. MEN'S ROOM - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          A PAIR OF DOG TAGS drop INTO FRAME in SLOW MOTION. We see the
          name: "HAUSER, CONRAD R." Still not seeing his face, we watch
          our soldier strap into his BODY ARMOR and clip on his BATTLE
          HARNESS. His NAME TAG simply reads: "DUKE". He loads his into
          the mirror (is that a look of disdain?) and we get our first
          glimpse of our hero, a handsome, rugged combat veteran with a
          BATTLE SCAR under his right eye.
          The sound of RETCHING comes from the stall behind Duke. There
          is a flush and a strapping young Special Forces Soldier,
          STALWORTH, steps out. He goes to the sink next to Duke and
          splashes water on his face. He's pale and sweaty.

          DUKE
          The hell's wrong with you,
          Stalworth, you didn't eat that
          Chicken A La King at chow did ya?

          STALWORTH
          The mission, sir...

          DUKE
          What about it? Another day, another
          run.

          STALWORTH
          Never had anything to worry about
          before.
          Stalworth's shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to
          Duke: A YOUNG MOTHER with a NEWBORN in her arms.

          STALWORTH (CONT'D)
          Three weeks old. Be seeing him for
          the first time next leave.
          Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth. His eyes go
          distant thinking about his own past, then they harden again.

          

          

          

          

          6.

          DUKE
          You're off the mission.

          STALWORTH
          Sir?

          DUKE
          That's what you want, right?
          Stalworth doesn't argue. Duke hands him back the photo.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          If your head's with them, you're no
          good to me.
          Stalworth nods. Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          One thing, though: you step off
          this one, you're out of Special
          Forces. Gonna find you a nice desk
          and chair back at the base. You're
          be run of the mill. Regular.

          STALWORTH
          I... I guess I can live with that.

          DUKE
          Then you should.
          Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves. Duke's hard eyes
          watch him go, then a slight smile creases his lips ...

          INT. CORRIDOR - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen exits the briefing room into the corridor outside,
          shaking hands with various Military Commanders. Hawk watches
          with his aide, a gorgeous German Lieutenant, COURTNEY "COVER
          GIRL" KRIEGER. When McCullen is alone, Hawk makes his move.

          HAWK
          Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy,
          British Army.

          MCCULLEN
          (shaking hands)
          I know who you are General hawk. As
          sharp in a briefing room as your
          reputation is on the battlefield.

          

          

          

          

          7.

          HAWK
          Not hardly ...You gave me a broad
          target, I couldn't resist.

          MCCULLEN
          It's an honor to meet a man of your
          many accomplishments.
          McCullen smiles, then offers Hawk to walk with him.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          What's on your mind, General?

          HAWK
          Your warheads. Securing them in
          transit. Forty pairs of ears in
          that room now know the when and
          where.

          MCCULLEN
          Those "ears" all have top security
          clearance.

          HAWK
          We both know what that's worth.

          MCCULLEN
          Look, General, delivery is my
          responsibility and it's not one I
          take lightly. I had NATO assign an
          elite American Special Forces unit,
          a fully armored convoy with air
          support. I assure you, my warheads
          will be quite safe.

          HAWK
          I've made a career of showing up
          where I'm needed, whether ordered
          to or not. And if your warheads are
          half as effective as you say they
          are.. Then my unit is needed.

          MCCULLEN
          This is no time to play catch up.
          The NATO team's been drilling for
          weeks. They're lit up and ready to
          roll.

          HAWK
          My unit doesn't need mission
          specific training. They're chosen
          because of their ability to handle
          any situation.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          MCCULLEN
          Maybe next time, General...
          (moves to go, stops)
          What did you say your unit was
          called?

          HAWK
          I didn't. I just said they were
          always ready.
          McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a
          look, she reads it and nods. WE SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. HIGH-TECH DELIVERY BAY - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          A FOUR MAN SECURITY DETAIL escorts two LAB WORKERS as they
          enter a high-tech delivery bay and wlak past two "COUGAR"
          PATROL VEHICLES and a huge ARMORED "GRIZZLY TRUCK, all armed
          with state-of-the-art rooftop weapons. FIFTEEN SPECIAL FORCES
          SOLDIERS stand at attention in front of Duke.

          DUKE
          All right, listen up, the Cougars
          will be front and back, Grizzly in
          the middle carrying the package.
          Minimum distance at all times.
          Choppers will cover us overhead.
          The Lab Workers step up.

          LAB WORKER #1
          Captain Hauser.
          Duke turns to them and start signing forms as WALLACE
          "RIPCORD" WEEMS takes the case while a little short on
          academic credentials, Rip is long on confidence, charm, and
          courage. These two guys are as close as brothers, for better
          and for worse. Rip looks at the Lab Guy with a jokey grin.

          RIPCORD
          Not gonna explode, is it?

          LAB WORKER
          (dead serious)
          They're not weaponized yet. And the
          kill switches are attached to the
          launchers. All the same, I'd avoid
          potholes if I were you.
          Ripcord stares, then quickly hand the case off to another
          soldier. Duke shoots him a look and Ripcord shrugs, what?

          

          

          

          

          9.

          RIPCORD
          Why not stick it in a chopper and
          fly it out? If you want, I could--

          DUKE
          --We have our orders. Okay, people!
          We're on the clock, let's move.

          RIPCORD

          MOUNT UP!
          Duke gives Rip another look. Rip throws him a cheesy grin.
          The team mounts up. The weapons case to Grizzly. ENGINES
          ignite. HEADLIGHTS beam. And the convoy rolls out.

          EXT. MARS FACTORY - KYRGYZSTAN - NIGHT

          The convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates,
          passing a sign: "MILITARY ARMAMENTS RESEARCH SYNDICATE". Two
          BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS swoop in and follow the convoy.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT

          Ripcord drives the lead Cougar, Duke beside him. Two more
          guys in back, remotely panning a rooftop DUAL MACHINE GUN.

          DUKE
          (into radio)
          Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We
          have the package and are on the dot
          to make Ganci Air Base ar 0900.

          RIPCORD
          You know, I hate all the Mother
          Goose, bird Dog crap, I just wish
          they'd let us say, "Hey, Pete, it's
          Bill, see ya in a few."

          DUKE
          Not me, I joined up for the jargon.

          VOICE ON RADIO
          Roger that, Bird Dog. Mother Goose
          out.

          RIPCORD
          Just saying, you know, if I ran
          things...

          

          

          

          

          10.

          DUKE
          Rip, if you ran the Army we'd stay
          up all night, fill our canteen with
          tequila, and call each other "Bro".

          RIPCORD
          But we'd be badasses, right Bro?

          DUKE
          (with a sigh)
          Yeah, we'd be badasses. Eyes on the
          road, Rip.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

          The two Blackhawks sweep through the skies, silhouetted by
          the rising sun. Below them, the convoy is thundering down a
          winding road amid the magnificent Tian Shan Mountain Range.

          INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A RADAR DISH on the rear Cougar sweeps vigilantly. Inside, a
          SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER watches the RADAR MONITOR, clear
          except for two steady :signatures", the Blackhawks.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          In the lead Cougar, Duke and Ripcord keep their eyes out.

          RIPCORD
          Hey Duke, ya know how they always
          tell you to empty your head of
          distracting thoughts on these runs?

          DUKE
          Keep your eyes on the road, Rip.

          RIPCORD
          And you know how people sometimes
          joke that it must be easy fr me to
          keep my mind empty?

          DUKE
          Don't listen to 'em. you got plenty
          of thoughts up there.
          (into radio)
          Keep rear security tight, boys.

          

          

          

          

          11.

          RIPCORD
          Well, the second I try and make
          myself not have thoughts, I always
          have 'em. Like now, know what I'm
          thinking about?

          DUKE
          Please don't say the Air Forces.

          RIPCORD
          The Air Forces.

          DUKE
          I thought we were done with that
          discussion.

          RIPCORD
          You were done with it, not me.
          Look, I loev flying...
          Duke "mouths" the following sentence as Ropcord says it:

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          I've been flying since I was
          thirteen years old.
          Ripcord shoots him a look. Duke just smiles.

          DUKE
          I don't think your daddy's crop
          duster counts as hours logged.

          RIPCORD
          Jets, man, jets. You know I always
          qualify when I'm on leave.

          DUKE
          Yeah, yeah, look, you want to get
          up in the air, we'll get you a
          trampoline back at the base.

          RIPCORD
          We've done ten years in the Army, I
          just think we should see if the
          grass really is greener.

          DUKE
          This continues to be the stupidest
          idea you've ever come up with, nd
          that's saying something.

          RIPCORD
          Funny. Real funny.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          DUKE
          I don't wanna transfer to the Air
          Force, okay?

          RIPCORD
          It's always about you, isn't it?
          Give me one good reason?

          DUKE
          I want to be in the fight, not
          flying over it.

          RIPCORD
          Won't be saying that when you call
          in an air strike and I come
          screaming in to save your--

          DUKE
          --Eyes on the road, Rip.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Behind the Blackhawks and the convoy an ominous, DARK SHAPE
          suddenly drops INTO FRAME. ENGINE EXHAUST blurs our view of
          the aircraft, but we can tell that it's pursuing the convoy.

          INT./EXT. REAR COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          On the rear Cougar's RADAR SCREEN, we see the two Blackhawk
          signatures still appearing in position.. .but nothing else.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          They hit a pothole. Ripcord grimaces, then realizes--

          RIPCORD
          Hey, on the training run weren't
          there herders around here?
          This puts Duke instantly on the alert.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Too late. CONCUSSION CANNONS slide out of ports on both sides
          of the dark shape. They fire simultaneously. The SUBATOMIC
          BLASTS punch into the front Blackhawk, crushing it like a
          beer can on your forehead. It explodes and drops.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke and Rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of
          them, blocking the convoy's path. Rip hits the brakes.

          RIPCORD
          Jesus Christ! Bird Down!

          DUKE
          (urgent, but utterly calm)
          Back up! Back up! Back up!
          (into radio)
          Mother Goose, this is Bird Dog. We
          are under attack. Repeat --we are
          under attack!

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          The second Blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape, --it's
          like a giant helicopter without rotors, hovering on six JET
          THRUSTERS. It's a next-gen "TYPHOON" GUNSHIP.
          The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled MINI-
          GUNS. But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor.
          The CONCUSSION CANNONS fire at the second Blackhawk, catching
          it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending
          it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the
          rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy.
          The Grizzly launches two HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES off its roof-
          turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again. The
          blast lands directly on top of the rear Cougar, literally
          flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet.

          INT./EXT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke sees it all in his rear view mirror, yells into RADIO:

          DUKE
          Out! Everyone get out of the
          vehicles! Now!

          INT./EXT. GRIZZLY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A final CONCUSSION BLAST lands between the last two vehicles
          now. Spinning the Grizzly. It's WINDOWS SHATTER and a
          thousand lethal GLASS SHARDS shoot inside, killing the
          drivers. The Cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch.

          

          

          

          

          14.

          INT. LEAD COUGAR - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord land on the upturned ceiling, beat to shit.
          Duke quickly checks on the two guys in back crushed to death
          where the blast caved in the Cougar's armor. He looks at Rip.

          DUKE
          You okay?

          RIPCORD

          (DAZED)
          Yeah, except for all the blood.
          Duke sees blood on the back of Rip's head. Then they hear a
          LOUD ROAR and turn to see the Typhoon hover by the Grizzly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Who the hell is that?
          Duke grabs Ripcord and starts dragging him out.

          EXT. CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

          A SIDE DOOR on the Typhoon hisses open to reveal six
          "VIPERS", menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black
          BATTLE ARMOR, and armed with fearsome PULSE RIFLES. They exit
          the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left.
          The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly OPEN FIRE
          with ASSAULT RIFLES, but the bullets can't penetrate the
          Viers' armor. The Vipers fire back, the impact from their
          pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and
          fling them backwards.
          Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them
          toward the Typhoon. The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the
          air with their pulse rifles. It EXPLODES well out of range as
          the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the
          pack. Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six
          feet underground. A DULL WHOOMP, lifts the ground by a foot.
          Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon. Long,
          slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in
          black, form-fitting BODY ARMOR. She's beautiful, exotic, and
          most of all, lethal. She's known in certain circles only as
          "THE BARONESS" but we will know her as ANA. Her DARK GLASSES
          glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly.
          The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up
          to shoot her. But she quick-draws a pair of PULSE PISTOLS.
          BOOM! BOOM! The shots crush both soldiers.

          

          

          

          

          15.
          Ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a Viper blows
          the back door off the Grizzly, allowing her to climb inside.
          She blithely steps around the corpses and removes the WEAPONS

          CASE.
          Duke now has Rip ver his shouders and is running like hell.

          RIPCORD
          Duke?

          DUKE
          Shut up.

          RIPCORD
          If I die...

          DUKE
          You're not gonna die.

          RIPCORD
          I just want you to know... you never
          could run worth a damn.

          DUKE
          Jesus, Rip.

          RIPCORD
          I'm just saying, it's be nice if
          you could move a little faster.
          And that's when the Cougar blows, a concussive blast. Ana
          turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go
          ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of
          her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke.
          DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.

          DUKE
          Stay here.

          RIPCORD
          (really messed up)
          Sure.

          DUKE
          I'm gettin' that package.
          Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs
          up the embankment. --And comes face to face with a Viper, who
          raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away. A hand
          clamps down over the barrel.
          The Viper looks at Ana beside him. Duke also looks at her, a
          flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face.

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the DARK LENSES turn
          clear, revealing her gorgeous eyes.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          What the hell...?
          Her face softens hesitantly.

          ANA
          Hello, Duke...
          Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face,
          knocks him out on his ass.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          You have to admit you had that
          coming.
          Ana struggles with something going on inside her head. Then
          her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the
          first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Good-bye, Duke.
          Duke can't believe it. Ana suddenly glances up at something
          behind Duke. It's a "HOWLER" TRANSPORT rocketing onto the
          scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety degrees
          to slow it into a hover. Duke takes the opportunity to jump
          to his feet and lay out in the Viper. Ana turns and hauls-
          ass.
          A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and
          lands behind a Viper and SNAPS his neck. Moving in a blur, he
          draws and buries a KATANA BLADE into another Viper. Then he
          glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far
          away to reach with his sword. He quick-draws a GLOCK PISTOL.
          BAM! Right between the eye slit in his helmet. All this in
          the space of six breathless seconds.
          Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES
          sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking
          Glock. RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep. Bad-ass
          defined. Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse
          burst just missed him. Duke immediately takes off after Ana,
          his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, PULSE
          BURSTS crackling past his head. He curses under his breath:

          DUKE
          Air Force.. .right.

          

          

          

          

          17.
          A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips
          through his eye-slit and ELECTROCUTES him, courtesy of SHANA
          "SCARLETT" O'HARA who fast-ropes down from the Howler,
          holding a gas-propulsion CROSSBOW PISTOL. She lines up on
          another Viper, but he's too quick, ducks behind the GRIZZLY.
          But Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL viewfinder snapped an image of
          his FACE ARMOR. She darts behind the COUGAR WRECK with Snake-
          Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's
          LED SCREEN. Then she fires behind her, in the complete other
          direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns
          around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover,
          the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit.
          Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but
          LAMONT "HEAVY DUTY" MORRIS leans out of the landing Howler
          holding a dual MACHINE GUN/GRENADE LAUNCHER. Only a man this
          big can carry such a weapon.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Time to lay down some bass!
          He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME. You
          blink, you miss it. BOOM! The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty,
          but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its LEFT-SIDE
          THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side. The CONCUSSION BLASTS
          whip past and decimate the forest behind it. Hanging
          awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades.
          The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air.
          The Howler fires MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS
          and rip them apart. The Typhoon SHAKES. Ana races for the
          recovering Typhoon. Duke races after her through a hail of
          pulse-fire and draws his PISTOL.

          DUKE
          Ana!
          She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest
          and face, using it as a shield. Duke hesitates, because of
          the warheads or Ana? Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.

          SCARLETT
          The warheads!
          Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana
          backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon. Duke charges like a
          bull and tackles her. Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free.
          Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes
          after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray
          gunfire her way. Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon,
          which is raked by the bullets.

          

          

          

          

          18.
          Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky
          and disappears over a rise ...
          SILENCE... Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach
          Duke, who whirls around at them, pistol up, eyes wild.

          DUKE
          Stand down! Stand the hell down!

          HEAVY DUTY
          Lower your weapon, Sir. We're not
          the enemy.

          DUKE
          Pointing weapons at me doesn't make
          you my friend.
          ABEL "BREAKER" SHAZ jumps out of the Howler wearing a
          computerized SURVEILLANCE SUIT, a French/Tunisian ACCENT:

          BREAKER
          Please hand over the case, sir.

          DUKE
          I don't know who you are, and I
          sure as hell don't know who they
          are, and until I find out, I'm not
          lowering anything or handling
          anything over.
          CLICK-CLACK. They turn to see Ripcord shouldering a rifle.

          RIPCORD
          What's your unit?

          SCARLETT
          That's classified.
          Snake-Eyes discreetly grabs SHRUNKEN THROWING STARS from his
          belt, but a look from Scarlett makes him out them back.

          BREAKER
          Someone would like a word with you.
          Breaker sets a holo-projector on the ground in front of Duke,
          which projects a 3D IMAGE OF GENERAL HAWK. Duke is stunned.

          HAWK
          State you name and rank.

          DUKE
          .you first.

          

          

          

          

          19.

          HAWK
          My team just saved your life. now's
          the part where you say "thank you".

          DUKE
          Those aren't the words that come to
          mind just now. We weren't told
          about any support for this mission,
          so you better tell your team to
          stand down.
          Ripcord eyes his sight.

          RIPCORD
          Happy to turn this into a turkey
          shoot.
          Someone OFF-PROJECTOR hands Hawk a file, he looks at it.

          HAWK
          You must be... Ripcord, expert
          marksman, weapons specialist, jet

          QUALIFIED--

          RIPCORD
          (to Duke)
          Told ya.

          HAWK
          I'm General Clayton Abernathy. You
          may have heard of me, .Duke.
          A glint of recognition flickers across Duke's eyes, he nods.

          DUKE
          General hawk. Afghanistan, NATO
          Forward Command...
          Breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to Duke and
          starts sweeping a scanner across the case. Hawk smiles.

          HAWK
          That was my last job.
          (a twinkle in his eye)
          I'm in a whole new outfit now.
          Duke swivels his gun to Breaker's head. Breaker flinches.

          BREAKER
          Just need to deactivate its
          tracking beacon, for security.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          HAWK
          Hand over the weapons case son, and
          let us deliver the warheads.

          DUKE
          No way. I signed for 'em. My
          mission, my package. I carry them,
          I deliver them.
          Breaker's scanner BEEPS. He keys a button. The BEEPING
          promptly stops. He throws a look at Duke.

          BREAKER
          Wasn't hard, was it?

          DUKE
          Fine. But you seem to be a little
          short on transportation a the
          moment. Team Alpha will deliver you
          to me.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          And where exactly are you, General?

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Hawk stands in front of a HOLO-CAM amongst a sea of
          computers, Cover Girl behind him, Duke on a monitor.

          HAWK
          Come see for yourself.

          EXT. HOWLER - EGYPTIAN SKIES - DUSK

          The Howler skims over the GIANT PYRAMIDS OF GIZA, a caravan
          of camels below. The aircraft continues out into the golden
          desert, too fast for anybody to get a good look at it.

          INT. HOWLER -SKIES - DUSK

          Scarlett is cleaning Ripcord's head wound.

          RIPCORD
          Hey, you're cute.

          SCARLETT
          He's going into shock.

          RIPCORD
          What's your name, darlin'?

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Snake-Eyes stabs Ripcord hard int he arm with a drip-needle,
          Rip angrily eyeballs him and stifles a scream.

          SCARLETT
          I thought all the Special Ops guys
          were tough.

          RIPCORD
          We are tough ... . but also sensitive.
          (feeling the drugs)
          Whoa, that's some mucho primo stuff
          you gave me.
          Rip is high now, his eyes float up to Heavy Duty who stares
          back at him. Rip reaches out to touch his well-cropped hair.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          .and a kung-fu grip.

          HEAVY DUTY
          The name's Heavy Duty.
          Duke has the weapons case on his lap.

          DUKE
          What kind of outfit is this? Not
          regular Army based on the accents.
          (to Scarlett)
          I have you as an Aussie...
          (looks to Heavy Duty)
          And you're a Johannesburger...
          (then Breaker)
          And you: French North Africa.
          Algiers?

          BREAKER
          Tunisia. Where were you born?

          RIPCORD
          Are you kidding me? Duke wasn't
          born, he was Government-Issued!

          DUKE
          But somehow you're all in the same
          unit. One you can't tell me the
          name of right?

          SCARLETT
          We'd get tossed for telling.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          RIPCORD
          Duke, Duke, don't you get it:
          they're super secret, they're
          Mission Impossible. This tape's
          gonna self-destruct in five--

          DUKE
          --You're gonna go after them aren't
          you? The ones that hit my convoy.

          (SILENCE)
          Then whoever you are, whatever this
          unit is, I want in.

          BREAKER
          Not our call.
          Ripcord sits up, really woozy, looks at Scarlett.

          RIPCORD
          I want in too. That way we can
          spend some bunker time together.
          A SWORD suddenly slices across Rip's face, an inch away. It's
          Snake-Eyes, checking his blade, seemingly innocent. But the
          message is not lost on Ripcord. Scarlett looks at Duke.

          SCARLETT
          You two a team or something?

          RIPCORD
          We've been together forever.
          (off her look)
          But not like that. Hi, I'm Ripcord.

          SCARLETT
          Why do they call you that?
          Breaker laughs, reading Ripcord's file:

          BREAKER
          Because his name is Wallace Weems!

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Eight SECURITY TECHNICIANS sit around an island console in a
          small, windowless room. Working their keyboards and watching
          the HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE of the Howler soaring across the dunes.
          A technician hits a LARGE SWITCH on his console.

          SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1
          Alpha-One, this is Base. You are
          cleared or entry.

          

          

          

          

          23.

          EXT. HOWLER - SKIES - DAY

          And a huge sand dune directly in front of Howler spirals open
          to reveal a CAVERNOUS HOLE. The Howler's THRUSTERS twist
          vertical and it drops like a helicopter into the hole.
          SUPER: Global Integrated Joint Operating Entity.

          INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY

          The Howler descends beneath the surface onto a dark platform
          as the roof spirals shut and FLOOD LIGHTS switch on. The door
          of the howler opens and the team steps out. Duke and Ripcord
          follow hesitantly with the weapons case. A VOICE calls out to
          them from the shadows:

          HAWK (O.S.)
          Welcome to the new Pit!
          Duke and Ripcord turn to see hawk and Cover girl walking out
          from behind the lights.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          Duke.

          DUKE
          General.

          HAWK
          I've read a lot about you two.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, look, I didn't "steal" that
          Blackhawk, I was borrowing it...
          Duke shoots him a look. Hawk steps right up to Duke.

          HAWK
          Matter of fact, I saw that one of
          my subordinates tried to recruit
          you to our little operation a while
          back.

          DUKE
          I was never asked to join any Op
          group.

          HAWK
          Remember a tall gentleman
          approaching you in Thailand when
          you were on leave, four years ago?

          

          

          

          

          24.

          DUKE
          Vaguely.

          HAWK
          Right before you tore up the bar?

          RIPCORD
          Four years? My man had some issues.
          Duke shoots him another look, then turns back to Hawk.

          DUKE
          This doesn't look like any Tac Op
          I've ever seen. Where are we?

          HAWK
          Okay, you trusted me by going with
          my team, so I'll trust you.
          There's a loud METALLIC CLANG and part of the PLATFORM begins
          to descend. They pass the URBAN COMBAT LEVEL where MEN and
          WOMEN are training with next-gen urban warfare equipment.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          Technically, GI JOE doesn't exist.
          But if it did, it'd be comprised of
          the top men and women from the best
          military units all over the world.
          The alpha dogs...
          They see a pretty woman sip into a next-gen CAMO-SUIT, which
          reflects and refracts light, making her nearly invisible.

          RIPCORD
          Oh man, I want one of those.

          BREAKER
          The suit or the girl?

          RIPCORD
          Both.
          Scarlett's eyes roll. They descend into the DESERT COMBAT
          level, where soldiers train with desert warfare equipment.

          HAWK
          Ten nations signed on in their
          first year. Working together,
          sharing intel. Now we have twenty-
          three.

          

          

          

          

          25.

          DUKE
          I've never seen combat gear this
          sleek, what's the trick?

          SCARLETT
          Liquid armor.
          They reach the DEEP SEA COMBAT LEVEL where dozens of men and
          women are testing fantastic next-gen UNDERWATER VEHICLES.

          HAWK (O.S.)
          Good news is we've been pretty
          successful so far. The bad news is
          whenever we manage to shut down one
          organization, another springs up in
          its place.

          RIPCORD
          Who could possibly fund all this?

          HEAVY DUTY
          Oprah.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Hawk now leads the group into the Control Room where more
          TECHNICIANS man consoles. Duke still has the weapons case.

          CONTROL ROOM TECHNICIAN #1
          Mr. McCullen's standing by, Sir.

          HAWK
          Patch him through, please.

          DUKE
          So who hit us out there?

          COVER GIRL
          Currently unidentified.

          HEAVY DUTY
          And how'd that bitch in leather get
          a jump jet like ours?

          SCARLETT
          Whoever she is, she's clearly well-
          financed, with access to highly
          classified intel and state of the
          art weaponry. Their capabilities
          are beyond anything we've ever
          encountered.

          

          

          

          

          26.

          RIPCORD
          That's the reason we got our asses
          kicked.
          Duke betrays nothing. Hawk looks at him.

          HAWK
          We're going to need to find out
          everything we can about her.
          Knowing is half the battle.

          RIPCORD
          What's the other half?
          McCullen now appears next to Ripcord and walks through him.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Jesus!
          And we realize McCullen is here courtesy of a HOLO-PROJECTOR.
          A ring of cameras provides him with images of the Joes.

          HAWK
          Gentlemen, this is James McCullen,
          CEO of MARS Industries, the man who
          built these warheads.
          WE INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH McCullen standing in front of a
          HOLO-CAM in a small room somewhere. THE HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGES of
          hawk, Duke, and the others around him.

          MCCULLEN
          General, most men I've encountered
          in this business over-promise and
          under-deliver. You're the opposite.
          Clearly, you were the security
          option I should have chosen.
          ON DUKE: Steaming behind his military demeanor.

          DUKE
          My team did everything we could out
          there. A lot of good men went down--

          MCCULLEN
          --But not you.

          DUKE
          That mission was classified, sir.
          Clearly, somebody sold us out.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          MCCULLEN
          I've spent ten years and thirteen
          billion Euros creating these four
          warheads. Your job, Captain, was to
          protect them, and if it wasn't for
          General Hawk, you would've failed.

          HAWK
          That's not a fair assessment. He
          followed his orders to the letter.

          MCCULLEN
          Well that wasn't enough.
          Duke bristles. McCullen turns to Hawk.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          What are your coordinates? I'll
          have NATO send another special ops
          team to retrieve the warheads,
          company strength this time.

          HAWK
          Apologizes, Mr McCullen. It's not
          that I don't trust you...I don't
          trust anybody.

          MCCULLEN

          (SMILES)
          Are you sure you're not a McCullen?

          HAWK
          I don't talk smooth enough to be a
          McCullen.

          MCCULLEN
          You do just fine, General. Now, so
          the bastards who attacked you can't
          find you, you need to disable the
          tracking beacon hidden in the case.

          BREAKER
          We already have.

          MCCULLEN
          Good man. So, can I count on you to
          deliver the warheads to NATO now?

          HAWK
          I think it unwise to expose them at
          the moment. This group might make
          another attempt.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          28.

          HAWK (CONT'D)
          We need to find and neutralize them
          before we can consider moving your
          weapons.

          MCCULLEN
          Alright. But allow me to check the
          warheads to see if any have been
          damaged.
          Duke begrudgingly sets the case down. Breaker turns on his
          suit's BALL-EYEPIECE. It goes into X-RAY MODE and we see the
          NANO-MITES crawling around inside the four warheads.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Open it, please.

          BREAKER
          My scan says they're intact...

          MCCULLEN
          General?

          HAWK
          What's the code?
          ON DUKE, listening carefully.

          MCCULLEN
          Five-two-nine-four-four-oh.
          Breaker enters the code. As the case opens, Breaker
          discreetly watches McCullen in his BALL-EYEPIECE SCANNER.
          McCullen runs his holographic fingers over the warheads.
          Satisfied, he turns to Hawk.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Please keep me informed of your
          progress, General.
          Duke and McCullen share a quick glare. And then McCullen cuts
          the feed. Scarlett notices concern on Breaker's face.

          SCARLETT
          Breaker?

          BREAKER
          That bloke's Beta waves were going
          up, down, and sideways... I think
          he's hiding something.
          And off the faces of the rest of the group WE CUT BACK TO:

          

          

          

          

          29.

          INT./EXT TRIDENT - DAY

          McCullen turns as Ana appears on a HOLO-PROJECTOR behind him.

          MCCULLEN
          I spend five years setting this up.
          Wringing money out of NATO. This
          was supposed to be the easy part.

          ANA
          If you'd let me stage the assault
          at your precious factory, we could
          have contained the situation.

          MCCULLEN
          And lost the trust of our clients
          in the process? It had to be NATO's
          fault.
          (steps closer)
          What happened? Did you hesitate?

          ANA
          You're implying this was about some
          ancient history? That's as
          laughable as your Intel. What went
          wrong was the Joes appearing out of
          nowhere.
          He stares at her suspiciously, then softens.

          MCCULLEN
          Forgive me, jealousy isn't my
          strong suit.

          ANA
          Forget that, where are we now? Have
          you tracked the case?

          MCCULLEN
          They deactivated the beacon. I gave
          them a code to quietly re-arm it.
          McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on, displaying A MAP
          OF THE WORLD. A BEACON LIGHT flashes over a spot in the
          Egyptian desert, grip coordinates blinking.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          There it is. The infamous Pit.

          ANA
          I will get those warheads back.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          McCullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face, his
          hand going right through her. McCullen whispers menacingly.

          MCCULLEN
          I hope so.

          ANA
          (diffusing the threat)
          If I were really there, I might
          actually let you touch me.

          MCCULLEN
          (sly smile)
          I'll send a jet.

          ANA
          Business first. Besides, I'm
          married, remember?
          Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.

          MCCULLEN
          Sometimes I really hate technology.
          He sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:

          STORM SHADOW (O.S.)
          It is most often used by those
          without honor.
          McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean
          man whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other
          side of the room.

          MCCULLEN
          There can't be any more mistakes.
          The schedule can't be compromised
          any further.

          STORM SHADOW
          If you had sent me, it would be
          done.

          MCCULLEN
          (walking towards him)
          I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.
          To the Baroness's villa. .Make
          sure her commitment doesn't waiver.
          Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him. We now
          realize Storm Shadow was a holo-proj. Storm Shadow vanishes.

          

          

          

          

          31.
          McCullen steps up to a large oval perspex window. WE PULL
          BACK out of the window to reveal that he's riding through
          DEEP ARCTIC OCEAN inside a next-gen "TRIDENT" submarine.
          CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK to show the Trident approaching the
          docking bay of a MASSIVE FACILITY built into the seabed under
          the jagged canopy of the POLAR ICE CAP. The place is defended
          by several HARPOON CANNONS and a fearsome TURBO-LASER. It's a
          breath-taking sight, but also a little frightening.

          INT. DOCKING BAY - DAY

          The MARS LOGO is stamped on a pair of WATER-TIGHT DOORS. The
          logo pulls apart as the doors open, allowing McCullen inside
          the docking back entrance. Waiting for him is a man known
          only as THE DOCTOR. His face hidden by a life-support mask
          that continually pumps air into his lungs and also
          mechanically helps him to speak without the vocal chords he
          is missing.

          THE DOCTOR
          Welcome back.

          MCCULLEN
          Good to be back.

          THE DOCTOR
          we've been very busy.
          He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all
          standing at attention, not a single muscle moving among them.
          These are NEO-VIPERS. The baddest of the bad.

          MCCULLEN
          Is it working?

          THE DOCTOR
          You tell me.
          The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a
          glass case containing an eighteen foot long KING COBRA. the
          Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          The King Cobra is a magnificent
          creature. Its venom can kill a
          full grown elephant with a single
          bite.
          He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing
          its hood. The Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows
          McCullen an INCISION SCAR behind the Neo-Vipers' right ears.

          

          

          

          

          32.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          We introduced into each subject one
          thousand cc's of the nano-mite
          solution. As expected, subjects
          became extremely ill and fell into
          a coma-like state for approximately
          forty hours.
          The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket,
          A FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device's screen.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          When they returned to sentience,
          brain scans showed complete
          inactivity in the self-preservation
          region of the cortex.

          MCCULLEN
          English, Doctor.
          The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps
          up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal.

          THE DOCTOR
          They feel no fear.
          The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites
          his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins. The
          Neo-Viper doesn't even wince.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Cortical nerve clusters revealed
          complete inactivity--

          MCCULLEN
          --Doctor.

          THE DOCTOR
          They feel no pain.
          The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently
          lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Frontal lobe concepts of morality
          are disengaged... No remorse...

          MCCULLEN
          And they are completely obedient?

          THE DOCTOR
          Of course. .The real world
          applications are endless.

          

          

          

          

          33.
          The Neo-Viper's knees give out. McCullen watches curiously.
          WE SMASH CUT INTO the NEO-VIPER'S BITE WOUND where the WHITE
          VENOM is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins.

          THE DOCTOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The nano-mites will target the
          venom.
          STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES
          rushing to meet the venom head on. Blocking it.
          Then swiftly pushing it back. All the way to the original
          fang holes. The venom seeps out of the holes and drips off
          the Neo-Viper's arm. He stands and returns to his place in
          line without a word. The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          So you tell me: is it working?

          INT. CORRIDORS - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors.

          THE DOCTOR
          The science is staggering isn't it?

          MCCULLEN
          You've done well. You've thrown the
          caber clear out of the yard.

          THE DOCTOR
          But research and science are
          expensive propositions. If I can
          make a suggestion..?
          McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly
          menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Selling one batch of warheads on
          the black market could fund--

          MCCULLEN
          --I appreciate your thirst for
          knowledge, Doctor. But this world
          is messy enough. Factions fighting
          and scrabbling for control, for
          resources, and it's only going to
          get worse as the century
          progresses. No. What the world
          needs is unification. Leadership.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          34.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          It needs to be taken out of chaos
          by someone with complete control.
          He looks through a portal into a shadowy OPERATING CHAMBER,
          where a brilliant but vicious looking MAN is being scanned by
          SMART ROBOTS. This is ZARTAN. A Smart Robot begins to change
          Zartan's fingerprints, which we see on a monitor.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          My family was once this close to
          that kind of power...

          (LAUGHS)
          The French...
          Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod. McCullen
          looks back at the Doctor.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Once I get my hands on the reins,
          the money will take care of itself.
          You'll be able to do all the
          research you want.
          McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          Duke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a PHOTO OF ANA
          from the ambush, now up on a monitor.

          BREAKER
          We grabbed an image from Heavy-
          Duty's helmet cam.
          Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers:

          RIPCORD
          Hey, that's--
          Duke cuts him off with a look. Breaker extracts a full 3D
          FRONT-VIEW of Ana's face from the photo. Then on an adjacent
          monitor, he runs an endless series of PHOTOS OF WOMEN.

          BREAKER
          Now we can run the face through an
          infinity scan.

          HAWK
          We have access to any photograph on
          any server anywhere in the world.

          

          

          

          

          35.

          BREAKER
          Everyone gets photographed in some
          way at some time. ATM machines,
          airports, crowd shots at a football
          game. We'll find her.
          Duke just stares at Ana's photo. Ripcord whispers quietly:

          RIPCORD
          You okay?

          DUKE
          (not okay)
          .what happened to her?
          For once, Ripcord doesn't know what to say. Cover Girl walks
          in and hands a document to Hawk, who looks through it.

          HAWK
          From NATO. I am now the official
          custodian of the warheads. Your
          mission is complete. Once you hand
          it over, that is.
          Duke nods, hands over the case with a hint of defeat.

          DUKE
          When you move it, she's gonna come
          after you, you know that, right?
          (off Hawk's look)
          And with her Intel, and her toys...
          she'll find you.

          HAWK
          And your point is...?

          DUKE
          You're going to go after her first.
          And I want to help.

          RIPCORD
          Let us in on this, General. Our
          team just got wasted. I think a
          little payback is in order.

          HAWK
          You don't ask to be a part of GI
          JOE. You get asked.

          DUKE
          You scouted me four years ago, now
          I'm ready. Let's have at it.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HAWK
          I've lost men too, Captain. Good
          men. But attempting to--

          DUKE
          I know her.

          HAWK
          Excuse me?

          DUKE
          You said knowing is half the
          battle. Well, I know who she is.
          Duke reaches into his pocket, pulls out a photo and shows
          Hawk. INSERT PHOTO: Ana, four years earlier, much softer
          looking, staring lovingly at Duke as they're about to kiss.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Her name is Ana Lewis, and I can
          tell you everything you need to
          know about her until... four years
          ago. After that, well, obviously
          sa lot's changed.
          Hawk just stares in disbelief.

          INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - DAY

          Hawk sits down behind his desk and looks up at Duke, still
          standing at attention.

          HAWK
          Before this goes any further, I
          need to know what I'm dealing with,
          a man looking to settle a score, or
          a man who can put the mission
          first. Because the battlefield is
          the wrong place for emotion.
          (he pauses for effect)
          Could you kill her?

          DUKE
          If I had to.

          HAWK
          Chances are you will. But if you
          flinch, hesitate even an instant...
          what I'm trying to say is, unless
          you can kill her graveyard dead I
          don't want you.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          DUKE
          I can.
          (off Hawk's look)
          I signed on to deliver those
          warheads, General, and despite your
          present authority, I want to finish
          the job.
          Hawk regards him for a moment.

          HAWK
          So tell me about her.

          DUKE
          Okay, I'll start right here: I hope
          that vault is tight, because she
          always gets what she wants...

          EXT. THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT

          A BLACK, BEEFED-UP SUV drives towards a magnificent mansion
          in the Parisian suburbs. Though the vehicle looks relatively
          harmless, we'll come to know it as a "SCARAB" attack truck.

          SUPER: PARIS, FRANCE

          INT. FOYER - THE BARONESS' MANSION - PARIS - NIGHT

          Ana enters the mansion. SERVANTS take her coat as her
          handsome, sophisticated and well dressed husband, BARON LEON
          DECOBRAY, glides up to her, very French. They kiss warmly.

          DECOBRAY
          Hello, darling.

          ANA
          How is work at the lab?

          DECOBRAY
          Steady progress.

          ANA
          So the Minister of Defense was
          pleased?

          DECOBRAY
          He was. You know I wish I could
          tell you more...

          ANA
          Of course.

          

          

          

          

          38.

          DECOBRAY
          You were gone a long time. How
          were the shops in Monte Carlo?

          ANA
          I didn't get what I was after.
          They head up the stairs.

          DECOBRAY
          I suppose I should be grateful.

          ANA
          Most husbands would be.

          DECOBRAY
          Most husbands don't have such
          mysterious wives, they know exactly
          where they are and what they do.

          ANA

          (TEASING)
          They think they know.

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE BARONESS' CASTLE - NIGHT

          Ana throws open the double doors to her grand bedroom on a
          high floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower.

          ANA
          I never get over how beautiful...

          DECOBRAY
          (staring at Ana)
          Neither do I.
          She spots Storm Shadow standing in an ante room and quickly
          spins to face her husband. She pulls Decobray close and
          kisses him. Storm Shadow makes a move, but ana warns him off
          with her eyes, She finishes the kiss and looks at Decobray.

          ANA
          Let me change and freshen up and
          I'll meet you for dinner.

          DECOBRAY
          Of course.
          Decobray smiles at her and leaves. The smile falls from
          Ana's face as she spins around and heads for Storm Shadow.

          

          

          

          

          39.

          STORM SHADOW
          Mr. McCullen gave me explicit
          orders to sever the Baron's spine
          if he so much as touched you.

          ANA
          He's my husband, of course he
          touches me. Tell McCullen to grow
          up. Besides, the Baron says his
          work in the lab goes much better
          after we've... touched. And that's
          the important thing.

          STORM SHADOW
          I'll be accompanying you to
          retrieve the warheads this time.
          Along with some of the men the
          Doctor's been working on.

          ANA
          (with distaste)
          The Doctor.

          STORM SHADOW
          We go at dawn.
          Storm Shadow turns and heads out through the doors. Ana
          Stands alone in her room now, she heads over to her dresser
          and opens a hidden drawer. Inside is a SMALL BOX. She opens
          it carefully and gazes at an ENGAGEMENT RING inside.
          Something sad and lonely in her eyes... And WE FLASHBACK TO:

          INT. MILITARY CLUB - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

          A crowded military club. OFFICERS and ENLISTED dancing to an
          orchestra. And there's Ana, the most beautiful woman in the
          room. Wearing a black dress. Slightly younger and with none
          of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier. She's dancing
          with Duke who's wearing his officer's DRESS UNIFORM, replete
          with bars and medals. She laughs as Duke whispers something
          in her ear. She's in love. And so is he.
          Ripcord is in a booth, downing shots with four ENLISTED
          WOMEN. He has his arms around two of them and looks loaded.

          RIPCORD
          My hot tub only holds four.

          (COUNTS)
          No, five.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          EXT. VERANDAH - OFFICER'S CLUB - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

          Duke leads Ana outside onto a quiet verandah, the lights of
          Washington shimmering beyond them. He suddenly kneels down
          in front of her, an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box in his hand.
          Ana gasps with shock and joy, tears welling in her eyes.

          DUKE
          I've been wanting to do this before
          we deploy.

          ANA
          Duke...it's beautiful. It's too
          nice you lunatic.

          DUKE
          Only time I'm buying one of these,
          so why not?
          They stare a each other, a touching beat. Then Duke screws
          up his face, worried?

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Well, what do you say?
          She's too emotional to speak. And then they hear:

          REX (O.S.)
          Say yes, you idiot...!
          Lieutenant REX LEWIS saunters up, MEDICAL INSIGNIA on his
          collar. The look on his face tells us he's happy for them.

          REX (CONT'D)
          .Before I tell my new brother-in-
          law what it's like to share a
          bathroom with you.

          DUKE
          Thanks for killing the mood, Rex.

          REX
          I was coming to offer you a ride
          back to post.

          ANA
          Time already?

          DUKE
          We go at oh-five hundred.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          ANA
          Is it WMDs? It is, right? That's
          why you're pulling Rex out of the

          LAB--

          DUKE
          Ana, we can't--

          ANA
          Yeah, yeah. Classified. Top
          Secret. Have to kill me if you
          told me, blah, blah, blah.

          DUKE
          Speaking of classified information,
          you still haven't answered.

          ANA
          Yes. Of course it's yes. On one

          CONDITION--
          She grabs REX and pulls him down on his knees next to Duke.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Promise me that you won't let my
          genius egghead brother get hurt.
          (looks at Rex)
          He's the only family I've got left.
          (back to Duke)
          Promise me.

          DUKE
          I promise.
          She smiles and holds out her hand. He threads the ring onto
          her trembling finger. Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint
          of instability. Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through shuttered
          doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Jesus, Rip.
          Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:

          RIPCORD
          How was I supposed know she was
          married!?
          (then, notices the ring)
          Nice rock! Hey, are you proposing?

          DUKE
          I'm done proposing.

          

          

          

          

          42.

          ANA
          I already said yes.

          RIPCORD
          Not official until you answer my
          question. Do you love my boy?

          ANA
          Always and forever.
          Ripcord flips open his CELL PHONE and takes the photo of Ana
          that Duke carries with him.

          RIPCORD
          Now I've gotta find someone to love
          me, as many times as possible for
          the next three hours.
          WE PUSH IN ON THE PHOTO, then SMASH CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

          INT. THE PIT - URBAN ENVIRONMENT - DAY

          On Duke, watching Heavy Duty pulling out an ACCELERATOR SUIT.

          HEAVY DUTY
          If you want to join us, you'll need
          to be mission ready, Joe style.
          This is the Mark One Accelerator
          Suit.

          RIPCORD
          What's it accelerate?

          HEAVY DUTY
          You. It'll make you run faster,
          jump higher, and hit harder than
          any of your enemies.
          A TITANIUM BOOT slides over a shoe. COBALT MACHINE PARTS
          snap into place with a HISS over Duke and Rip's arms and
          legs.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          Head-to-toe turbo-hydraulics and
          highly-pressurized pneumatics.
          They both slap on aerodynamic, flying-wing HELMETS. Inside,
          the CYBERNETIC POWER-UP with an ear piercing whine. LASER
          ENHANCED LED readouts scramble and fritz across their HUDs.

          

          

          

          

          43.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          An advanced cybernetics heads-up
          display, feeding into your helmet.
          Duke checks out two gas-propelled GRAPPLING SPEARS and six
          WRIST ROCKETS around his right forearm.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          Two gas propelled grappling spears
          and six ten millimeter, hi-
          explosive, heat seeking, fire-and-
          forget rockers.
          Rip spins the twin barrels of a caseless SUBMACHINE GUN on
          his left forearm. A Cheshire grin spreads across his face.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          And a nine millimeter, caseless
          submachine gun with six hundred
          rounds capable of firing all of
          them in thirty seconds.
          Duke and Ripcord are now buckled in, getting a feel for the
          FLEXIBLE, POLY-ALLOY SUITS. Ripcord glances at Heavy Duty.

          RIPCORD
          I just missed everything you said.
          (turns to Duke)
          How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?

          INT. TARGET RANGE - URBAN COMBAT LEVEL - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord run through and URBAN ENVIRONMENT OBSTACLE
          COURSE, 3D HOLO-PROJECTION TERRORISTS lunging out at them.
          The guys take them out one by one, never more than a split
          second after they appear. The HOLO-PROJECTIONS fritz and
          die. They reach the end of the and a BUZZER SOUNDS. At the
          back, arms crossed, impassively taking it all in, is Hawk.
          Scarlett approaches the guys with an ELECTRONIC CLIPBOARD.

          SCARLETT
          Sixty-three seconds. Not Bad. But
          not good enough. Gotta get under a
          minute to qualify.

          DUKE
          What's the record?

          SCARLETT
          Forty-five.

          

          

          

          

          44.

          RIPCORD
          Don't tell me, Snake-Eyes?

          SCARLETT
          No, me.
          Ripcord glances at Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL.

          RIPCORD
          You can do this whole course with
          that thing in forty-five seconds?

          SCARLETT
          If you're going to shoot at
          something, kill it. Otherwise take
          up knitting.

          RIPCORD
          When I want something, I don't just
          shoot at it...
          (steps close to her)
          When I get a target in my sights, I
          take it down.
          His meaning is clear. She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine
          into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and hands it to him.

          SCARLETT
          Here. Go on. Try it.

          RIPCORD
          I wouldn't want to show you up.

          SCARLETT
          Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.

          RIPCORD
          What can I tell you? I guess I'm
          just a considerate, humble guy.
          You'll learn that about me.

          SCARLETT
          I'm the "target in your sights,"
          right? You've got ten rounds to
          "take me down".

          RIPCORD
          I don't want to hurt you.

          SCARLETT
          They're training arrows. The most
          I'll feel is a little jolt.

          

          

          

          

          45.
          Scarlett walks back and faces him. He glances aside at Duke
          who is loving this. Ripcord readies the pistol. Scarlett
          darts left. He shoots and misses. She darts right. He
          misses.

          DUKE
          C'mon, Rip.
          Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best. But Scarlett
          us too fast. Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble
          as a cat. Five more shots miss her. And now Ripcord's
          feeling the pressure. He waits for her to move. Fires. She
          leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath.
          He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to
          him. He fires his last bolt point blank. She catches it in
          her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber. Slamming
          her body up against his. Right hand behind his head, left
          hand holding the bolt. Their faces close. Lips closer.
          Ripcord's eyes on hers as he whispers:

          SCARLETT
          Guess you didn't really want me
          that bad, rip.
          She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she
          walks away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the
          ground and EXPLODES. Ripcord and Duke jump back. Ripcord
          glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine. Three
          words: "CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS".
          Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the
          course, awestruck. Breaker walks by eating a burrito and
          watching his bio-rhythm display.

          BREAKER
          Aw, Ripcord's heart just skipped a
          beat. Isn't that sweet?

          EXT. THE PIT - DESER - DUSK

          The sun is sinking, turning the dunes a brilliant orange.

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          Security works a console in the Security Room. Their
          infrared monitors show a HERDSMAN AND HIS CAMELS walking
          across the desert dunes. A Technician taps some keys and an
          X-RAY IMAGE shows the skeletal structures of the herdsman and
          his camels.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          EXT. THE PIT - DESERT - NIGHT

          The HERDSMAN walks across the desert with his CAMELS under a
          FULL MOON and a field of glittering stars. All of a sudden,
          MULTIPLE MOUNDS OF SAND whip past his feet, almost knocking
          him over. He stares at them as they abruptly disappear
          deeper under the sand, like diving submarines.

          INT. MOLE POD - UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

          Ana drives the lead MOLE POD, an oblong-shaped digging device
          that is just large enough for her to fit inside. She watches
          her HUD relay information about her angle of decent and her
          distance to the target. Thirty yards...twenty yards...ten...

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

          A light flashes on the console in the security room.

          SECURITY TECHNICIAN #1
          Sensors detecting seismic activity
          to the southwest. Probably just a
          tremor, but have a team check it.

          INT. TRAINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Ripcord and the other Joes watch as Duke and Snake-Eyes
          circle one another with special ELECTRIFIED PUGIL STICKS.
          Duke thrusts with a standard bayonet style move, Snake-Eyes
          side steps it, spins his pugil stick above his head and
          brings it down on Duke's head with a sword-like stroke. A
          CRACKLING SHOCK is delivered and Duke goes down. The Joes
          grimace, feeling Duke's pain. Snake-Eyes turns away, done
          with him. Duke pops back up again.

          DUKE
          Again.
          They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified
          pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins and attempts
          a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move. Snake-Eyes
          blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down
          hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again,
          the Joes react. Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off
          and pops to his feet once more.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Again.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now. This
          time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the
          sweep. Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and
          STRIKES. Snake-Eyes barely blocks it. They trade half a
          dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before
          Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow. Duke stuffs it with his
          stick and tackles Snake-Eyes. They fall to the ground, both
          receiving JOLTS. They go eye-to-eye. It wasn't pretty, but
          Duke is getting effective. Snake-Eyes pops to his feet.
          This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up. Across the room,
          Hawk watches with approval.

          INT. THE PIT'S GENERATOR STATION - NIGHT

          The huge drill bit of Ana's mole machine bursts out of the
          reinforced clay wall, it opens and retracts, Ana rolls out
          and drops to the ground. Another huge drill bursts out, it
          retracts and opens and Storm Shadow drops to the ground.
          They look around. They're between the clay wall and the
          ELECTRIFIED POWER GRID FENCE of the Pit's generator station.

          ANA
          The foundation of this fence is a
          hundred feet deep. No going under.
          Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall.
          And then there's a crashing sound as one of the wall girders
          bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it.
          Ana can hear the engine grind to a halt.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          If we don't get him out he'll
          suffocate.
          Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like I care?

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Just thought I'd mention it.

          STORM SHADOW
          All that matters is the mission.
          Ana pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six
          STEEL BLUE BEAMS in a 360 DEGREE ARC, creating a DETAILED
          SCHEMATIC of the Pit, showing rooms and people moving about
          them. She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence.
          Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers. The Man
          immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity JOLTS
          him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts
          climbing the fence. The skin on his hands and arms starts to
          burn and bubble.

          

          

          

          

          48.

          STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)
          Acceptable collateral damage.

          ANA
          (trying to out-tough him)
          Is there any other?
          Near the top the Man finally falls backward and drops down
          dead. Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper. Without
          hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence. He is
          immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling.
          This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and
          crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the OFF
          SWITCH, cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself.
          Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence.

          INT. PIT BARRACKS - NIGHT

          An area where the Joe team chills. Duke and Ripcord enter,
          sore and worked over. They move to some couches. Heavy Duty
          grooves to the blasting Reggaeton classic "Salio El Sol".

          HEAVY DUTY
          You can learn a whole hell of a lot
          about a girl by the way she dances.
          Tell me I'm wrong Snake-Eyes.
          Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up.

          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)
          See? He agrees.

          SCARLETT
          No, he doesn't. Do you?
          This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          See, he knows you have to listen to
          get to know someone. Right, Rip?
          Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over.

          RIPCORD
          What? You say something?
          Breaker sits at a chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him.

          BREAKER
          Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with
          Heavy D on this one.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          49.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          Like my man says, get a girl on the
          floor, you don't just see how she
          moves, you get the smell of her.
          What biologists tell us is that the
          decision is made by he nose long
          before the rest of the body gets
          involved. It's a question of
          pheromones.

          SCARLETT
          You're going to teach me science?
          I read all about the positron
          emission tomography studies
          concerning sex pheromones when I
          was twelve. I'm just saying, it's
          not very romantic.
          Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.

          RIPCORD
          Heavy told me she graduated college
          at twelve.
          No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          She's like a freaky genius. A
          deadly, freaky genius.

          DUKE
          You like her, I get it already.

          BREAKER
          (making a chess move)
          You can't learn this stuff in a
          book, Scarlett. You have to at
          least kiss a guy, before you're an
          expert on romance.
          The guys all laugh. Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow.

          SCARLETT
          Who am I shooting first?
          The laughter stops. Rip looks surprised.

          RIPCORD
          You haven't kissed anyone?
          Now Scarlett looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he
          could take his words back. Duke just shakes his head.

          

          

          

          

          50.

          DUKE
          Really firing on all cylinders
          there, Rip.

          HEAVY DUTY
          All I know is, when the bass get's
          that booty shaking in the right
          way, I'm in the skin like a man
          named Flynn.
          Heavy Duty does a little freak dance. Scarlett makes a show
          of disgust. Ripcord watches Scarlett, then makes a decision.

          RIPCORD
          Hell with it.
          He strides across the room toward Scarlett. Breaker notices.

          BREAKER
          (to no one in particular)
          Into the Valley of Death rode the

          600.
          Heavy Duty looks at him, confused. Breaker nods to Ripcord,
          stopping near Scarlett's chair. Ripcord sees Snake-Eyes
          taking in his every move. Scarlett now has her nose in a
          book. Ripcord CLEARS HIS THROAT but she doesn't look up. He
          peers closer and WE SEE THE COVER, on which, though in
          English, is a damn near INDECIPHERABLE SCIENTIFIC TITLE.

          RIPCORD
          Beach reading, huh?
          She groans and lowers the book only slightly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the
          wrong foot...
          Without changing expression she goes back to her book.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Okay look, I'm attracted to you.
          And you, you're attracted to me.
          And him--
          (nods towards Snake-Eyes)
          The Zen Master, he creeps me out,
          but what I'm saying is--

          SCARLETT
          "We're attracted to one another."

          

          

          

          

          51.

          RIPCORD
          Thank you.

          SCARLETT
          That's what you're saying, not what
          I'm saying.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, what are you saying?

          SCARLETT
          Attraction is an emotion. Emotions
          are not based in science. And if
          you can't quantify or prove that
          something exists, well, in my
          mind... it doesn't.

          RIPCORD
          Okay, I'll get back to you on that.
          And he walks away scratching his head. Hawk steps in.
          Everyone comes to attention.

          HAWK
          Duke, You scored in the top half-
          percent of all people we've ever
          tested. Rip, well, if we average
          your scores with Duke's, you pass
          too. Welcome aboard,
          provisionally. But we still need
          to see if you pass muster in the
          field.
          Hawk gives them a nod. Duke and rip nod back with pride.

          HEAVY DUTY
          YO JOE! Welcome aboard, boyz!

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Ana, Storm Shadow and the Neo-Vipers creep down the hallway.
          Two GI JOE GUARDS come around a corner, before they can even
          react, Storm Shadow practically cuts them in two with his
          Katana sword. Ana Directs them down another hallway.

          INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

          A DOOR reads, "General Hawk". Cover Girl walks up and
          knocks. As she waits, we see a SHADOW moving behind her.
          Hawk opens the door. She hands him her POWERBOOK and a

          STYLUS.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          COVER GIRL
          Sorry to disturb you, general.

          HAWK
          That's all right, Cover Girl. What
          am I signing now?
          Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her
          chest. She drops lifelessly, revealing Storm Shadow behind
          her. Hawk grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two
          swords. One slices the barrel of the pistol clean off, the
          other buries itself in Hawk's gut. Hawk collapses. Ana
          steps forward and rips the General's SECURITY BADGE off his
          jacket. Hawk's eyes follow them as they leave. He glances
          at a RED BUTTON under his desk and struggles to reach it,
          giving everything he's got, until he finally hits the button.

          INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

          A KLAXON BLARES. Duke, Ripcord and all the Joes leap up.

          DUKE
          The warheads.
          They all rush out of the doors. Breaker stops to change a
          chess piece on the board before racing out.

          INT. MAIN VAULT - NIGHT

          Ana swipes Hawk's SECURITY BADGE across the lock of the VAULT
          DOOR. It opens.
          The weapons case sits on a table. She opens the case to
          check that the four warheads are inside, they shine on her
          glasses.

          INT. MAIN VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

          Duke and Ripcord reach the main vault, armed only with their
          pistols. They find the INNER VAULT DOOR ajar. They
          approach, pushing back the door to discover that the place is
          empty and the weapons case is gone.

          DUKE
          They can't be far.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          INT. URBAN AREA - NIGHT

          Some of the Neo-Vipers now reach the MOLE PODS and begin
          prepping them for escape. BOOM! A GRENADE slams into them,
          killing them and destroying the pods. It's Heavy Duty with
          his "MPL". Ana enters the room and quick-draws her PULSE
          PISTOL and blasts away. Heavy Duty dives behind cover, which
          is blown away, knocking him out cold.
          Storm Shadow examines the ruined MOLE PODS, glancing around,
          his eyes falling on a pair of "ARCLIGHT" JET PACKS mounted on
          a wall rack nearby. Storm Shadow strides to the nearest one
          and puts it on. Ana heads after him, still carrying the
          case. Suddenly, Duke and Ripcord rush up behind them, guns
          raised.

          DUKE
          Put the case down, Ana,
          Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow.

          RIPCORD
          And you get out of that...thing.
          Stalemate. Storm Shadow doesn't move. Ana turns and looks
          at Duke. Sets the case down, her voice is gentle.

          ANA
          Fine. Done.
          Then she takes a step toward Duke.

          DUKE
          Stop, Ana. Stop right there.
          But she doesn't. She just keeps slowly moving toward him.

          ANA
          You can't shoot me, can you?

          DUKE
          I will if I have to.

          ANA
          Deep down, you're still the same
          man I fell in love with.

          DUKE
          Don't force this, Ana.

          

          

          

          

          54.

          ANA
          What could have been, right, Duke?
          You beside your best man. Me
          walking down the aisle.

          RIPCORD
          Don't listen to her, Duke.
          (a thought)
          Was I really going to be your best
          man?

          DUKE
          (cocking the pistol)
          Don't make me do this god-damnit!

          ANA
          "Don't make me do this?" A
          recurring theme in your life, right
          Duke?
          She takes another step. Duke levels his pistol right at her
          forehead. Storm Shadow flinches. Duke gives him a glance.

          DUKE
          Move and I'll blow her away.
          (to Ripcord)
          Get the briefcase.
          Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the
          trigger. Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves
          slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase. Ana is now an inch
          from the extended barrel. Ana and Duke are close enough to
          feel each other's breath. Their eyes lock.

          ANA
          Do it, Duke. .You already killed
          me once.
          And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit. Ripcord
          passes Ana, and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at
          Duke's pistol. AN ERRANT SHOT GOES OFF. Storm Shadow lunges
          at ripcord, SLICING his pistol in half with one sword and
          about to kill him with the other.
          When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME. CLANG! Snake-
          Eyes' KATANA BLADE saves Ripcord's life by a half inch.
          The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and immediately open fire,
          pinning both Duke and Ripcord down. All hell breaks loose.
          Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords
          flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords. Face-
          to-face, staring hard into each other's eyes.

          

          

          

          

          55.
          Snake-Eyes glances at Storm Shadow's right forearm, spotting
          the same RED MARKINGS of his ninja clan underneath his suit
          sleeve. This shocks the hell out of Snake-Eyes. Storm
          Shadow smiles.

          STORM SHADOW

          (CYNICAL)
          Hello brother.
          Snake-Eyes looks shocked. Storm Shadow uses the moment to
          elbow him in the face, knocking him hard to the ground. Ana
          grabs the weapons case as Scarlett rushes in, aiming her

          CROSSBOW PISTOL.

          SCARLETT
          I believe you've got my luggage.
          Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her
          shot tears the CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett's hands.
          Ana's got her dead-to-rights until Scarlett triggers her CAMO-
          SUIT, melting into nothing right in front of Ana.
          Ana doesn't spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she's
          stuck hard. The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her
          pistol is knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but
          that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped.
          Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but
          Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her.
          Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow
          climbs back into the Arclight. Looking at ana as she falls
          near a vehicle on the blocks. Ana grabs an OIL PAN and
          flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including
          Scarlett, making her visible. Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks
          her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of
          her.
          Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air,
          powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine
          pack. He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana
          by her arm, pulling her along. Ana grabs the weapons case
          and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing
          pad. The battle raging below them.
          Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the
          next level. Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the
          last of the Neo-Vipers. Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett who's
          nursing her neck.

          INT. ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          Ana climbs to Storm Shadow as the rocket up to the SECURITY
          ROOM WINDOW and BLAST it out of their way. SHATTER CITY.

          

          

          

          

          56.

          INT. SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT

          They fly into the security room and quickly dispatch the few
          technicians still alive. Ana his the large switch on the
          console and the huge door begins to spiral open. She jumps
          back into Storm Shadow's arms and they blast back out--

          EXT. ENTRANCE - THE PIT - NIGHT

          --and fly up through the hole where their Typhoon gunship
          rockets up. They fly in through a door as four Joe ANTI-
          AIRCRAFT TURRETS spring out of the sand, firing away at the
          Typhoon as it speeds away into the dark desert night...

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN

          Dawn light shimmers across the reflecting pool, the Lincoln
          Memorial, the Washington Monument.

          SUPER: WASHINGTON D.C.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAWN

          The AMERICAN PRESIDENT quickly but quietly closes the door to
          his bedroom, throwing on a robe, he charges down a corridor,
          trailed by his STAFF and BODYGUARDS. One of the staffers
          hands the President a report which he skims through.

          PRESIDENT
          How many warheads?

          STAFFER #1
          Four, Mr. President.

          PRESIDENT
          Any threats? Any demands?

          STAFFER #1
          None so far, sir.

          STAFFER #2
          We take this to mean the terrorists
          are unfocused, no clear goals.
          The President stops, glancing gravely back at his staff.

          As I have never forgotten what the
          French did to Clan McCullen.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          In the shadowy operating chamber, the Doctor approaches
          Zartan who sits on a gurney, scanning his PDA. Dozens of
          SMART ROBOTS warm up as the Doctor flicks on switches.

          THE DOCTOR
          Are you ready, Mr. Zartan?

          ZARTAN
          This is going to be the achievement
          of a lifetime.

          THE DOCTOR
          For you and me both.

          ZARTAN
          Eighteen months of studying the
          subject, learning the mannerisms,
          adopting his eating habits, losing
          sixty percent of my muscle mas...

          THE DOCTOR
          Your commitment has been inspiring.
          McCullen enters.

          MCCULLEN
          Gentlemen. About to get under way?
          Zartan raises his PDA.

          ZARTAN
          Once the ledgers are all square.

          MCCULLEN
          Check your account.
          Zartan checks the PDA. McCullen shakes his head.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          It's always about the money.

          ZARTAN
          It's a useful tool. You should
          understand that. Ah! The transfer
          just hit my account.
          Zartan puts the PDA aside, leans back on the gurney and

          CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES.

          

          

          

          

          59.

          ZARTAN (CONT'D)
          Let's do this.
          The Doctor straps Zartan down, then starts the SMART ROBOTS
          which converge on Zartan, injecting his body with dozens of
          long needles. He remains conscious, not feeling any pain.
          WE ZOOM into a LARGE NEEDLE which OPENS an INCISION behind
          his right ear. The needle feeds thousands of tiny NANO-MITES
          into Zartan's head. Zartan's eyes bulge, he starts to SCREAM
          and fight his restraints as the nano-mites begin to reshape
          his appearance, reforming facial bones and changing the
          texture and elasticity of his skin and even changing the
          color of his eyes. The Doctor grins proudly. McCullen looks
          disturbed.

          INT. URBAN AREA - THE PIT - DAY

          Joes are busy cleaning up the mess. Snake-Eyes sits by
          himself, hasn't moved in several hours. A thousand yard
          stare in his eyes. AND WE FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. A DRIZZLING SAIGON ALLEY - NIGHT

          A TEN YEAR OLD FRENCH ORPHAN BOY, cold from the rain and
          desperately hungry, scavenges for food in a garbage can, he
          looks up and notices a warm light coming from the other side
          of a wall and gate MARKED WITH RED CLAN MARKINGS.
          INSIDE THE TEMPLE: Young Snake Eyes sneaks in through the
          Kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter. As he
          takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED
          CLAN MARKINGS on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow,
          healthy, wealthy, and well fed.

          YOUNG STORM SHADOW
          Thief !
          He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake-
          Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot. They fight
          fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and
          furniture. Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm
          Shadow's classic training gives him the edge. He finally
          traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his
          face. He starts to choke Snake-Eyes with his foot ...

          HARD MASTER (O.S.)
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Enough! Storm Shadow!
          A Ninja Master steps forward. Storm Shadow turns to him.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          YOUNG STORM SHADOW
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Father, he was stealing. We need to
          call the magistrate.

          HARD MASTER
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          He is hungry. We need to invite him
          in and show him the way.

          STORM SHADOW
          He's a cur! A Frenchie!

          HARD MASTER
          He doesn't fight like one.
          The two young warriors glare at one another.

          HARD MASTER (CONT'D)
          (Japanese, subtitled)
          Now what shall be your clan name?
          Snake-Eyes glares up at Storm Shadow, narrowing his eyes
          furiously. Hard Master just smiles, AHl
          AND WE FLASH BACK TO: Snake-Eyes in the motor pool, he stands
          up and walk off...

          INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

          Battered and bruised, Scarlett hurriedly enters the barracks.
          Checks around to see that she's alone. Then she heads for a
          mirror over one of the sinks, peeling back her collar to
          check the CHOKE MARKS on her neck. Her hands are trembling.
          She turns on the water and cleans her face with a WASH CLOTH.
          Ripcord enters the barracks behind. Like Scarlett, he looks
          around to see if he's alone. He catches Scarlett looking at
          him in the mirror, as if he's unwanted. Then he notices the
          choke marks. He is genuinely concerned.

          RIPCORD
          Jesus, you okay?

          SCARLETT
          I'm fine.

          RIPCORD
          You're not fine, let me look at
          that.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          SCARLETT
          I looked at it, it's fine.

          RIPCORD
          Take it easy, just trying to help.

          SCARLETT
          I know what you're trying to do.

          RIPCORD
          And what is that exactly?

          SCARLETT
          I don't have time for this.

          RIPCORD
          You know, not every guy you meet is
          an asshole. You do know that, don't
          you?
          Scarlett stops and returns to the sink, he ignores her,
          cleaning the blood off his face. She softens.

          SCARLETT
          It's not you, I... I didn't really
          want anyone to... see me in here.

          RIPCORD
          Why not?

          SCARLETT
          I don't know. All the people we
          lost last night. General Hawk... My
          neck is not that important.

          RIPCORD
          You almost died. You're allowed to
          be concerned.

          SCARLETT
          First fight I've lost since I was a
          kid. My father would be... he was
          my instructor.

          RIPCORD
          Think he's be disappointed.

          SCARLETT
          He taught me to win.

          RIPCORD
          I don't know how you teach anybody
          to win at everything every time.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          62.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          But I do know you can teach someone
          to get up when they get knocked
          down.
          Ripcord turn her gently in the mirror.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Look at you. Still here. Maybe this
          is what he wanted you to learn.
          Scarlett stares at her reflection briefly.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          But of course, that would be an
          emotional response, one that can't
          be explained or quantified.
          Ripcord turns and heads for the door. Scarlett watches him.

          SCARLETT
          We're not a couple. Snake-Eyes and
          me. We're... close, he's like a
          brother, but... we're not a couple.
          Ripcord looks back at her, nods, then walks on out.

          INT. MEDICAL RECOVERY WING - DAY

          Hawk is hooked up to a LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE. Duke sits
          nearby, his shoulder being bandaged by a Medical Officer. WE
          PUSH IN ON Duke's eyes, staring into oblivion, AND FLASHBACK

          CUT TO: HAWK'S FACE RIGHT AT CAMERA:

          HAWK
          Can you kill her?
          And then WE FLASHBACK TO: Ana strangling Scarlett, a smile on
          her face. Squeezing harder, harder. Pure evil.

          DOCTOR (V.0.)

          (PRELAP)
          That ought to hold you.

          INT. MEDICAL WING - DAY

          Duke "comes to" as the Doctor finishes and walks away. Duke
          takes a breath, looks to Hawk in his bed, then stands and
          walks over. He stares down at Hawk, then, a promise--

          DUKE
          Graveyard dead.

          

          

          

          

          63.

          INT. MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Duke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Heavy Duty stare at
          some next-gen computerized ultra-sound PHOTOSTATS of a dead
          Neo-Viper. Snake-Eyes points in question to an area.

          SCARLETT
          Nano-mites. I wrote my thesis on
          the theory behind them at Oxford.
          They've been surgically implanted
          behind the ear, all programmed to
          accomplish different tasks.

          DUKE
          Like what?

          SCARLETT
          Theoretically, the possibilities
          are endless. Increase their speed,
          agility, resilience. You program,
          they perform. That's the genius of
          nanotechnology, it can do pretty
          much whatever you want it to.

          DUKE
          Mind control?

          SCARLETT
          I don't see why not.

          INT. CORRIDOR - THE PIT - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord move with the others through a corridor.

          DUKE
          Their weaponry, financing, intel,
          it has to be McCullen. Doing an
          inside job on his own warheads.

          SCARLETT
          You may be right. Maybe he needed
          NATO to pay for his R D.

          RIPCORD
          The weapons case!
          Everyone stops and looks at Ripcord like he's nuts.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          Remember he had us open the case
          for him. Remember that?

          

          

          

          

          64.

          SCARLETT
          What about it?

          RIPCORD
          I'll bet that code he gave us like
          re-activated the tracking beacon or
          something.
          Looks pass among the group, it starts to make sense.

          DUKE
          And who says you're not a thinker.
          All of the sudden, Breaker rushes up to them, out of breath.

          BREAKER
          I think I found her...

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - DAY

          Breaker leads the group into the control room where a WEDDING
          PHOTO OF ANA AND DeCobray is up on screen. Duke stares at the
          photo, gazing at her face. Ripcord sees her and knows, too.

          DUKE
          Yeah, you found her all right.

          BREAKER
          Her name is Ana DeCobray now,
          Baroness if you're feeling formal.

          RIPCORD
          Wow, she traded up, huh?
          (off Duke's look)
          I mean... financially.

          DUKE
          Who is he?

          BREAKER
          Baron DeCobray. Big shot French
          scientist. Runs a lab in Paris.

          SCARLETT
          Lab?
          Breaker call up an image of DeCobray standing in front of a
          huge PARTICLE ACCELERATOR along with some other scientists.

          BREAKER
          Particle accelerator.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          SCARLETT
          They're gonna use him to weaponize
          the warheads.

          DUKE
          That's where she's going.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Who likes croissants?

          EXT. BLACK SKY - NIGHT

          And then a lighted aircraft in the distance approaches at
          Mach three. It's the Howler.

          INT. THE HOWLER - NIGHT

          The Joes are silent, eyes ahead. Scarlett shares a smile with
          Ripcord, next to her, Across from them Duke watches, almost
          smiles, then lays back his head and closes his eyes. AND WE

          FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - DAY

          CAMERA PANS AROUND a village choked by thick jungle as
          EXPLOSIONS erupt in SLO-MO and a BLACKHAWK circles, ROTORS
          beating hypnotically, giving the images a dreamlike quality.

          INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER, DAWN - FLASHBACK

          Duke, Ripcord, Rex, and the rest of an insertion team, sit
          with their backs against the chopper walls.

          DUKE
          Per the briefing, we fast rope in,
          form up and assault the main lab...
          (a glance at Rex)
          Rex--uh, .the science officer,
          stays back with Fireteam Alpha
          until Bravo enters and secures the
          building. Alpha holds the perimeter
          while science officer secures the
          WMDs. Five minutes before
          extraction and the airstrike.
          The squad nods.
          Duke looks to Rex again. Rex is sweating, trying not to show
          it. Duke hands him a piece of gum.

          

          

          

          

          66.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Double Bubble?
          Rex takes it. Duke blows a bubble, smiles at Rex.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Always helps me. You good?

          REX
          (weak smile back)
          Yeah...
          They chew their gum.

          EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - FLASHBACK - DAY

          DOWN IN THE VILLAGE: Duke leads a frontal assault of the main
          building. They take fire from some GUARDS, but put them down.
          Other GUARDS flee. The way to the door is cleared. Duke gives
          hand signals along with his commands.

          DUKE
          Go, Bravo.
          Bravo, a TWO-MAN fire team hit the door of the building. They
          disappear inside.
          Rex, a kit bag over his shoulder and a .45 Colt ACP on his
          hip, waits in a crouch, Duke next to him puts a hand on his
          shoulder. Duke scans the treeline for any treats.
          One of Bravo Team appears in the doorway and signals "ALL
          CLEAR." Duke double taps Rex on the shoulder.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          You're good to go, Rex. You don't
          find it in four minutes, get out of
          there, because that house won't be
          standing in five. I already called
          for the air strike.
          Rex nods. Duke gives him a smile. Rex takes off and runs low
          to the door, entering the house. Duke watches him go, then
          looks back to the jungle and hears the WHUMP of mortars. Duke
          takes one more look, Rex disappears safely inside, then the
          mortar rounds start to hit.
          The ground is torn apart, dirt flying in the air, as Duke,
          Rip and the rest of the squad takes cover.
          We catch glimpses of the enemy, lots of them, in the jungle,
          firing. Duke and Ripcord pop up and return fire.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          RIPCORD
          I've gotta level with ya!

          DUKE
          I hate it when you level with me.

          RIPCORD
          Gonna be a long five minutes.
          Duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing. Then, in the
          distance, RUMBLING coming from the sonic roar of JETS.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          I love that sound...
          But then he looks to Duke, confusion on his face.

          DUKE
          No, no, no... It's too soon.
          ANGLE ON: The F-16s in formation streaking toward them across
          the sky. Duke looks back at the main building.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          Rex.
          Duke runs for the building. Tracer fire and mortar explosions
          all around him. Then the whistle of a bunker buster. Duke
          dives and BOOM! The building is flattened by the bomb. Duke
          is tossed through the air like a rag doll. Lands hard, barely
          registers the pain, staggers up, bloody and ripped, stumbles
          toward the smoking. Flaming rubble that was the building.
          The Blackhawk comes sweeping low, ready for extraction, the
          tracer fire and explosions intensify. Black smoke washes over
          Duke. Ripcord finds him in the debris.

          RIPCORD
          Blackhawk's waiting. Come on, we've
          got wounded! And incoming enemy!
          Lots of 'em!

          DUKE
          I can't.

          RIPCORD
          Nothing you can do. Come on...!
          Gunfire bursts around them as Ripcord pulls Duke away from
          the ruins of the house.

          

          

          

          

          68.

          INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER - FLASHBACK

          TIGHT ON Duke's haunted, soot-streaked face as his eyes take
          on a thousand-yard stare. AND WE CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT:

          INT. HOWLER - NIGHT

          Duke is wide awake, his eyes have on a thousand-yard stare...

          EXT. PARIS - FRANCE - DAY

          Paris by day, the Eiffel Tower in all her glory.

          EXT. GUARD SHED - LABORATORY - DAY

          Ana's SCARAB ATTACK TRUCK pulls up to a GUARD SHED outside a
          large building which is surrounded by an ELECTRIFIED FENCE. A
          SECURITY GUARD steps out of the shed and taps on the driver's
          window. The Neo-Viper behind the wheel lowers the BACKSEAT
          WINDOW, revealing Ana and Storm Shadow in the back. The guard
          smiles at Ana. They speak in French, subtitled.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Good Morning. Baroness.

          ANA
          Good morning. Gene. My husband's
          expecting me.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Absolument.
          The Security Guard opens the ELECTRONIC GATE and the Scarab
          drives up to the building.

          INT. FOYER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Two SECURITY GUARDS look up from their desks as Ana and Storm
          Shadow stride through the DOORS with two Neo-Vipers. Storm
          Shadow throws something. Both guards fall dead. THROWING
          STARS in their heads. The Neo-Vipers steal behind the desk,
          throw a switch, open a LOCKED DOOR for Ana and Storm Shadow.

          INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Ana and Storm Shadow enter a colossal chamber which is all
          but consumed by the PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          LAB TECHNICIANS swarm all over it, taking readings and making
          adjustments, under the eyes of DeCobray who sits at a control
          station surrounded by monitors. Ana gives the weapons case to
          Storm Shadow who hangs back as she walks up to her husband.

          DECOBRAY
          Ana...?

          ANA
          I need you to do something for me
          and I don't have much time.

          DECOBRAY
          (sees Storm Shadow)
          Who is this?
          She beckons Storm Shadow who sets the weapons case down on
          DeCobray's desk, opening it up to reveal the four NANOTECH
          WARHEADS and their launchers. DeCobray stares, bewildered.

          DECOBRAY (CONT'D)
          I don't understand... what are these
          things? What's going on?

          ANA
          They're warheads, dear. And I need
          you to weaponize them for me...
          (looking around)
          .or we'll kill everyone in here.
          DeCobray stares at her, shocked. He looks at Storm Shadow who
          removes a GLOCK PISTOL from his belt and shoots a TECHNICIAN.
          Chaos erupts. DeCobray shouts to the room, calming the others
          somewhat. He stares at Ana and Storm Shadow, terrified.

          DECOBRAY
          This is a civilian laboratory. We
          don't have the correct programming
          protocols for weaponizing...

          ANA
          The protocols are in the case.
          (he hesitates)
          I told you, I don't have much time.
          DeCobray reluctantly takes the weapons case.

          EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          A BRAWLER charges through the streets. On the outside it
          looks like your Uncle's R.V, but inside it's all next-gen.

          

          

          

          

          70.

          INT. BRAWLER - LABORATORY - DAY

          Heavy Duty drives the Brawler while Breaker mans a hi-tech
          terminal next to him. In the back, Snake-Eyes loads his guns
          while Scarlett, Duke, and Ripcord put on ACCELERATOR SUITS.

          SCARLETT
          Heavy D and Breaker will stay in
          the Brawler, watch our back. The
          rest of us will break into the lab
          with the accelerator suits. Once
          the warheads are weaponized,
          they'll be extremely volatile. We
          can't afford to let any of them go
          off inside the city.
          Ripcord looks at Snake-Eyes.

          RIPCORD
          What about you? Don't you get a
          suit?
          Snake-Eyes just looks at him, "Are you kidding me?"

          SCARLETT
          He doesn't need one.

          INT. PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CHAMBER - LABORATORY - DAY

          A TREMENDOUS WHINE echoes through the chamber as the particle
          accelerator come to life, HUMMING evenly. Storm Shadow backs
          up a little. Ana glances at him. He shrugs, what? Technicians
          quickly finish up and back away from the accelerator.

          DECOBRAY
          Firing.
          DeCobray hits a switch. The PARTICLE ACCELERATOR charges and
          begins hurling atoms through miles and miles of underground
          tunnels. Inside the accelerator, the four warheads begin to
          spin in a GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER -- then, as the power grows,
          they begin to rise, each one hovering as they spin.
          Ana and Storm Shadow watch with mild curiosity as the noise
          inside the chamber builds. The atoms catapulting faster and
          faster through the tunnels, bombarding the warheads again and
          again. Until finally, a LOUD BOOM rings out. And the warheads
          slowly sink back down and stop spinning.
          DeCobray keys another button and the GLASS VACUUM CHAMBER
          emerges from the accelerator.

          

          

          

          

          71.
          Technicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the
          warheads, returning them to their case. Storm Shadow locks
          the case and picks it up.

          DECOBRAY (CONT'D)
          Careful... they're alive.

          ANA
          Thank you, Leon.

          DECOBRAY
          I think I have never seen the face
          of evil until I looked at you now.
          Ana looks at him and falters, something in his words piercing
          her hard veneer. She feels Storm Shadow watching her and
          with a flick of her eyes, the walls go up again. She drop a
          SEALED ENVELOPE on DeCobray's desk and heads for the door.

          ANA
          Adieu.
          DeCobray watches her go, then opens the envelope. We see the
          LARGE HEADER printed on the first page: "ACCORD DE DIVORCE".

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - LABORATORY - DAY

          The Brawler races up towards the lab, they see it out their
          forward windows.

          HEAVY DUTY
          There it is.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - DAY

          Ana and Storm Shadow emerge from the lab and climb into the
          back of the Scarab as the two Neo-Vipers climb in the front.

          INT. FOYER - DAY

          DeCobray stumbles out to the foyer, finds the two Security
          Guards dead, and quickly picks up a phone.

          EXT. GUARD SHED - DAY

          The Security Guard in the guard shed puts down his phone and
          glances at the oncoming Scarab just as a Neo-Viper leans out
          with his PULSE RIFLE and blasts the whole shed to pieces.
          The Scarab crashes right out the gate.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER/SCARAB - DAY

          At the same time, the Brawler reaches the laboratory and
          there's a split second where both sides see each other in
          their windows. Duke and Ana lock eyes. Snake-Eyes and Storm
          Shadow do the same.

          BREAKER
          That's them!
          Snake-Eyes is already moving, lunging out a SIDE DOOR onto
          the street as the Brawler still moves, running right at the
          Scarab which turns to get away. Scarlett immediately follows
          him out, landing in a roll with her accelerator suit.
          Ana leans out of her window and fires her PULSE PISTOLS at
          the Brawler, keeping Duke and Rip inside. Then she fires at
          Snake-Eyes and Scarlett. Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts
          nail Scarlett. She crashes hard. Snake-Eyes glances at her.

          SCARLETT
          Keep going!
          With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back
          of the vehicle as it tears away. The Brawler stops right
          next to Scarlett, out of breath, her accelerator suit

          FRITZING.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          (to Duke and Ripcord)
          Don't worry about me, go and help
          Snake-Eyes!
          Duke doesn't need to be told twice. He leaps out and runs
          after the Scarab. Rips starts to follow, Breaker grabs him.

          BREAKER
          Careful. They're worth millions of
          dollars... each.

          RIPCORD
          Millions of dollars, got it.
          He promptly trips and crashes to the pavement. Picks himself
          up. Gets hit by a car. Picks himself up again.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          (to Driver)
          Sorry! Excusem moil
          (to a stunned Breaker)
          Won't happen again.

          

          

          

          

          73.
          Then Rip hauls-ass after Duke.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          An ACCORDIAN BUS passes casually through an intersection.
          All of a sudden, the Scarab bursts through it, ripping it in
          two and barrelling on down the busy street. Snake-Eyes is
          still barely clinging to the back.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Breaker watches the two halves of the bus whirl around on his
          SATELLITE VIEW as Heavy Duty drives through the city streets.

          BREAKER
          Christ, they just shot right
          through a bus!

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

           Duke and Rip charge after the Scarab. Their speedometers
          reading 15mph...then 30mph...then 40mph. they leap over and
          around speeding cars and trucks.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          The Scarab smashes through any vehicle in its path, leaving a
          trail of destruction for Duke and Ripcord to leap over or
          dart around in their suits. Ana and Storm Shadow hear Snake-
          Eyes on the roof and drop their windows and lean out and
          shoot at him. But Snake-Eyes quickly clambers down the side
          of the vehicle, escaping their shots by disappearing beneath
          the undercarriage.
          And that's when Ana sees Duke and Rip following. She sits
          back down inside and keys a button on a console.
          SIDE PANELS slide open on the outside of the Scarab to reveal
          two MISSILES, one on each side. They fire.
          The MISSILES streak back towards Duke and Ripcord. No time
          to get out of the way, they dive and roll in various
          directions, extreme kinetic energy hurling them forward. The
          two missiles whip between them and detonate, one on a PARKING
          OFFICER'S CAR and the other on a BILLBOARD. The EXPLOSION
          from the car knocks them down. The Scarab tears away around
          a corner.

          

          

          

          

          74.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          They see Snake-Eyes on their monitors in the Brawler.

          BREAKER
          They're turning the corner. Go
          through that building at 6 o'clock!

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord see the building in front of them.

          RIPCORD
          There's no door!

          BREAKER'S VOICE
          Make one!
          Duke charges directly at the building. Ripcord reluctantly
          following as Duke smashes through the wall into...

          INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PARIS - DAY

          A crowded bar. Neither of them slow for a second. Duke
          bolts through. Rip grabs a MARTINI, opens his visor, downs
          the drink, then places the empty glass on the tray of a
          stunned waitress. Behind her a sign reads: "DRINK
          RESPONSIBLY". Duke and Ripcord SMASH through the opposite
          wall...

          EXT. ACCELERATOR SUITS - CITY STREETS - DAY

          .back out onto the city streets where they turn and level
          their WRIST-MOUNTED ROCKETS at...nothing. A puzzling beat.
          And then the Scarab thunders up behind them at full speed.
          Ripcord dives out of the way just in time. Duke has no such
          luck. He spins and catches the FRONT GRILL, digging his feet
          into the road in an attempt to slow the Scarab down. But the
          Scarab now angles towards a busy intersection, threatening to
          crush DUKE in the criss-crossing traffic.
          Duke throws himself onto the hood just as an SUV CRASHES into
          the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage.
          Duke tumbles up onto the roof. A PULSE CANNON pops up. Duke
          dives off the back as the weapon fires. He tumbles to the
          pavement as Ripcord speeds up to him, firing his WRIST-
          MOUNTED ROCKETS at the Scarab. Duke fires with him.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          INT./EXT. SCARAB - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Their rockets nail the Scarab and knock out the PULSE CANNON.
          BOOM! But its armor saves the vehicle.
          INSIDE: Storm Shadow and Ana are knocked around. Storm
          Shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own ACCELERATOR
          SUITS. Hands it to Ana.

          STORM SHADOW
          Mr. McCullen would be quite unhappy
          if I let you die.
          Ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in.

          ANA
          How thoughtful.

          INT. BRAWLER - DAY

          On the monitors, Scarlett and Breaker watch the Scarab via
          Snake-Eyes speeding through the streets.

          SCARLETT
          Look at the moves they're making,
          they're heading somewhere.
          Breaker widens the map, plotting a route.

          BREAKER
          This's their route from the lab.
          On the screen, they see the lab, the current position of the
          Scarab, and what lies just ahead. . .the Eiffel Tower.

          SCARLETT

          (REALIZING)
          Metal... Oh God...

          EXT. SCARAB/STREETS - DAY

          Snake-Eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage.
          Duke and Rip are catching up behind him.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Guys, you have to stop them.

          DUKE
          Yeah, we're working on it.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          I mean right now. They're going to
          detonate one of the warheads on the
          Eiffel Tower.
          Ripcord glances up and sees the Eiffel Tower looming up fast.

          RIPCORD
          Oh, man...
          Under the Scarab, Snake-Eyes pulls out his GLOCK PISTOL and
          fires into the unprotected insides of the FRONT TIRES, which
          promptly rip to shreds. The Neo-Viper loses control of the
          vehicle, SMASHES through a GUARD ARM onto train tracks.
          Snake-Eyes sees something, lets go, rolls free and crashes
          into garbage cans just as a METRO TRAIN barrels into the
          Scarab, which LAUNCHES into the air, hood-over-tailpipe.
          Duke and Ripcord are running too fast to stop. Duke manages
          to leap into the air, his boots barely scraping the top of
          the train while Ripcord covers his face with his hands and
          PLUNGES headlong into a window on the side of the train...

          INT. METRO-RAIL TRAIN - DAY

          .flying across the aisle, whipping past a group of stunned
          morning COMMUTERS, and smashing out through the far window...

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          The Scarab, Duke and Rip all CRASH HARD to the pavement and
          tumble. Sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere. Duke
          and Rip finally stop tumbling, a hundred yards away from the
          wreck of the Scarab.

          INT./EXT. BRAWLER - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Scarlett, Heavy Duty and Breaker see this on their monitors.

          HEAVY DUTY/BREAKER
          Holy shit...

          SCARLETT

          (CRINGING)
          You guys okay?

          EXT. RAILWAY CROSSING - CITY STREETS - DAY

          Duke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged.

          

          

          

          

          77.

          DUKE
          What happened to you?

          RIPCORD
          I went through the train. What
          happened to you?

          DUKE
          I jumped over it.

          RIPCORD
          You can do that?

          DUKE
          Yeah, you didn't know?
          INSIDE THE SCARAB: We see the Neo-Vipers are dead. Storm
          Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in
          her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons
          case and he and Ana leap out.
          Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls
          out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana
          emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          C'mon!
          Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.

          EXT. EIFFEL TOWER - DAY

          HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower
          to buy their tickets and start their tours. Storm Shadow and
          Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they
          bound onto the stairs. People scream at the sight of Ana.
          Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their
          Accelerator Suits like beings from another world. They spot
          Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them. The
          Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke
          and Ripcord. The BULLETS ping off their suits.

          RIPCORD
          (to Duke)
          How do you say "we're the good
          guys" in French?
          Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up
          under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.

          

          

          

          

          78.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs
          and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the
          opposite side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a
          gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the
          man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing
          a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs--
          --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The
          avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the
          stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without
          a safety net. He makes it to the first floor and races after
          Ana and Storm Shadow.
          ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first
          out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them
          carrying weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the
          defensive as they hurry up to the stairway. Guns go up.
          Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French.

          SCARLETT
          (French, subtitled)
          Don't shoot! We're a special anti-
          terrorist unit! There's a bomb up
          there!
          POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them.
          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the
          main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow
          hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case
          and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH.
          Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top
          of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him
          while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's
          pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at
          Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the
          warhead.
          A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils.
          ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze.
          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in
          all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and
          hits a button for the top. The elevator races upwards as
          everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The
          floor begins to disappear. Tourists stampede towards the
          stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP. The
          mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the
          railing.

          

          

          

          

          79.
          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her
          coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in
          time. Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes.
          Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the
          tourists. He leaps up onto the iron lattice.

          RIPCORD
          Where you going?

          DUKE
          Each warhead has a kill switch.

          RIPCORD
          It's too late! We gotta get off
          this thing!

          DUKE
          Those nano-mites will level the
          entire city!
          Duke climbs up the side of the tower with his Accelerator
          Suit. Rip things about following, but then looks at the
          little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes
          grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs.
          The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them,
          Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police
          evacuate the Tower.
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.

          ANA
          (into mike)
          Be ready to pick up in thirty
          seconds.
          IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of
          the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening.
          ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing
          him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck
          just above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION
          CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower. He falls, but
          manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost
          on top of him now. The climbs even faster.
          ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm Shadow
          calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers
          up beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower
          groans and wobbles. It's a long way down. Time has run out.
          Ana and Storm Shadow jump into the Typhoon.

          

          

          

          

          80.
          With the NANO-MITES at his heels, Duke clambers up and jumps
          up off the side of the Tower, sailing up through the air and
          latching onto the SIDE DOOR of the Typhoon.
          IN THE TYPHOON: The gunship rocks with his sudden weight.
          Ana and Storm Shadow almost lose their footing. Duke springs
          inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL
          SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger.
          Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the
          ground around the Eiffel Tower.
          The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side.
          Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes
          down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of
          water. The shock on the faces of everyone around
          reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his
          eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets
          an idea.

          BREAKER
          Come on!
          He hauls-ass.

          INT. TYPHOON - DAY

          Ana looks at Duke, a pursed smile on her lips.

          ANA
          You just saved Paris.
          Storm Shadow is not happy at all, he TASERS Duke, who drops
          hard to the floor of the Typhoon.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          A crowd has gathered around the crashed Scarab. Heavy Duty
          yanks one of the dead Neo-Vipers out. Breaker yanks off the
          guy's HELMET then removes a needle-like PORT PLUG from his
          SURVEILLANCE SUIT. Scarlett moves into position to help him.
          Ripcord kneels down.

          RIPCORD
          What are you doing?

          BREAKER
          Plugging into his cerebral cortex.
          With a SICKENING CRUNCH, Breaker plunges the needle into the
          top of the Neo-Viper's head. Ripcord winces at the sight.

          

          

          

          

          81.

          SCARLETT
          The brain survives for a couple of
          minutes after death. We can read
          his most recent memories.

          RIPCORD
          Can you find Duke?

          BREAKER
          If this guy remembers the way home
          we can.
          INSERT: A FLASH OF MEMORIES appearing on Breaker's HUD.
          Duke shooting him in the face, racing along the highway,
          driving the ARMORED CAR. As the images continue, we PUSH IN
          on the Neo-Viper's open eyes and CUT TO:

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen watching Breaker and Ripcord through the dead Neo-
          Viper's eyes on a screen. He turns to the Doctor urgently.

          MCCULLEN
          Destroy that unit immediately.
          The Doctor removes his PDA and taps a key to draw up the Neo-
          Viper's file. He clicks a button that reads "TERMINATE".

          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

          Instantly, the Neo-Viper's body snaps rigid and begins to
          shake. Everyone gets a shock. Backing up.

          HEAVY DUTY
          He's still alive!

          SCARLETT
          He's not alive.

          HEAVY DUTY
          You ever seen a dead guy do that?

          SCARLETT
          They activated a self-destruct.
          The Neo-Viper's body starts to decay before them. Thousands
          of NANO-MITES literally eating away at his flesh and bones.

          BREAKER
          Nano-mites!

          

          

          

          

          82.

          RIPCORD
          They're eating him!

          SCARLETT
          Hurry, Breaker!
          But the NANO-MITES are too fast. The Neo-Viper's legs are
          now gone. His chest and arms next. Breaker rapidly scans
          through the MEMORY FLASHES. But now the NANO-MITES consume
          his head.

          BREAKER

          NOW

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - MARS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen watches Breaker's frantic face suddenly disappear on
          his screen. He gives the Doctor a smile.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Breaker looks crestfallen at the empty Neo-Viper suit in his
          arms. Ripcord kneels beside him, stunned and bereft.

          RIPCORD
          You did the best you could.

          BREAKER
          Relax, I got it.

          RIPCORD
          You got it?

          (CONFUSED)
          Well, what was the "NOO!" for?

          BREAKER
          That was for McCullen.
          There is the sound of weapons being raised. The team looks
          to see they are surrounded by FRENCH POLICE and PARATROOPERS.

          FRENCH SWAT CAPTAIN
          (in French)

          The Joes trade looks, shrug and raise their hands.

          (under his breath)
          We don't have time for this.

          they had Heavy or Scarlett, what
          would you do?
          The Joes trade looks - rock and a hard place.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          We're not doing Duke a damned bit
          of good sitting here. If it was
          reversed, Duke would be kicking
          down every door between here and
          the freakin' moon 'til he found me.

          SCARLETT
          And we'll do the same for him as
          soon as we get out of here.
          She has a thought and turns to Breaker.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          Partial? You said partial latitude
          and longitude.

          BREAKER
          We only got the one coordinate-- 90
          degrees, then the image went to
          snow.

          SCARLETT
           Maybe it was the whole coordinate,
          just 90 degrees latitude.

          RIP'S DOG TAGS hit the floor and slide to his feet. The Joes
          all look up to see several POLICE OFFICIALS looking at them.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          The Joes are led down a hallway.

          RIPCORD
          They did away with the guillotine,
          right?
          They arrive at a door. The door is opened to reveal a man in
          a wheelchair, back turned. When he spins around, it's Hawk.

          BREAKER
          General!
          Hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily.

          INT. ROOM - LATER

          The Joes sit around the General, mid-discussion.

          HEAVY DUTY
          How long before we're released?

          HAWK
          The French government is allowing
          you to leave on the condition that
          none of you ever return. Other
          agencies will be handling this from
          here on.

          SCARLETT/RIPCORD
          What?!

          HAWK
          The heads of state of every member
          of GI JOE are recalling their
          operatives. We are now considered
          a rogue unit, uncontrollable. Shut
          down. We're to report to
          Washington for debriefing.
          Hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door.

          RIPCORD
          That's it? They've got Duke!

          

          

          

          

          86.
          Hawk stops his wheelchair, turns to them.

          HAWK
          I said you were to report to
          Washington. I didn't say when, or
          which route to take.

          SCARLETT
          Maybe a northern one.
          Hawk smiles and wheels out the door.

          EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DUSK

          A NIGHT RAVEN rockets through the orange skies, SMASHING
          through the sound barrier with an ear-tingling SONIC BOOM.

          INT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DUSK

          Storm Shadow sits in a meditative state. Duke is shackled,
          hands bound, out of his ACCELERATOR SUIT. Ana steps out of
          the cockpit area and approaches him, nods to Storm Shadow.

          ANA
          He thinks I should kill you.

          DUKE
          Why don't you?

          ANA
          James wants to meet you in person.

          DUKE
          James?

          ANA
          Mr McCullen.

          DUKE
          Ana listen--

          ANA
          --Talk softly, or he'll tazer you
          again.

          DUKE
          (raises his bound hands)
          Loosen these, he'll never taser
          anything again.
          She taps the bonds on his wrists.

          

          

          

          

          87.

          ANA
          I should've thought of this before.
          They almost share a smile.

          DUKE
          Let me get this straight. You're
          with McCullen. You're married to
          that Baron. And you claim you're
          still in love with me.

          ANA
          I'm a complex woman.

          DUKE
          Maybe you just don't know who you
          are anymore.

          ANA
          Who I was died long ago.

          DUKE
          No, this isn't you, I still see the
          person I loved behind your eyes.
          Her eyes soften for a moment.

          ANA
          Tell me what she was like.

          DUKE
          She was smart, and funny. She was
          loyal as hell. She loved those she
          was close with, me, her brother...
          (agonized pause)
          I did my best. With Rex. I'm
          sorry. He was my responsibility.
          I should have... It's why I left,
          Ana. Why I couldn't be with you.
          You were in so much pain... I
          thought the sight of me just give
          you more.
          She seems to be affected by this ever so slightly, then... a
          hard, cold look comes to her eyes, she shakes her head.

          ANA
          It doesn't matter now.

          DUKE
          No, it matters very much. We have
          the chance to make things right.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          ANA
          Nothing will ever be right again.
          Duke stares at her, his heart ripped apart. WE PUSH IN ON
          the two of them and FLASHBACK TO:

          EXT. CEMETERY - WASHINGTON D.C. - FLASHBACK - DAY

          Rain is drizzling on a military cemetery. Ana sits alone,
          without family, without Duke, staring straight ahead as Rex's
          casket is lowered into the ground.
          Parked on a nearby road is a lone car. Duke sits inside it,
          staring at the funeral in the distance. His face tells us
          the anguish he's living with. He pulls out and starts to
          drive away, the rain on the windshield BLURS AS WE DISSOLVE

          TO:

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - POLAR ICE CAP - NIGHT

          The Night Raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge
          CAVE. A SET OF RUNWAY LIGHTS appear under the ice, guiding
          it in for a smooth landing. The cave swallows the plane
          whole.

          INT. ICE CAVE - NIGHT

          The Night Raven rolls to a stop inside the cave. The side
          door opens. Storm Shadow exits with the weapons case. Ana
          leads Duke out, two Neo-Vipers behind them. Storm Shadow
          clicks a hand held remote and a HIDDEN ICE WALL opens to
          reveal a HI-TECH DIVING BELL awaiting them. Duke uses the
          moment to lunge forward, grab the case and haul ass towards
          the cave door. Storm Shadow spins, Shurikan throwing stars
          in his hands. The Neo-Vipers whip up their pulse rifles.

          ANA
          NO! McCullen has plans for him!
          Storm Shadow throws a star, it whistles across the cave and
          nails Duke in his shoulder, Duke goes down hard, staggers
          back up, but the Neo-Vipers are already on him, they start
          beating the living shit out of him. Ana jogs up.

          ANA (CONT'D)
          Enough!
          Storm Shadow picks up the case and looks at Duke, face down,
          bloody and beaten.

          

          

          

          

          89.

          STORM SHADOW
          And what was your plan? Run three
          thousand miles across the ice?
          He rips his star out of Duke's shoulder. Duke sucks it up.

          STORM SHADOW (CONT'D)
          Stupid soldier.
          Duke rolls over and stares up at them, breathing hard.

          INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

          Ripcord, Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, Heavy Duty and Breaker are in
          the conn tower of a next-gen submarine, going over a 3-D MAP
          of the polar ice cap.

          HEAVY DUTY
          That's a lotta ice.

          RIPCORD
          It's gonna be like trying to find
          whale spit in the ocean.
          Breaker sees a SMALL LIGHT flashing on his Ball-Eyepiece.

          BREAKER
          That's strange.

          SCARLETT
          What?

          BREAKER
          When they stole the weapons case, I
          set my suit to scan for the tracker
          beacon in case it came back on, and
          it just came back on.
          Ripcord just smiles.

          RIPCORD
          That's my boy.

          EXT. ARCTIC OCEAN - NIGHT

          The DIVING BELL comes shooting down out of a shaft in the
          bottom of the ice cap and rockets down towards the facility.

          

          

          

          

          90.

          INT. DIVING BELL - NIGHT

          As the diving bell descends, Duke stares at the facility out
          the portal. He is awed by the immense size of the place, he
          looks at Ana, proud of her office.

          ANA
          Certain work needs to be done away
          from the public eye.

          INT. ENTRY PORT - NIGHT

          The diving bell entry port opens, guarded by two Neo-Vipers.
          McCullen stands waiting. His eyes first move to the weapons
          case in Storm Shadow's hands. Storm Shadow opens it and
          shows him the three remaining warheads. McCullen runs his
          fingers over them, then nods, Storm Shadow closes the case.

          MCCULLEN
          Take them to the drones. I want
          them ready to launch in one hour.

          STORM SHADOW
          It will be done.
          And only then does McCullen greet Ana.

          MCCULLEN
          My beautiful Lady of the Lake...
          He kisses her. Ana kisses him back with slightly-feigned
          affection, her eyes open and on Duke. Duke stands there,
          impassive. McCullen finishes the kiss and turns to Duke.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          This bother you?
          Duke says nothing, so McCullen steps closer.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          Isn't it funny, with the entire
          balance of power in the world about
          to shift, a couple of guys can
          still have a stare down over who
          gets the girl.
          Duke takes the opportunity to HEAD BUTT McCullen. The Neo-
          Vipers instantly pummel Duke to the floor. McCullen wipes a
          small trickle of blood from his nose.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          The interesting thing about my Neo-
          Vipers is they still think the same
          thoughts they always did, they just
          can't act on them anymore. Instead,
          they do what I want. I imagine that
          must be very frustrating.
          He gets right down in Duke's face.

          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)
          I'm going to make you very unhappy.

          DUKE
          (grit teeth)
          I'm already happy.
          McCullen glances at Ana, watching the display with conflicted
          eyes. McCullen heads for the door, beckoning the Neo-Vipers
          to make Duke follow him.

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          Duke trails behind McCullen and Ana, flanked by Neo-Vipers.

          DUKE
          What're you gonna do with the
          warheads?

          MCCULLEN
          You take to your training well,
          that's good. Still trying to
          develop information. Still planning
          to escape and stope me. Moments
          from now, you'll see that won't
          ever happen.

          DUKE
          Then you won't mind telling me.

          MCCULLEN
          Isn't it clear? I'm a business man.
          I'm going to use them.

          DUKE
          Millions of people are gonna die if
          you launch those warheads. What is
          it you want, McCullen?

          

          

          

          

          92.

          MCCULLEN
          Merely to strike fear into the
          hearts of every man, woman, and
          child on the planet. Only then will
          they look up to the man who wields
          the most power, and obey him.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The control room is alive with TECHNICIANS squirreling about
          various stations. Monitors show three large AERIAL DRONES
          sitting in vertical launch bays. Duke sees the drones and his
          face registers the horror of what McCullen's about to do. He
          glances at Ana, she quietly looks away, a hint of remorse in
          her eyes? The Doctor rises to greet McCullen, glancing at
          Duke for several moments, as if struck by the sight of him.

          MCCULLEN
          Meet the genius behind all my
          nanotechnology.

          THE DOCTOR
          My genius lies only in taking what
          others created to the logical next
          steps. All modern gains in science
          are made through theft.

          MCCULLEN
          You'll have to excuse his modesty,
          when I found him, he was --

          THE DOCTOR
          (interrupting, re: Duke)
          --Another "recruit"?

          MCCULLEN
          Albeit a rather unwilling one. The
          Doctor's nano-mites can control all
          manner of brain functions. When you
          wake up, you'll be working for me,
          and your past will be a distant
          shimmer that floats in and out of
          your mind like a leaf on a breeze.

          THE DOCTOR
          I'll prepare him for the surgery.
          The Doctor beckons the Neo-Vipers who shove Duke after him
          towards another door. Duke and Ana exchange one last look.
          McCullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          EXT. DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - UNDERWATER - DAY

          A school of fish swims past the facility, one fish breaks
          away from the school. CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT ON IT: it's not a
          fish at all, but a mini robotic underwater spy system.

          EXT. SUBMARINE - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          A sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters.

          BREAKER (V.0.)
          Picture's coming on line now.

          INT. CONN TOWER - SUBMARINE - DAY

          In the Conn Tower of the sub, our team gathers around Breaker
          who sits at a monitor watching what the "fish" is watching.

          SCARLETT
          It's an underwater facility...

          HEAVY DUTY
          McCullen's home away from home.

          RIPCORD
          Dukes' gotta be in there somewhere.

          SCARLETT
          Wait, what's that?
          Breaker ZOOMS IN on a massive TURBO-LASER CANNON.

          BREAKER
          Oh, Jesus...That's an automated,
          phased array turbo-pulse battery.
          (off their looks)
          A really big gun.

          SCARLETT
          Could it take out our sub?

          BREAKER
          That thing could take out a dozen
          subs simultaneously.

          SCARLETT
          Then that's our first objective.

          RIPCORD
          No, no. Duke's our first objective.

          

          

          

          

          94.

          SCARLETT
          The main force can't attack as long
          as that cannon's online.

          HEAVY DUTY
          How you figure getting it offline?
          Snake-Eyes points to the DIVING BELL CABLES n the monitor.

          SCARLETT
          Elevator cables. They've got a
          surface entrance. Shipwreck?
          She turns to the submarine commander, HECTOR "SHIPWRECK"
          DELGADO, a fiery Spanish naval combat veteran.

          SHIPWRECK
          Going up, senorita?
          Scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor.

          SCARLETT
          Snake-Eyes, Breaker, Ripcord, and I
          will infiltrate the factory from
          above and destroy the cannon. Heavy
          D, as soon as we give the word, you
          lead the assault from outside.

          HEAVY DUTY
          (nods grimly)
          Go, Joes...

          EXT. ICE FIELD - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          A quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice. All
          of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of
          all earthquakes. It cracks and ruptures and then erupts as
          the CONN TOWER of the submarine crashes through, then grinds
          to a halt. A FORWARD HATCH OPENS and two ROCK SLIDES launch
          out, landing hard on the ice and speeding away. Ripcord and
          Breaker on one. Scarlett and Snake-Eyes on the other.

          INT. LAUNCH BAY- DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch monitors showing
          TECHNICIANS securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled
          SMART-DRONES. As the last one is secured a Technician says:

          TECHNICIAN
          All drones prepared and ready, Sir.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          MCCULLEN
          Good, commence the launch sequence
          immediately.
          is that a ripple of concern flickering across Ana's face?

          INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          Our team races into the ice cave on their ROCK SLIDES and
          park beside the dormant Night Raven. Weapons up. Scanning the
          place from top to bottom. Ripcord stars at the awesome plane
          towering before him.

          RIPCORD
          That McCullen's got some gadgets.
          Breaker gestures to the ice wall. Snake-Eyes uses his Katana
          sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out,
          revealing the DIVING BELL CABLES, but no diving bell.

          BREAKER
          Maybe we could slide down.
          Snake-Eyes shakes his head, doubtful

          SCARLETT
          The arctic water would kill us.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          McCullen, Ana, and Storm Shadow watch the drones sitting in
          the launch bays on the screens. Technicians are working hard.

          TECHNICIAN
          Three... two... one... ignite primary
          engines.
          The entire control room begins to shake. The screens fill
          with fire.

          INT./EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          The Joes run outside, wondering what the hell is causing the
          earthquake. A large circle of ice near them MELTS. And then
          the first drone EXPLODES UP before them and LAUNCHES into the
          morning sky, peeling away to the east. Before they can react,
          the second drone EXPLODES UP a hundred yards away, peeling
          off to the west. They hear the third one about to rocket up--

          

          

          

          

          96.
          Snake-Eyes thinks fast, sprints into the cave, jumps on a
          Rock Slide, hauls-ass outside, hits a WEAPONS SWITCH on his
          Rock Slide, prepping two HEAT-SEEKING ROCKETS on either side
          of the vehicle. The third drone LAUNCHES UP from two hundred
          yards away. Snake-Eyes locks onto its exhaust and FIRES. The
          missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky.
          It EXPLODES. Metal FLIES. Snow BURNS.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The technicians see this on their monitors.

          TECHNICIAN
          We lost one.

          MCCULLEN
          Lost one? What do you mean?

          TECHNICIAN
          Bird Three is down, Sir.
          McCullen looks at the monitors, enraged. Storm Shadow smiles.

          STORM SHADOW
          We're under attack.

          MCCULLEN
          Alert all defences. Charge up the
          pulse cannon.
          He turns to say something to Ana, but she has left the room.

          EXT. ICE CAVE - POLAR ICE CAP - DAY

          Topside, the team watches the two remaining drones race away.

          BREAKER
          What about the other two?

          RIPCORD
          We find the kill switches and short
          out the nano-mites.

          BREAKER
          (shakes his head)
          They're already way out of range.

          SCARLETT
          Then somebody has to go up there
          and shoot those things down.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          RIPCORD

          (PAUSE)
          That's me.

          INT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Ripcord climbs into the Night Raven's cockpit. Scarlett steps
          up to watch. He's already flipping switches and putting on a

          FLIGHT HELMET.

          SCARLETT
          Can you even fly this thing?

          RIPCORD
          I can fly anything. You just track
          those warheads and guide me in. We
          don't have long until they hit.

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord?
          He glances at her, a moment between them. Then she presses
          forward and kisses him on the mouth. He stares back at her.

          SCARLETT (CONT'D)
          Good luck.

          RIPCORD
          Do me a favor? Save Duke.
          She gives him a nod, then leaves. Ripcord grins to himself.

          EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - ICE CAVE - DAY

          The NIGHT RAVEN tears across the ice and launches into the
          sky. Ripcord WHOOPS with adrenaline. Scarlett, Snake-Eyes,
          and Breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the
          ice REFORMS behind them, hiding the hole.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          We now find Duke, wearing only SURGICAL TROUSERS, strapped on
          the operating gurney we saw Zartan on earlier. The SMART
          ROBOTS warming up around him as the Doctor approaches.

          THE DOCTOR
          The atomic bomb that was dropped on
          Hiroshima destroyed seventy percent
          of the city. Seventy percent... Did
          you know that, Duke?

          

          

          

          

          98.
          Duke looks at him, something familiar.

          REX
          There was a bank situated less than
          one hundred yards from Ground Zero,
          destroyed of course. Only one thing
          survived. It's four bank vaults.
          And when those vaults were opened,
          they discovered everything inside
          them had survived completely
          unscathed.

          DUKE
          Who are you?

          THE DOCTOR
          Of course, the vault I took shelter
          in wasn't that well-made.
          He unclips his BREATHING TUBES and lowers the mask to reveal
          a scarred and burned face.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          Double Bubble?
          Duke is beyond shocked.

          DUKE
          Rex...
          Rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask
          over his face.

          DUKE (CONT'D)
          You sonuvabitch... Ana buried you.

          THE DOCTOR
          A moving ceremony, I'm sure. The
          three volley salute. The flag on
          the coffin.

          DUKE
          Why? .Why didn't you come in...?

          THE DOCTOR
          Because I found out the truth...

          AND WE FLASHBACK TO: JUNGLE BUILDING - DAY
          Rex moves through the building with Fireteam Bravo.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          BRAVE SOLDIER
          Intel says the lab's in the
          basement.
          Fireteam Bravo kicks open a door. They lead the way down a
          staircase toward the basement. Rex follows, nervous as hell.
          The soldiers round a corner, suddenly, Rex hears GUNFIRE, he
          freezes, then silence, Rex pulls out his .45 And rounds the
          corner to see Fireteam Bravo down. A GUARD is trying to clear
          a jam in his machine gun. As he clears the weapon and raises
          it, Rex raises his .45 and fires first. The Guard drops.
          Rex checks Bravo, but they're not moving. He looks around the
          basement, no lab, but he sees a massive VAULT DOOR, closed.
          He heads for the vault, 45 raised, breathing hard. WHOOSH, a
           blast of refrigerated air hits him as he opens the door.
          Rex enters a small room filled with DEAD ANIMALS in huge
          FORMALDEHYDE JARS> Something inside the animals is constantly
          reshaping their appearances, reforming their facial bones and
          changing the color, texture and elasticity of their skins.
          There is a scuffling noise, Rex points his gun. A small,
          stooped old SCIENTIST in a lab coat appears.

          SCIENTIST
          Are you going to shoot me?...
          Rex doesn't respond.

          SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
          We knew you were coming. But I
          couldn't walk away from it...
          Rex stares in awe, not what he was expecting.

          REX
          Stay where you are.
          His gun up, he finds a COMPUTER TERMINAL and begins accessing
          various files, starts reading them.

          REX (CONT'D)
          These aren't chemical or nuclear--

          SCIENTIST
          No. Something much... better.

          RES
          This is beyond anything... This is
          light years ahead of anyone in the
          field.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          SCIENTIST
          You see why I couldn't leave.
          Rex nods, hypnotized by the science in front of him, an
          instant bond formed with the man who created it. The distant
          sound of Jets. The Scientist moves to the vault door and
          begins pulling it closed as we hear the J-Dam Bunker Buster
          whistling towards them.

          SCIENTIST (CONT'D)
          If we live, I'll show you
          everything...

          WE SMASH CUT BACK TO THE MEDICAL WING - PRESENT
          Duke tries to absorb what he's learned. The Doctor continues.

          THE DOCTOR
          The man who created this technology
          was not our enemy. In fact, he was
          hired by our very own government to
          create it. When it was deemed too
          unethical, they sent us to kill
          him. He didn't survive the blast.
          But I... lived.
          (touches his face)
          And I escaped with his research.
          Unfortunately I tested it on myself
          first, and lost my lungs and vocal
          chords in the process. But now I've
          perfected it, and you will get a
          first-hand experience.

          DUKE
          (his biggest concern)
          Does Ana know about this, about
          you?

          THE DOCTOR
          No... and she never will.
          He glances at the SMART ROBOTS and Duke realizes.

          DUKE
          You sick bastard... you did this to
          your own sister?

          THE DOCTOR

          (INCENSED)
          I loved my sister! Do you have any
          idea the state she was in? Me dead.
          You AWOL. Depression, drugs.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          101.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          So, I had her brought here, gave
          her a way to deal with her pain,
          gave her purpose. Made her strong.
          I gave her a new life, Duke.

          DUKE
          Why work for McCullen?

          THE DOCTOR
          He saved my life, for starters. Now
          to mention infinite resources to
          work in the field of my choosing.

          DUKE
          That's bullshit. You could have had
          any job you wanted.

          THE DOCTOR
          I didn't want any job. You can't
          play nice with science, Duke. It's
          sometimes necessary to experiment,
          to fail, even to destroy to attain
          a goal. It's a fact that McCullen
          has the guts to embrace.

          DUKE
          (still shocked)
          Everything she's done, everything
          she's become, started because she
          thought you died that day.

          THE DOCTOR
          And because you then abandoned her,
          let's not forget that part.
          And with that, he leaves Duke to the SMART ROBOTS, which
          menacingly begin to move in.

          INT. LAUNCH BAY - DAY

          Scarlett, Snake-Eyes, and Breaker drop down into the launch
          bay. They see a chrome corridor leading into the facility.

          SCARLETT
          It's pressure plated and laser
          protected. Anyway around it?

          BREAKER
          No. Any object larger than a
          quarter will fry your britches.
          Snake-Eyes shakes his head with a sigh, then steps forward
          and leaps onto the floor, landing on his fingertips.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          Then, with incredible strength, he proceeds to walk across
          the floor on his fingertips, aware of the continuous crackle
          and hum of lasers around him. Scarlett and Breaker watch with
          baited breath. Snake- Eyes now reaches the doorway.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          What you'll have to do is rewire
          the laser panel's brain by--
          --Snake-Eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips while
          his other fingers grab his sword and STAB the laser panel.
          The sound of the laser net instantly vanishes.

          BREAKER (CONT'D)
          .or you cold just stab it.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          Duke lies on the operating table as a SMART ROBOT makes an
          incision behind his right ear. Duke grimaces. A long needle
          zeroes in on the incision. As the needle dives towards Duke's
          head, a hand hits a switch and the needle quickly retracts.
          Duke looks over to see Ana by the controls, gazing at him.

          ANA
          I don't have much time.
          She rushes over and unties him and they stare at each other,
          then kiss passionately. All of a sudden, Duke feels something
          behind her right ear, he turns her head, --an INCISION SCAR.
          He looks at her, but before he can say anything, Ana's body
          snaps rigid and falls limp in his arms.

          DUKE
          Ana!
          Duke looks over to see the Doctor holding his PDA, McCullen
          and two Neo-Vipers beside him, their rifles on Duke and Ana.
          Duke gazes at Ana, desperately feeling for her pulse.

          INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Two TECHNICIANS man the firing controls of the huge TURBO
          LASER CANNON. Snake-Eyes takes them out and shuts down the
          cannon. HE sends a quick message on his WRIST-COMMUNICATOR.

          INT. CONN TOWER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees the message appear on a screen. "CANNON OFF-
          LINE. HAVE A NICE DAY." Heavy smiles and turns to Shipwreck.

          

          

          

          

          103.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Let's get in this fight.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          The GI JOE submarine peels around a rocky headland now, in
          full view of the underwater facility. A series of TORPEDOES
          fire out of the submarine's launch tubes. Most are blown up
          by the facility's Harpoon Cannon defenses, but several manage
          to hit the facility's exterior. KA-BOOM!!

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          The whole place SHUDDERS. Scarlett and Breaker blow the
          control room door and cut down the Technicians trying to
          shoot them. Breaker takes over a station console.

          BREAKER
          Okay, I've got a lock on the two
          remaining warheads. Target one is
          Moscow! Target Two is Washington!

          SCARLETT
          Give Ripcord the coordinates.

          INT. TURBO LASER CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Snake-Eyes spins to see a pair of KATANA BLADES come crashing
          down at him from behind.
          He spins, but one of the blades cuts him on his left arm,
          sending him reeling backwards, it's Storm Shadow. Who quickly
          powers the laser cannon back online. Snake-Eyes dives to stop
          him, --and as their swords meet WE FLASH CUT TO:
          THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two sixteen year-
          olds, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow, trade blows with wooden
          katanas. Storm Shadow drops Snake-Eyes, who falls hard, Storm
          Shadow steps on his throat, sword point in Snake- Eyes' face.
          Hard Master looks on without expression. FLASH CUT BACK TO:
          THE CONTROL ROOM, where Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow's blades
          flash like lightning, they battle fiercely around the room. A
          Neo-Viper charges up the controls. Snake can't stop him.

          

          

          

          

          104.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Outside, the massive TURBO-LASER swings wildly towards the
          submarine and fires. A BRILLIANT BLUE PULSE ripples through
          the arctic sea, glancing the side of the vessel. WHAM!!

          INT. CONN TOWER - DAY

          The submarine shakes hard. Rivets burst. Water pours in.

          SHIPWRECK
          The hull's been ruptured!

          HEAVY DUTY
          Everyone into the attack boats!

          EXT. SUBMARINE - DAY

          Hatches open along the sides of the submarine, deploying ten
          SHARC ATTACK CRAFT carrying dozens of Joes. At the same time,
          batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen MANTIS
          attack craft carrying dozens of Neo-Vipers emerge.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty and Shipwreck pilot one of the SHARCS. The huge
          opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Keep tight everybody.
          He fires a HARPOON TORPEDO which BLASTS a Mantis. The mantis
          craft RETURN FIRE. The whole area explodes in a pulse fire
          and harpoon blasts. The Joe submarine sinks and EXPLODES at
          the base of the facility.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          Duke cuddles dead Ana, clearly emotional. McCullen steps up.

          MCCULLEN
          Is she still alive?

          THE DOCTOR
          For now.

          MCCULLEN
          You said this couldn't happen.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          THE DOCTOR
          I didn't think it could. I've never
          seen anyone defeat the programming,
          even momentarily.
          Duke recovers and angrily grabs one of Ana's PISTOLS and
          kills the two Neo-Vipers, then turns the gun on the others.
          The Doctor lifts his PDA, finger on the "TERMINATE" BUTTON.

          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
          If I press this, Ana dies.

          DUKE
          Put it down.

          THE DOCTOR
          Your choice, Duke.

          DUKE
          Put it down!
          The Doctor doesn't move. McCullen watches the stand-off his
          right hand discreetly drawing STEEL HOSE out from his sleeve.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the Night Raven,
          the curve of the Earth visible out his windows. Ahead, he can
          see a PULSATING LIGHT.

          RIPCORD
          I see it, dead ahead.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOL - DAY

          Breaker speaks into his headset.

          BREAKER
          You have to knock it down before it
          re-enters the atmosphere so the
          nano-mites don't reach the ground.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord flicks a switch and opens a PULSE LASER on the nose.

          RIPCORD
          Uh, I've got a problem. The fire
          controls are not in here.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          BREAKER'S VOICE
          What do you mean, not in there?

          RIPCORD
          I mean I can't see them anywhere!

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Scarlett hears this and realizes.

          SCARLETT
          It's gotta be voice-activated.

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          What?

          SCARLETT
          You have to say the words into your
          flight helmet.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord lines up the missile in his sights, gets a lock.

          RIPCORD
          Fire!
          (nothing happens)
          Shoot!
          (still nothing)
          Blast away!
          Still nothing, the missile streaking onwards towards the
          Earth.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They hear Ripcord yelling over the speakers.

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          Nothing's happening!

          BREAKER
          Must be a different language.

          SCARLETT
          (to Ripcord)
          Try "teine".

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          What?

          

          

          

          

          107.

          SCARLETT
          It's Scottish for fire.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord's not sure about this, the missile arcing down.

          RIPCORD
          Teine.

          SCARLETT
          Listen to my voice, "Teine".

          RIPCORD
          Teine! Teine! Teine!
          (nothing happens)
          It's not working!

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          That's because you're not saying it
          right!

          RIPCORD
          How many different ways you want me
          to say it?

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          One way! The right way! Teine!

          RIPCORD
          Teine!
          And at last the PULSE LASER fires. Blasting the missile out
          of the sky. The CLOUD OF NANO-MITES floats aimlessly away.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They all see the missile disappear on their screen.

          BREAKER
          Nice work, Ace. You just saved
          Moscow.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord sighs with relief, already peeling away.

          RIPCORD
          Just doing my job. Guide me to the
          other drone...

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          108.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          (under his breath)
          .man, I freakin' saved Moscow!

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WASHINGTON - DAY

          The White House glistens in the midday sun.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY

          The American President's Bodyguards rush him and his staff
          down into a fortified bunker beneath the White House.

          PRESIDENT
          How soon will it strike the city?

          STAFFER
          Seventeen minutes, Sir.

          PRESIDENT
          This will be a disaster the likes
          of which we have never seen.
          As the DOORS CLOSE behind them we see the MARS INDUSTRIES
          LOGO on the doors.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Another blast from the TURBO-LASER destroys a SHARC.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees this as he takes out a MANTIS.

          SHIPWRECK
          That cannon's going to kill us all.

          HEAVY DUTY
          My guy will take care of it, trust
          me.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          Snake-Eyes kills the Neo-Viper, who falls down a large shaft
          into freezing waters. Storm Shadow lunges at Snake-Eyes and
          the two of them tumble down into the shaft, but land on a
          gangway. They both leap up and begin to fight again. The Neo-
          Viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water, seemingly
          unfazed as he slowly freezes solid.

          

          

          

          

          109.
          All of a sudden, there's LOUD NOISES and a series of ENERGY
          LASERS power on up and down the shaft between various circuit
          modules. This is where the energy is charged to operate the
          cannon. One of the lasers catches Storm Shadow's shoulder and
          burns him severely. Snake-Eyes sees this and ducks just as an
          ENERGY LASER fires on beside his head.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          Outside, the TURBO-LASER fires. The Joe craft desperately
          weave and dodge.

          INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          .and the LASER NET fades. Instantly, Storm Shadow and Snake-
          Eyes continue their desperate fight. Swords FLASH and CLANG,
          two masters at their best. AND WE FLASH CUT TO:
          THE GROUNDS OF THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where two twenty-two
          year olds, Storm Shadow and Snake-Eyes sword fight. Storm
          Shadow knocks Snake-Eyes to the ground again and places his
          steel sword against Snake-Eyes' face. Again, Hard Master
          watches without expression. AND WE FLASH CUT BACK TO:
          THE ENERGY SHAFT, where Storm Shadow slashes Snake-Eyes
          across the chest, but before he can finish him off, the
          cannon charges up again and the LASER NET slams on. Storm
          Shadow twists his body to avoid the ENERGY LASERS while Snake-
          Eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that
          threatens to disintegrate his crotch. Storm Shadow sees this,
          grins to himself.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL BUNKER - DAY

          A staffer is on the phone, looking up at the President.

          STAFFER
          It seems somebody's shot down the
          warhead heading for Moscow.

          PRESIDENT
          Thank God...
          As he says this, a SECRET SERVICE AGENT draws a SILENCED
          PISTOL and kills the other Agents and Staff. We see an
          INCISION SCAR behind his right ear and realize he is a Neo-
          Viper. The President stares, stunned and horrified. The Neo-
          Viper holds his pistol on the President as--

          

          

          

          

          110.
          --A BOOKCASE moves on the wall, revealing a secret room. An
          UNSEEN FIGURE emerges and the President stares in shock.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Up in the skies, Ripcord spots the second drone rocketing
          down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him.

          RIPCORD
          Second drone in my sights.

          INT. FLIGHT CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          Breaker and Scarlett watch in the control room.

          BREAKER
          Hurry, Rip. You've only got thirty
          seconds before it enters the lower
          atmosphere.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord's feeling the pressure. He targets the missile.

          RIPCORD
          Taine!
          But nothing happens. Scarlett's voice yells in his head.

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Teine! Teine!

          RIPCORD
          Don't yell at me!

          SCARLETT'S VOICE
          Teine.
          Ripcord takes a breath, stealing his nerves. A RED FUEL LIGHT
          starts beeping on his control board. Rip does his best to
          ignore it, focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear
          into the lower atmosphere. The light beats faster and louder.

          RIPCORD
          Teine!
          The LASER PULSE fires, blasting straight at the missile which
          is lost in the atmospheric haze below. For a moment, he can't
          tell if he hit it or not.

          

          

          

          

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The tracking in the control room provides the answer.

          BREAKER
          You missed! The warhead has entered
          the lower atmosphere!

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord realizes this as he enters the lower atmosphere
          himself. The spread of WASHINGTON D.C. Far below him now.

          INT. OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY

          In the operating chamber, the stand-off reaches its boiling
          point now. McCullen slowly approaching Duke who keeps Ana's
          pistol on the Doctor, Ana still in Duke's arms.

          MCCULLEN
          Did you think she loved you?

          DUKE
          Stay back!

          MCCULLEN
          Did you imagine your life with her?

          DUKE
          I said stay back!

          THE DOCTOR
          Don't you know you've lost, Duke?

          DUKE
          All I know is that neither of you
          deserves her.
          McCullen suddenly lifts the STEEL HOSE in his right hand--
          --A BURST OF FLAME tears out at Duke who reflexively fires
          the PULSE PISTOL at it. The intense air blast from the pulse
          pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them
          back onto McCullen. McCullen SCREAMS as his face is literally
          burned off. The Doctor freaks and drops the PDA, then yanks
          McCullen out into the corridor. Duke fires after them, then
          grabs the PDA, removing Ana's screen with a sigh of relief.

          

          

          

          

          112.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVE - SKIES - DAY

          Above Washington, Ripcord guns his aircraft after the falling
          drone. Getting real close this time. No way he can miss.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see this on the screens in the control room.

          BREAKER
          You're too close, Rip. Back up.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord gets eerily calm all of a sudden.

          RIPCORD
          Actually, I think I'm just about
          close enough...

          (PAUSE)
          .teine.
          The PULSE LASER fires point blank. The missile EXPLODES right
          in front of him. Ripcord flies through the flames, the CLOUD
          OF NANO-MITES latching onto his wings.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          The drone disappears from their screens now.

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord? What happened? Rip!

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord is now struggling mightily with his controls as the
          NANO-MITES swiftly eat his plane.
          His FUEL LIGHT flashes at him alarmingly. He angles the Night
          Raven upwards, giving it all he's got, NANO-MITES everywhere.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see his plane angle back up into the upper atmosphere.

          

          

          

          

          113.

          BREAKER
          He's taking the nano-mites back up
          into the upper atmosphere.

          INT./EXT. NIGHT RAVEN - SKIES - DAY

          The Night Raven is breaking up all around Ripcord now. He
          quickly attaches his flight helmet's BREATHING MASK.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          Ripcord turns the plane over, inverting it.

          RIPCORD
          Cur magh!
          The canopy explodes. Rip shoots back down into the atmosphere
          as the NANO-MITES devour the Night Raven, then float away...

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

          They see this on their screens.

          BREAKER
          He did it... He actually did it...

          SCARLETT
          Ripcord? Talk to me...Ripcord!
          Still nothing. And now they begin to suspect the worst. Then:

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          I asked you not to yell at me.
          Relief comes rushing back to Scarlett and Breaker.

          SCARLETT
          What happened? Are you okay?

          RIPCORD'S VOICE
          Yeah, did it work?

          SCARLETT
          Yes...yes, it worked.

          EXT. PARACHUTE - SKIES - DAY

          Ripcord smiles, parachuting down towards Washington.

          

          

          

          

          114.

          RIPCORD
          (into headset)
          Good...cause I think I'm about to
          get arrested.

          EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          Ripcord lands on the White House lawn, holding his hands up
          benignly as dozens of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS surround him.

          INT. ENERGY SHAFT - DAY

          ENERGY LASERS pulse on again, almost catching the two ninjas
          in their fight. Snake-Eyes draws his KATANA SWORD, its blade
          shimmering in the laser-light as he redirects the laser back
          into its module. Storm Shadow does the same with his sword,
          barely saving his neck. They glare at each other.
          AND WE FLASH CUT TO THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where the two 26
          year-olds fight with katanas. Storm Shadow presses forward,
          Snake-eyes side-steps and hurls Storm Shadow to the ground!
          He steps up and puts his sword tip in Storm Shadow's eye.
          Snake-Eyes first ever win over Storm Shadow.
          Hard Master CLAPS ONE TIME. Storm Shadow looks at his father,
          he can't believe it, his father seems happy for Snake-Eyes.
          He slaps the sword away, gets up and stalks off.
          FLASH BACK TO: The cannon fires and the lasers disappear,
          freeing them to continue their duel. This is it. The final
          duel. Snake-Eyes struggles, exhausted and wounded. Storm
          Shadow puts in every ounce of hate he has left. He finally
          tears Snake-Eyes' sword away and kicks him down. About to go
          for the final kill. But before we find out the climax to
          their fight, we must finish their story:
          ON THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE GROUNDS, Snake-Eyes, still 26, walks
          along the pond. He hears a LOUD CRY. Snake-Eyes breaks into a
          run, careens around a building and sees Hard Master slumped
          on the ground, a sword in his back.

          SNAKE-EYES
          Master!
          Other NINJAS come flooding in.

          NINJA #1
          That's Storm Shadow's sword!

          NINJA #2
          There! There's the murderer!

          

          

          

          

          115.
          Snake-Eyes spins to see Storm Shadow climb up the side of the
          Temple, onto the rood, give him a last look, and jump down
          over the wall. FLASH BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT where Snake-
          Eyes is suddenly filled with renewed energy, he stares up at
          Storm Shadow's katana blade poised for the final kill.

          STORM SHADOW
          You took your vow of silence to
          avenge our Master. But now you will
          die without a word.
          The LOUD NOISE gears up again, distracting Storm Shadow for
          just a beat. Snake-Eyes uses the moment to catch Storm shadow
          with his feet, holding him up for a split second as the
          ENERGY LASERS come back on. One of them burns deeply across
          Storm Shadow's neck, he SCREAMS and stumbles back and falls
          OVER THE EDGE and down into the freezing turgid waters. Snake-
          Eyes steps up and looks down to see if he surfaces... He
          doesn't.

          SNAKE-EYES
          Father always feared it would come
          to this.
          EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now. Snake-Eyes stumbles
          towards the exit, leaving his fallen Sword Brother behind.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty sees the cannon return to its dormant position.

          HEAVY DUTY
          Turbo-laser is down!
          He guns his engines, firing at a MANTIS attack craft. It
          EXPLODES. Heavy Duty howls with delight.
          Around him, the Joes begin to turn the tide of the battle. A
          SERIES OF SHOTS of Mantis vehicles getting nailed by Joe
          harpoon cannons.

          INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          They feel the EXPLOSIONS in the control room. Screens short
          out. Water starts to cascade in through BURSTING RIVETS.

          BREAKER
          Energy overload in the phased array
          battery. Power subsystems are going
          critical.

          

          

          

          

          116.

          SCARLETT
          Let's get out of here!
          Scarlett grabs Breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls
          him out of the room.

          INT. TRIDENT - DAY

          McCullen's face is horrifically burned as The Doctor helps
          him down into the Trident. EXPLOSIONS blowing above them. The
          pilots guide the sub out white the Doctor starts injecting
          McCullen with NANO-MITES. McCullen starts to SCREAM...

          INT. DIVING BELL ENTRY PORT - DAY

          Scarlett and Breaker races into the diving bell entry port
          and are shocked to find Snake-Eyes already here. Scarlett
          runs up and gently hugs him.

          SCARLETT
          Snake!
          Snake-Eyes grimaces, then looks Scarlett in the eyes.

          SNAKE-EYES
          .he's dead.
          She knows who he means, she gives him a grim smile. And
          that's when they see Duke, carrying Ana, charging up to them.
          Another EXPLOSION makes them all dash into the diving bell.
          The doors close and we hear them launch.

          INT./EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Heavy Duty notices the Trident escaping out of the EXPLODING
          docking bay into the arctic water. He angles towards the sub.

          HEAVY DUTY
          We got a runner! Cut him off!
          All of a sudden, the whole damn facility EXPLODES.
          INSIDE THE DIVING BELL: Our heroes are rocked by the BLAST,
          then they see MASSIVE CHUNKS OF POLAR ICE plummet down from
          the ice pack above, cutting off Heavy Duty and the Joes, and
          DEMOLISHING the remainder of the facility. The Trident
          disappears behind the trillions of bubbles and falling ice.

          

          

          

          

          117.

          INT/EXT. SHARC - UNDERWATER - DAY

          Shipwreck checks his targeting scanner.

          SHIPWRECK
          All other targets neutralized.

          HEAVY DUTY

          GO JOES!!

          EXT. TRIDENT - UNDERWATER - DAY

          The Trident is moving fast through the water somewhere.

          INT. TRIDENT - UNDERWATER - DAY

          McCullen turns to us and we see that the NANO-MITES have
          created a FORM-FITTING MASK all over his face. He catches his
          reflection in the portal and he grabs at the mask, the NANO-
          MITES twisting with the contours of his muscles to reveal his
          complete and ever-lasting horror. He breaks down, falling to
          the floor, then he recovers and looks up at The Doctor.

          MCCULLEN
          I guess I should thank you, Doctor.
          The Doctor is busy fiddling with his hand held PDA.

          THE DOCTOR
          I want you to call me... Commander.
          (looks at McCullen)
          And from now on, I'll be on a first
          name basis with you, Destro.
          McCullen's silver face goes blank.

          MCCULLEN
          Yes, Commander.

          INT. VIEWING ROOM - MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY

          Duke watches Ana through a two-way mirror. She sits alone in
          a holding cell. A MILITARY SCIENTIST watches her with Duke. -

          SCIENTIST
          Physically, she's fine. But without
          the correctly-coded kill frequency,
          we can't short them out.

          

          

          

          

          118.

          DUKE
          There's nothing you can do?

          SCIENTIST
          Only the man who put them in there
          has the correct code.
          Duke considers this carefully, staring at Ana.

          INT. CORRIDOR - MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - DAY

          Duke walks along a prison corridor with Ana, led by two
          PRISON GUARDS. She carries a small bundle of PRISON GEAR.

          DUKE
          I'll visit you.

          ANA
          I won't be here long.

          DUKE
          You'll be here for the rest of your
          life, Ana.
          She looks at him, her face softening.

          ANA
          Duke?

          DUKE
          I'm here.

          ANA
          After all I've done, .you can't
          save me, .it's too late.
          A BEAT passes between them.

          DUKE
          I'll visit you.
          And for a moment, she appears to crack... but then a
          sinister smile creases her mouth.

          ANA
          You know, this has only just begun.
          She touches his face, then the PRISON BARS slam shut between
          them. She holds his eyes a moment longer, then the two Prison
          Guards lead her away. Duke just watches her go, his face torn
          with pain. He walks off alone...

          

          

          

          

          119.

          INT. LANDING PLATFORM - THE PIT - DAY

          General Hawk is in his wheelchair, still recovering from his
          wounds. He leads Duke and ripcord to the Howler.

          HAWK
          With GI JOE reinstated, would you
          boys like to stay on awhile?

          DUKE
          What do you say, Rip?
          Ripcord looks at Scarlett, who throws him a wink and a smile.

          RIPCORD
          I'm good.
          They all laugh. Rip steps up to her.

          RIPCORD (CONT'D)
          So how do you feel about this?

          SCARLETT
          I feel very... emotional.
          Duke smiles and the Joes climb aboard as the platform rises.

          INT. PRESIDENTIAL OFFICES - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

          A bevy of SECRETARIES and STAFFERS greets the President. Then
          he enters the Oval office and closes the door, alone, he
          looks around, walks behind the desk, and grins as he sits, as
          if this is the first time he's ever done this. With a little
          flair, he CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and we realize this is Zartan!
          And we SMASH CUT TO BLACK and ROLL CREDITS...




                                    THE END

1   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  1

    DARKNESS - NOW

    The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the
    COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face.

    They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS
    FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding
    into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's
    dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track
    and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and
    hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel-
    eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.

    ZERO IN on TWO:
    KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes
    burning with internalized emotion...

    ... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell -
    both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported
    through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around.

    Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their
    swagger seems to mask FEAR.

    KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell.   The GIRL
    makes eye contact w/ him.

                                   SANDRA
                  Sandra.

    KABLE says nothing, just stares at her, stoic.

                            SANDRA (cont'd)
                  My name is Sandra.

                            GUARD
                  Shut the fuck up.

    Because he can, the GUARD takes a swing at KABLE'S head with
    a BILLY CLUB... CRACK!

    KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings
    again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach.

                           SANDRA
                     (to the GUARD, a snarl)
                 Putcher dick away...

                             GUARD
                 Get some.

    CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!!     SANDRA is buckled
    over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat,
    head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints,
    every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART...
    He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights
    through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle
    herself.

    The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a
    glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing
    it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the
    others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN -
    growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting
    out all thought... until...

2   INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY                                                    2

    POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL
    towards dirty white DAYLIGHT...

    NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound
    of his boots bouncing off the concrete...

    Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the
    tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke,
    sky...

    Our POV WHITES OUT as we...

    Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over
    burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers
    disappear into the grey mist.

    ... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out
    of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an
    OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella
    2005).

    In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -
    accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce
    somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin,
    then snap into place. GO TIME.

5   OTHER SPAWN POINTS                                                  5

    Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and
    INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.

6   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                             6

    What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a
    closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like
    hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits
    apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they
    hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.

7   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER                                     7

    KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES
    COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade
    away... until...

    NOTHING.   DEAD QUIET.

    SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN
    we hear a GUNSHOT.

    Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -
    after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the
    lightning, wait for the thunder.

    In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from
    behind an old car to a brick staircase.   Then another BLUE
    runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.
    BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...

    BOOM.

    ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN...
    KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly
    shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE
    into the mist:

    THOOM! THOOM!   The shells puncture air and connect
    distantly...

    The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he
    breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS
    READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic
    fire.

8   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET                                8

    A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally
    IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut
    and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM
    holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.

    From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE
    combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS.   In the top right corner
    of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat
    transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to
    your own reflection on a TV).

    We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.
    KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the
    third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND
    SPEAKERS, behind us:

    A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be
    outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly
    belong to KABLE.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
                     (clean, disconnected)
                 Eat shit please.

    THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts
    back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.
    Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store.

    A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a
    bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem
    almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his
    left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting
    the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT
    TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some
    clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the
    ground, dead.

    Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on
    him. Uh oh...

    BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the
    knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing
    straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles
    over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.
    The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and
    bone TRIPOD.

     VROOOOOOSH!!! CHUKUNK, CHUKUNK!! A SNOWPLOW BARRELS THROUGH
     THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of the way
     and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt
     flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.

9    SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET                                        9

     Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting
     obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing
     truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN
     WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting
     obliterated by another TRUCK.   It's creepy - robotic, but
     violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Can't say I didn't try...

     We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to
     the peripheral.

10   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - 2ND FLOOR BUILDING                          10

     Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking
     aim; we SNAP ZOOM in...

     SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE:

     The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on
     glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with:

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Shit! Shit!

     KABLE spins, TOO LATE -

     BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an
     open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP
     THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.

11   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET                                      11

     The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT
     collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA.

     KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They
     bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops
     to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant -

     HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O.          Blood and particles splatter
     over KABLE's gear.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                  Suckage.

     Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES.

     Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small
     GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS. He makes for it.

     The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a
     stray shot - PLINK!

                            VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  ... what the...!

     Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's
     QUICK...

     A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his
     feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE
     BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH.

     He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.

12   INT. SAVE POINT #1                                                12

     KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The
     second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on all
     around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from
     loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYCLING
     DOWN.

     The battle is over - session complete.

13   EXT. SAVE POINT #1                                                13

     KABLE steps out.    The LEDS on his weapon blink off in
     sequence...

     ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's.

     [I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row
     inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage.

     GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that
     lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they
     are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty
     thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by
     participating to commute their sentences]

     A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His
     eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from
     him.

     HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON, POINTS IT AT A GUARD'S HEAD AND PULLS
     THE TRIGGER -

     NOTHING. The GUARD doesn't even flinch. The WEAPON is DEAD,
     dormant; they all knew it.

     The GUARDS have a good LAUGH... KABLE is CLUBBED from behind -
     we...

     Back on the rattling TRAIN, where we started. The SURVIVING
     SOLDIERS - both BROWN and BLUE - are shackled to the rail -
     wounded, exhausted, hollow eyed.

                            BLUE SOLDIER 1
                  Good run, Kable.

     KABLE only looks to the floor.

                            KABLE
                      (quietly)
                  My name's Tillman.

                  Whatever your name is. You got to
                  the save point fast.

                            BROWN SOLDIER 2
                  So the fuck what? No one's getting
                  out of here alive.

                             BLUE SOLDIER 1
                  I am.   I'm going to make it.

     The cynical BROWN just shakes his head.

                            BROWN SOLDIER 2
                  Sure you will.

                  They say you only got three battles
                  left til you get out...

     KABLE says nothing.

     The CAMERA pushes in on a TATTOO on his forearm: a simple
     outline of a black box with the words inside: I AM RIGHT HERE
     WITH YOU.

15   INT. LAB - TIME INDETERMINATE                                        15

     A spartan, underground LAB.

     A PLAIN-CLOTHES TECH sits on a stool holding a simple REMOTE;
     on the table next to him is a SMALL METAL DISH. In front of
     him, floating in the air, is one of the little metallic
     FLIES.

     He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes
     right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he
     could ever touch it.

     Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the
     remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK.

     CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one
     side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air.
     There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end.

     The TECH picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the
     lens up to his eyes. Switch to:

     POV of the FLY CAM: the TECH'S face, extreme wide angle,
     examining. The image flickers, glitches - then CUTS TO:

                  about dead Orientals... they care
                  about Ken Castle -

                            CHIEF OF STAFF
                  May I hear from Gina please?

     GINA spins on him, looks CHIEF straight in the eyeballs.

                            GINA PARKER SMITH
                  OK, Bob? Bob. You realize Castle
                  has clocked exactly - one - media
                  appearance to date and that was
                  Walters' last interview before she
                  died - NINE FUCKING YEARS AGO!

                            CHIEF OF STAFF
                  Stop menstruating, just tell me we
                  fucking have it -

                            GINA PARKER SMITH
                  We fucking have it!

     The CHIEF OF STAFF bangs open a conference room door with his
     fist as they blow by - veers off and disappears. GINA rolls
     her eyes in disgust, keeps moving.

     CASTLE is opposite GINA PARKER SMITH, both identified by
     translucent animated CHYRONS. CASTLE is older now than in
     the earlier clip; early 40s - his body is more solid; hair
     cut shorter, conservative. But the eyes still SPARKLE.

                            GINA PARKER SMITH
               Slayers.

                   (big smile)
               Slayers.

     CASTLE'S accent is like pure Georgia honey.           He's a rock-

               Why isn't it murder?

     She leans in, playing the role of hard-hitting reporter to a
     T.

                         KEN CASTLE
               Gina, when was the last time you
               saw someone volunteer to be
               murdered? I'm sure you know that
               every last one of our Slayers is a
               bona fide death row inmate -
                   (points for emphasis)
               ...each one offered a chance to
               participate as an alternative to
               their sentence. Stay alive for
               thirty sessions and get set free...
               that's not a bad God damned deal.

                         GINA PARKER SMITH
               I see - and has any one of these
               men or women ever actually survived
               long enough to be set free?

     KEN just smiles, locks in on her eyes.

                  with a set of pre-programmed
                  actions, with no way to react and
                  no one controlling them - their
                  chances of survival are next to
                  nil.

                  There's a lot of men and women in

                  only need to survive one session.

                  Mr. Castle - how the hell does it
                  work?

                               KEN CASTLE
                  Simple.

     A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the
     VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - and
     then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  It begins with a single nano-cell
                  planted in the motor cortex of the
                  brain -- this cell can replicate,
                  replacing the cells `round it with
                  perfect copies...

     We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with a
     bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal cell
     next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has
     turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues,
     multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that
     the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  ... these copied cells contain
                  remote access functionality.
                  Therefore, nano plus cortex equals
                  the nanex.

     The graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands
     working a retro ATARI-style joystick... animated waves
     indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the
     Slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action.

     A half dozen GEEKS in BLACK JEANS, BLACK T-SHIRTS w/ WHITE
     SOCKS and SNEAKERS; BACKPACKS... yes, even FANNY PACKS. A
     full range of GEEK VARIATIONS: beard/mustache combos, thick
     glasses, pony tails, etc.

     One GEEK brings out the CUTEST, SOFTEST little SPANIEL PUPPY
     in the world and places it in CASTLE'S LAP.

     Meanwhile several OTHERS are directing HANDHELD SENSORS at
     GINA and thumb-clicking to establish TRACKING POINTS - her
     slightest movements are scanned and interpreted as data in
     real time.

                  She's a good little bitch.

     Somehow, in his sweet southern drawl this rolls off almost
     acceptable. The CREW has a laugh off-screen; GINA blushes.

     ON the MONITORS:

     CASTLE is showing GINA how to make the dog roll over, sit up,
     etc. GINA has her hands up, limp in front of her chin, like
     a submissive puppy begging, and she is PANTING; she's clearly
     getting into it... her every movement is MIRRORED by the
     adorable dog.

                            BOARD OP
                  That's fuckin scary.

                  Isn't it true that each human that
                  undergoes the procedure will have a
                  distinct IP address -- like a
                  notebook computer or mobile device?

                            KEN CASTLE
                  Similar, yep. But control is
                  strictly localized to the
                  parameters of our gaming
                  environments.

     Back to handheld, non-broadcast REALITY.

     KEN has GINA's hand in his hand, beaming. Her demeanor has
     changed; she's like a LITTLE GIRL with her DAD at the fair.

                            KEN CASTLE
                  Good little talk.

     Then a VOICE - deep, but speaking ARTIFICIALLY QUICKLY - like
     in radio commercials, where they use time-compression
     software to remove the silences between the words.

                            HUMANZ BROTHER
                  Ken Castle wants you to believe
                  that you are living in a safer,
                  better world. He's a liar. Mind
                  control is slavery. We will all be
                  his dog if we allow this evolution
                  to continue.

     Everyone in the STUDIO is speechless, watching the monitors -
     including CASTLE; actually, he LOVES it... he's laughing his
     ass off.

                            PRODUCER
                  Mr. Castle, we have no idea...

                  Shush!

     ON THE SCREEN, the humanz logo dissolves, 8-bit ARCADE STYLE,
     replaced by:

                  THE EVOLUTION OF MAN ACCORDING TO CASTLE

     Underneath is the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION showing the
     progression from primitive EARLY MAN to the erect MODERN
     HUMAN. In a crude ANIMATION the progression CONTINUES:
     MODERN MAN bends back over on his hands and knees; in the
     final stage he's wearing a DOG COLLAR, getting fucked in the
     ass - then fed through a MEAT GRINDER, packaged & sold as
     HAMBURGER.

     KEN looks over at the PRODUCER.

                            KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                  That's a God damn hoot.

28   EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY                                         28

     A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE
     POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood
     sprays on white.

     We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD
     wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other
     prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a
     half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in
     the same white powder - they look like tribesmen.

     One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly        *
     enjoying the show.

                         DISTINCTIVE PRISONER                            *
               Fuck him up.

     The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a
     chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant
     towers mark the perimeter.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

     Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the
     distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta
     smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind.

     The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last
     time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops
     moving.

     The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain.

     A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners.
     They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind
     to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive.

     In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses
     between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by
     an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body
     goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.

                                                          CUT TO:

29   EXT. PRISON REC AREA - DAY                                      29

     Fingers run through white powder, making patterns.

     A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hum;
     some sort of aircraft.

     KABLE looks up as the shadow tracks across him; we never see
     the craft. He looks out across the yard.

     KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut
     out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white
     cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard
     a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE
     PLAYER is SKYING for dunks.

     We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You...

     In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks
     ROBOTICALLY along on crutches. KABLE watches him,
     expressionless. It triggers a memory...

     A LITTLE GIRL, no more than two, walks along on her DADDY'S
     feet... giggling, trusting... her hands grip his big
     fingers... taking each big ROBOT STEP with him...

31   EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY                                           31

     A BASKETBALL comes out of nowhere and KNOCKS THE CRUTCH OUT
     from under the CRIPPLE, sending him ass-up on the asphalt.
     Prisoners JEER.

               Kable. Kable.

     We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with
     his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice he
     runs his hand through it, wiping it away.

     A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to
     KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look.

                         KABLE

               live another two, three. You never
               do know. All these niggaz gonna

               to go... no one ever got that close
               before, no one even done ten games
               without gettin they brains shot...
               but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just
               sittin, lookin, like he got a plan,

               business, niggaz get spooked by
               that shit. You spooky.

     KABLE turns slowly to look him in the eye, says nothing.

                           FREEK (cont'd)
               Spooky.

     KABLE looks away.

                  I killed my best friend.

32   INT. PRISON - NIGHT                                                 32

     A prisoner sings Metallica off key, but balls to the walls:

                            PRISONER
                  Master!
                  Master!
                  Master of Puppets I'm pulling your
                  strings - Twisting your mind and
                  smashing your dreams...

     KABLE is alone in his cell.

     At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT to
     push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, someone
     pushes through a wrinkled photograph.

     KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN, just a blur of golden
     hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABLE'S
     vision.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  You want to get back to them.

     KABLE is stunned, silent. He sits on the ground, shoulder
     leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in the
     picture.

                            WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  It's all you think about. It's the
                  only thing that keeps you alive.

     Her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep
     but he's too strong, too internalized. He steels himself.

                            KABLE
                  Who's talking?

     She pushes through a white NOTECARD and PEN.

                               WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Sign it.

                               KABLE
                  What?

     KABLE doesn't take it.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Sign it... please, Tillman. My son
                  David is your biggest fan. He
                  prays for you.

     This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen
     and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back
     through the slider.

     PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she
     draws out a little blood.

     KABLE yanks his hand back out.

                            WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  Need to prove it's authentic.
                  Makes it worth more.

                            KABLE
                  Why would anyone want my name?

                             WOMAN (O.S.)
                  You don't even know what's going on
                  out there, do you?
                      (beat)
                  Damn...

     At the far end of the solitary block a BUZZER sounds - then
     the SLIDE and SLAM of heavy steel.

                              WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  Gotta go.

     KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a
     lifeline is slipping away...

                             KABLE
                  Wait.
                      (he holds the wrinkled
                        photo to the window)
                  How did you get this picture?            Have
                  you seen them?

     He peers through the little window at the top of the door,
     but she's GONE...

     Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corridor
     to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces from
     the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD was
     being beaten down.



                                                                  (CONTINUED)

     A desolate white RUNNING TRACK; a guard TOWER overlooks...
     the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE.

     He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're
     right there with him, CLOSE-UP - profile, full speed... we
     hear the HARD BREATHING, the feet pounding dirt, like we're
     INSIDE HIS HEAD.

                                                              CUT TO:

34   EXT. URBAN DOWNTOWN #1 - SIMULTANEOUS                                34

     WIDE LOCK OFF - KABLE, 90 feet high, a MURAL painted on the
     side of a BUILDING. It's an AD for SLAYERS: KABLE in FULL
     COMBAT MODE, cutting loose with a FLAME THROWER.

35   EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - SIMULTANEOUS                             35

     KABLE, running - we're even CLOSER NOW... he's pushing
     himself beyond exhaustion, pure focus...

36   EXT. URBAN DOWNTOWN #2 - DAY                                         36

     Different city, same story - KABLE, a towering BILLBOARD
     PROJECTION... endless lanes of FREEWAY GRIDLOCK sprawling
     beneath...

37   EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - SIMULTANEOUS                             37

     KABLE, staggering, near collapse, lungs burning...

38   EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY                                              38

     The ICONIC IMAGE of KABLE on the famous TIMES SQUARE VIDEO
     WALL, now even more massive... the STOCK TICKERS reeling off
     disaster... he's like GODZILLA frozen amongst the
     SKYSCRAPERS...

39   EXT. PRISON RUNNING TRACK - SIMULTANEOUS                             39

     KABLE finally flames out... he breaks down to a jog, then
     doubles over, hands on his knees, gasping for breath.

     CUT OUT WIDE: KABLE is ant-size and insignificant on the
     long, barren field, under a vast grey sky... ALONE.

     MONTAGE of GAMERS' FACES, preparing to GET IT ON... All
     shapes, colors and styles, but all RICH AND POWERFUL-looking.
     Some are sweating, some calm, some beat red, others have
     guitar-playing twitch faces...

41   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - DAY                                      41

     SHOCK CUT into the HEAT OF BATTLE.

     CHAOS, CONFUSION... KABLE blasts through a cloud of exploding
     debris... A BROWN to his left is BLOWN IN HALF - the LEGS
     KEEP RUNNING...

42   EXT. SLAYER BATTLEGROUND #2 - STREET                                    42

     TED NUGENT, in BROWN camo, lines up a BLUE SNIPER in a 3rd
     story window with a CROSS-BOW. He releases the arrow and
     pins the BLUE's HEAD to the window sill.

                            TED NUGENT
                  Damn, I gonna have to eat you now,
                  son.

     An UPSIDE-DOWN CAR comes SLIDING down the street on it's hood
     and slams into TED NUGENT, VAPORIZING him...

43   EXT SLAYER BATTLEGROUND #2                                              43

     Another five BLUE SOLDIERS are taken out. Their bodies drop
     to the ground, gruesome goodness. The FIVE BALL BEARING
     CAMERAS quickly flock together and check out each body as a
     swarming unit. From a wider shot, they look like flies on
     shit... after checking out the recently deleted, they zip off
     towards the closest save point...

     they've got SLAYERS on a wall-sized screen, pay-per-view...
     they're high fiving, SMASHING up the place...                                *

46   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - DRAINAGE DITCH - CONTINUOUS       46

     KABLE LEAPS for a drainage trench, makes it, and hustles
     around the back of a burnt out building...

47   INT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - STAIRWAY                          47

     Up a stairway - the GHOST FACE on GLASS superimposed on the
     image - the face is LAUGHING, GIDDY...

                         VOICE
               Oh shit... oh shit...

48   INT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #2 - 2ND FLOOR                         48

     KABLE takes up a spot from a second level vantage point -
     from here we see a small group of BLUES moving down the
     block, scanning for survivors.

                         VOICE
               Wul hello thar...

     KABLE watches himself SWITCH TURRETS on his WEAPON.   He
     brings up a SNIPER SIGHT and locks in on a target.

                         VOICE (cont'd)
               Wait for it...

     CLOSE-UP of KABLE'S EAR: just then he hears the SUBTLEST OF
     SOUNDS creeping up behind. Whoever's controlling him doesn't
     seem to have noticed - he's too focused on the enemies in the
     sights.

     We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless,
     trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice.

                         KABLE
                   (whispering)
               Turn me around God damn it...

                         VOICE
               What'd he say?

     A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE. The SOUND is
     more distinct now, CLOSER... he's practically shaking from
     the struggle to overcome the control.

     POV: someone has reached the top of the stairs... KABLE, seen
     from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out
     window.

                          VOICE (cont'd)
               My boy gotta take a piss or
               something?

     FINALLY: SNAP ZOOM on a reflection in a shard of HANGING
     WINDOW GLASS - the outline of a BLUE, raising his gun...

                            VOICE (cont'd)
                  D'oh.

     KABLE SPINS - FAST. The TURRET is ALREADY REVOLVING when he
     squeezes the trigger...

     The ARMOR-PIERCING SHELL takes SNEAKY BLUE by surprise,
     blowing him out the back of the building...

     The BLUES in the street take notice. It's a matter of
     seconds...

     KABLE makes a run for it as the floor starts to DISINTEGRATE
     behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. SHRAPNEL drills his
     back, absorbed by the BODY ARMOR.

     BROWNS scattering... a live ARTILLERY SHELL skitters across                  *
     the pavement, belching smoke.                                                *

     BOOM.

     KABLE is running... he looks to his right - A FROZEN MOMENT:

     The SAVE POINT up ahead on the SPINNING RAILROAD.                            *

     The MOMENT passes; KABLE looks back over his shoulder - a
     rush of ROARING FLAME is COMING - FAST... at the moment of
     IMPACT we -                                                                  *

                  Who are they... who the fuck are
                  they... who's playing us?

     KABLE watches him, wondering the same damn thing.

52   INT. SIMON'S HOUSE - HALLWAY                                     52

     SIMON - 18, pale and lanky, unkempt shaggy hair; wearing a
     vintage Guns `n' Roses T-shirt from the Appetite For
     Destruction Tour - walks down a long, high ceilinged crystal
     hall with marble floors, macking on the sandwich... passes
     through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a
     massive, exotic aquarium - he's alone in what appears to be a
     vast, cold mansion.

53   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   53

     SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each one a
     3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the
     screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON
     himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TECH
     SPACE.

     The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STUNT
     JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows,
     sandwich intact.

     The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing for
     prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK
     TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, etc.
     Everything dynamic, everything moving.

     One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the
     SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS
     LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these
     categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his name
     illustrates the point.

     In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention:

                    KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS

     A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series
     of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR.

     SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTURES -
     he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by
     moving his fingers in the air.

     He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS...

     He stops on an animated graphic. A SEXY FEMALE VOICE breaks
     it all down for us:

                  Swarmers. The latest innovation
                  from Browning, this self detonating
                  cartridge offers the widest and
                  deadliest spray available from a
                  full tracking, cornering ordnance.

     A VIDEO DEMO shows the fired cartridge SPLIT into two-dozen
     smaller shells that FLASH OUT like a swarm of bees, wind
     around a corner and utterly SHRED a TEST DUMMY.

     An ANNOYING GIRL'S VOICE pops in, along with a VID CHAT
     SCREEN that takes over the MAIN WALL. She looks about 16 -
     skinny, skanky, kind of hot.

                            ANNOYING GIRL
                  You suck, Simon - you're going to
                  get my boyfriend killed before he
                  can get out of jail and fill me up
                  with his hot seed.

                              SIMON
                  Uh huh.

     Another GIRL - 17, cute, stoned - chimes in.

                            CUTE STONED GIRL
                  Simon, I just wanna play you.
                  Forget about that star-fucker.

                            ANNOYING GIRL
                  Shut up bitch.

     SIMON casually waves his hand at the frame, like flicking at
     a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED GIRL
     to the forefront.

               Thanks baby. When can I meet you
               for like reals?

     SIMON notices a metallic sparkle from the GIRL'S TONGUE.

                         SIMON
               What is that?
                   (like a dentist)
               Aaaa.

     He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close as
     she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen
     wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh,
     TEN FEET HIGH.

                            SIMON (cont'd)
               Woah.

     He quickly unsqueezes, zooming back out. The GIRL'S eyes are
     rolled back in her head, euphoric; she's WASTED.

                         CUTE STONED GIRL
               You like me?

     A THIRD GIRL pops in, filling the opposite wall.

                         SHELLY
               What's up, loser?

                            SIMON
               Hey sissy.

     This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14.       Frosted up lips, eyes
     and hair like a Tokyo hooker.

                         SHELLY
               Mom says - let me see, go to
               college, move the fuck out, and...
               oh yeah, you're a sick retard,
               you're pathetic, and you smell like
               Jeffrey Dahmer.

                         SIMON
               Wanna make out?

                         SHELLY
               You wish. I can't wait til they
               cut you off, Simian.

     With a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen.

     TWO MORE video chats pop up - TWIN 21-YEAR OLD GIRLS,
     stupidly hot.

                   (star struck)
               Oh my god, it's really you!!!

     Suddenly all of SIMON's screens are filled with the TWINS.

                          SIMON
               Nice.

                         TWINS
                   (in unison)
               Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?

                   (shrugs)
               Uh, sure.

     They lift their shirts, GIRLS GONE WILD style.      Perfect perky
     C's with silver-dollar nipples.

                         TWIN 1
               Mmmmm, now that we have your
               attention, here's another offer you
               can't refuse.

                         SIMON
               Here we go.

     When TWIN 2 speaks, it is with a MAN'S VOICE. The accent is
     EASTERN EUROPEAN.

                         SIMON
               Question: do I look like I need the
               money? We've discussed this before
               - Kable is not for sale.

     SIMON snaps his fingers; all the windows close
     simultaneously.

     SIMON makes a clicking sound with his tongue in the new
     silence. Peace at last.

     BY THEMSELVES, the screens come BACK TO LIFE.

                            SIMON (cont'd)
               D'oh.

     The instant chat boxes are gone, replaced by a soundless,
     GRAINY VIDEO LOOP - there is something sinister about the lo-
     fi image... it looks like the feed from an old SURVEILLANCE
     CAM:

     Two men are sitting in a room... it's silent, but one of them
     seems to be SCREAMING - he lifts a gun...

                         SIMON (cont'd)
               What the fuh...?

     ... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD.
     Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats.

     When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON
     freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN.

     It's KABLE.

     A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time -
     we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ video
     prank earlier:

                            want to talk to him?

     Then, blinking, lo-fi in the lower right corner of the wall:

     You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
     So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel...

     PAVEMENT flies by... sun SLAMS rainbow flares into the
     lens... ROLLER SKATES break frame, outpacing us...

     We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE,
     skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly
     follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops,
     belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs...
     ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs...

     They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced
     with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face
     plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING
     PARTY!!!

     We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated,
     but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is
     heightened, off-kilter.

     On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a
     WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big
     plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS...

     A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS,
     totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS,
     out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The
     SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare
     legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but
     STILL GRINNING ecstatically...

     A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium
     balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of
     interest and breaks off SPRINTING FULL SPEED...

     People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on
     the ground... and in the middle of it all...

     CLOSE-UP: a SPARROW is pecking at a hunk of orange and yellow
     CANDY CORN.

     POP OUT WIDE to reveal that the BIRD is EATING OUT OF A
     GIRL'S HAND...

     This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt,
     fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind
     them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like
     someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to
     notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the
     middle of the PARK, looking around, lost.

     She spots a GUY standing by himself near a giant sculpture.
     She walks over to him; the BIRD flutters away.

     The GUY is young and attractive, dressed in casual business
     attire. He is wearing a PLASTIC PIG SNOUT on his face, tied
     with an elastic band.

                            GUY

     ANGIE strikes an exaggeratedly DEMURE, FLIRTATIOUS POSE -

     ANGIE laughs, a beat LATE. Across the street a WOMAN has
     hiked up her skirt, squatted down and is TAKING A PEE on the
     sidewalk.

                            GORGE/ANGIE
               I'm Nika.

               Do you want to go somewhere?

     She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time.

                         DALE/GUY
               We are somewhere.

     He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They
     start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS
     UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the
     other.

     He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the
     base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her;
     SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders...

     ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nearby
     building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has
     switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured
     prominently.

     She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involuntary
     MOAN that is more like a whimper...

     We get our first wider view of the room. Much more cramped
     than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated by a
     GIANT VIDEO SCREEN, but just the front wall... there are
     other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various
     spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR all
     over the floor.

     GORGE - late 30s, MORBIDLY OBESE - is contained by a massive
     automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals.

     The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOING
     FUCKING BALLISTIC, throwing shit at it and gesturing crazily
     to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying to
     get the image back. It's NOT HAPPENING.

     SOUND: SLUUURRRRRRRP.

     CASTLE is cruising downhill in a 360 degree THREE-DIMENSIONAL
     ENVIRONMENT that looks ABSOLUTELY REAL - except that he is on
     a STATIONARY BIKE, and the NEWS REPORT is floating in the air
     as a 3D WINDOW. He is wearing skintight Tour de France-style
     gear and SLURPING A SMOOTHIE, one hand on the handlebar, the
     other holding the cup.

                  Experts estimate   that the service
                  interruption may   end up costing K-

                  On a personal note - that shit was
                  fucking freaky.

                  Serious, these humanz cocksuckers
                  are getting out of control, and
                  someone should do something.

     CASTLE closes the WINDOW in his FIST.

62   INT. PRISON, WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT                                        62

     The SCREAM would be comical if it weren't so HORRIFIC.

     With a dozen CONS looking on: an ASIAN PRISONER is on his
     knees, FINGERS DEEP into the back of his own skull.

                            ASIAN PRISONER
                  GET IT OUT OF ME...!

     He rips into his BRAIN STEM with a tiny piece of busted
     RAZOR, hoping to pull out a chip, a wire, anything. He pulls
     out something, and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor
     - FRIED POTATOES. He lands on a couple of dumbbells, his
     head smashing into the weight bench, spinal cord SEVERED.

     KABLE looks on, impassive, emotion internalized.       GUARDS push
     through.

                            GUARD
                  What the hell happened to this one?

     An old black dude - LIFER - answers.

                            LIFER
                  Look like he escaped.

     The GUARDS roll their eyes; drag away the body.

                            GUARD
                  Back to your Jazzercise, girls...

     Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking
     sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it would
     look exactly like HACKMAN.

     HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in his
     ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to
     eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.

                              KABLE
                  Freak.

     FREEK is there.

                              FREEK
                  Tillmans.

                            KABLE
                  Who the hell is that?

                            FREEK
                  New dude, new dude... that's
                  Hackman. They say he killed a whole
                  mess of people, all kind of
                  people... one day he just walk up
                  and turn himself in, like he wanna
                  be inside or some shit... never
                  gonna run out of slayers long as
                  they got that kind of motherfucka

     Now HACKMAN is looking at KABLE dead blank. A GUARD comes up
     behind HACKMAN and SHOVES HIM. HACKMAN turns; the GUARD
     gestures him to follow.

                            HISPANIC GUARD (O.C.)
               Hey Kable.

     KABLE turns to look.

                         HISPANIC GUARD (cont'd)
               Let's go. Upgrades.

                                                        CUT TO:

63   EXT. PRISON, TRAINING RANGE    - NIGHT                        63

     KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a
     massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically
     projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other
     PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot.

     KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his
     weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET...

     We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of
     target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and
     several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This
     thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out
     VICINITIES.

                            HISPANIC GUARD
               Who aims?

                         KABLE
                   (caught off guard)
               What?

                         HISPANIC GUARD
               Who aims... the slayer? Or the
               player?

     KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other
     PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACKMAN.

                         KABLE
               Not much to aiming... it's just
               hand/eye coordination. I'm the
               hand... someone, somewhere else is
               the eye.

                         HISPANIC GUARD
               That's tripped.

     KABLE glances at the GUARD... he struggles - part of him
     feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being
     grateful for the human interaction.

                             KABLE
                  Sometimes... they take over - you
                  know, completely. They move you.
                  Like a robot.
                      (beat)
                  But it doesn't work so good... that
                  part's just for show. You can't
                  really fight that way.

                            HISPANIC GUARD
                  Why?

                            KABLE
                  There's a delay...

                            HISPANIC GUARD
                  Yeah, the ping... they talk about
                  that. The time it takes the slayer
                  to respond to the command... it's
                  like, five millisecond ping, eight
                  millisecond ping...

     KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN.

                            KABLE
                  Whatever you call it. A slice of a
                  second is the difference between
                  living and dying out there. When
                  the trigger pulls -

     He pulls the trigger: a meaty CLICK.

                            KABLE (cont'd)
                  It's just me.

64   INT. PRISON LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT                                   64

     KABLE is ALONE, toweling off - privilege of being a TOP
     SLAYER.

     We see now   the DAMAGE his body has taken - he is covered in
     dark, ugly   BRUISES from BULLET HITS the body armor has
     absorbed -   including a flinch-inducing cluster of BLACK, BLUE
     AND YELLOW   from the most recent session.

     From down the row of lockers, a WHISPER:

                            HACKMAN
                  Hey. Kable.

     KABLE turns to look. HACKMAN'S head is POKED OUT sideways
     from around the corner; he's maybe 20 feet away.

                            KABLE
                  Not interested.

                            HACKMAN
                  No. Wait. Look.

     He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they are
     SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD.

                            HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I just deleted someone.

     HACKMAN is almost GIGGLING, high on it.

                            HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  This is the blood. Look.

     HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; he
     nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to call
     the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement.

                            HACKMAN (cont'd)
                  He's back here. Want to see?

                            KABLE
                  Your head ain't on straight.

     HACKMAN cracks his neck. Maybe not. KABLE pulls on his
     PRISON GREYS quickly, refusing to make EYE CONTACT.

                            HACKMAN
                  I'm going to delete you too. On
                  Sunday.

                            KABLE
                  Yeah, probably.

                            HACKMAN
                  That's why they put me here.

     KABLE'S eyes narrow - What?

     HACKMAN disappears; he starts to move along an ADJACENT ROW
     OF LOCKERS, slamming the doors - SINGING fucking PINOCCHIO:

                            HACKMAN (cont'd)
                  I've got no strings... So I have

                  But you can see
                  There are no strings on me...

     KABLE tenses up, ready for INSTANT VIOLENCE.

                          HACKMAN (cont'd)
                You got two whores, Kable...

     If he didn't have KABLE'S attention before, THIS GOT IT.

                          KABLE
                - the fuck did you say?

                          HACKMAN
                On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I
                meant your pretty girls... You want
                to get back to them but I'm going
                to visit them first...

     KABLE is instantly ALL BUSINESS - he's going to make HACKMAN
     disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW...

     He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE
     SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another...
     another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

     NOWHERE.

     KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hinges.

65   INT. CASTLE ESTATE - TIME INDETERMINATE                               65

     The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives and
     spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in three
     dimensions.

                          CASTLE
                He's so perfect.

     Snap out to reveal CASTLE in a dark lounge; the walls and
     ceiling are pure black, making it impossible to tell the
     dimensions of the room. Minimalist, expensive looking
     furniture is scattered around. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE
     ROOM.

     CASTLE is standing, bare feet on white shag carpet. He is
     manipulating the image of HACKMAN in the air by pulling,
     squeezing, twisting with his hands - the interface is similar
     to the one in SIMON'S room.

     CASTLE is as pumped as a kid on Christmas morning. Then, from
     behind him:

                          CASTLE 2
                He's scary.

     in the room behind him.

                              CASTLE
                  Yeah...

     He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better view -

     Another CASTLE appears to CASTLE'S left.

                            CASTLE 3
                  He's right.

     CASTLE faces them.

                      (unaffected)

                  their eyeballs, so vivid it's like
                  you can reach out and feel the wet
                  flesh - Trust me, they'll change
                  their point of view.

                            CASTLE 2
                  How can you be sure?

                  It's human nature. They'll be
                  seduced by the power, the
                  violence... the dominance...

                            CASTLE 3
                      (shaking his head)
                  Guess we never figured on Kable
                  blowing up as big as he did.

                         CASTLE
               Bigger than the game? No. Then
               again, who ever would've imagined a
               player could last over a dozen
               sessions with the same I-con...

                         CASTLE 2
               Tillman is a perfect soldier, a
               tactical killing computer - you
               dropped him in with common
               murderers. What did you expect?

                         CASTLE 3
                   (musing)
               His instincts give him an edge.

                         CASTLE 2
               And in the hands of a talented
               player...

                         CASTLE 3
               Of course we can never let him out.
               Not after what we did to him.

                         CASTLE 2
               Tell me again why we don't just get
               rid of the problem...
                   (makes a throat slashing
                    motion)
               You know, off camera?

     CASTLE pokes a finger at CASTLE 2.

                         CASTLE
               YOU - lack a flair for marketing.
               The people would never accept that.
               They need to SEE their gladiators
               brought down.

                         CASTLE 3
               One thing I know is what makes
               people tick.

     Suddenly the room has gone dead silent. We swing the camera
     around to reveal that CASTLE 3 is all alone in the room. He
     stares into the void, calm and utterly in control.

     The CAMERA moves past his head into PURE BLACK...

     The black of the underground tunnel... the TUNNEL LIGHTS
     streak past like vanishing stars... TRAIN TRACKS blur by...

67   INT. TUNNEL #2 - DAY                                                   67

     KABLE is SPRINTING down the TUNNEL towards DAYLIGHT.          The
     VOICE comes from the rear surrounds:

                         VOICE (O.S.)
               Kable, dude. It's me.

     KABLE shakes his head, thinking he's HEARING THINGS.

                            KABLE
               Who?

                          SIMON (O.S.)
               Simon.
                   (beat)
               I'm playing you, dummy.

     KABLE knifes through the tunnel EXIT...

68   EXT. SPAWN POINT #3 - CONTINUOUS                                       68

     We are in the OVER-THE-SHOULDER POV of the FLY CAM as KABLE
     breaks daylight and slides down the hillside... superimposed
     over the IMAGE: SIMON'S REFLECTED FACE... the CAMERA pans,
     centers and FOCUSES IN on the REFLECTION...

     SNIPER BULLETS whistle by; KABLE DUCKS, ROLLS... the CAMERA
     PULLS BACK... OUT OF THE SCREEN...

69   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                         69

     ... past the flesh and blood SIMON into an OVER-THE-SHOULDER -
     SIMON controlling KABLE, PLAYING HIM - as...

     KABLE LANDS in the ROCKSTAR POSE. SIMON mirrors him in front
     of the GIANT SCREEN - whatever SIMON does, KABLE echoes.

70   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS                                70

     KABLE makes it to cover, HEART SLAMMING.           We hear the distant
     THUMPS of MORTARS LAUNCHING.

                         KABLE
               How come I can hear you?

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               It's a mod.

                  I know.

71   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                   71

     SIMON POP-LOCKS - the breakdance arm wave.

                            SIMON
                  It's cool, yeah?

72   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS                            72

     KABLE finishes the POP-LOCK - it's goofy.

     A SHELL impacts the dirt nearby and BLOWS A MASSIVE CRATER in
     the firma; KABLE shields himself from the raining DEBRIS and
     scrambles for better cover.

                            KABLE
                  No. Pay attention to the game.

     They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of
     BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE gets
     there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAULT
     SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN.

     Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE,
     TRIANGULATING.

     KABLE ROLLS - BIG AMMO displacing the air just inches above
     his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONED
     CAR behind him - switches TURRETS and comes up FIRING...
     armor-piercing shells: BOOM. BOOM.

     A 180 spin... BOOM.      MINUS three BLUES.

73   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                                   73

     In QUICK CUTS we see SIMON striking BADASS poses; on the 3D
     screen KABLE ECHOES THEM - it's like a SYNCHRONIZED DANCE.

                                                             CUT TO:

74   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3/COVER - CONTINUOUS                            74

     KABLE keeps moving - he passes a BLUE, on his knees in the
     mud; The BLUE has completely LOST HIS SHIT.

                            BLUE SOLDIER 4
                  This is real, this is real, this is

     KABLE doesn't bother to shoot him; he's UNARMED. But...

     SHHHTUNK. A 50 CALIBER SHELL connects from somewhere distant
     and the BLUE is VAPORIZED, a smear on the pavement.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  That was sick.

                            KABLE
                  Wait a minute... are you twelve?

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  I'm nineteen.

                            KABLE
                  Bullshit. This is unbelievable.
                  How am I not dead yet?

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.

     KABLE doesn't even register this. His darting eyes pick up a
     familiar face in the chaos: FREEK.

     FREEK has apparently volunteered as a generi-con - he is
     dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he
     walks across the street.

                            FREEK
                      (mumbling)
                  Gotta keep my holes down... keep
                  `em down. Freek's gonna make it,
                  gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna
                  burn this joint...

     It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREEK
     and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes
     off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire -
     the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do.

     An explosion nearby pushes them forward.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Gibs.

                            KABLE
                  What?

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits.
                  Chunks. Pieces.

               Death row psychos, so what?          They
               had it coming.

     An exposed concrete stairwell leads into the bowels of a
     collapsed building; it looks like it must've gotten the
     OKLAHOMA CITY treatment in the early 2000s.

75   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING - STAIRWELL                             75

     But there's still juice feeding the dim FLUORESCENTS... KABLE
     makes his way DOWN. A distant voyeur's POV - maybe a
     sniper's telescopic sight? - observes KABLE disappearing
     underground.

                         KABLE
               Guess that goes for me too.

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Yeah, but you're different.

                         KABLE
               Different how?

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY
               psycho.

76   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - CONTINUOUS                      76

     He emerges in an UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL. Forty or fifty
     cars and SUVs, 2000-2009, lie dormant, covered in dirt,
     dust, and debris. KABLE switches on a LIGHT built in to his
     weapon.

     The FLY CAM scans 360 degrees, independent of KABLE, giving
     them two sets of eyes.

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Damn, new area.

     KABLE nods toward an EXIT at the opposite end, marked P-4.

                           KABLE
               That way.

     They make for it.

                  we've been through together. What
                  an epic run.
                      (beat)

     KABLE emerges several blocks from where he started, on a
     narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat.
     Buildings shelter the street on either side... several blocks
     down a LOW WALL BLOCKS THE ROAD - marked with RED DIAGONAL
     STRIPES and a warning: RESTRICTED.

                            KABLE
                  We should go that way.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  There's nothing there.

                            KABLE
                  Kid, trust me - I was going house
                  to house in Tehran while you were
                  still sucking mommy's nipple.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                      (sarcastic)
                  Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the
                  visual, but it's a restricted area.
                  It's beyond the borders of the
                  game. I couldn't put you there if I
                  tried.

     KABLE just grunts; his eyes steal a last look down the block.
     They head the other way...

     THOOM.

     CLOSE RANGE: a big ass armor piercing MORTAR SHELL PASSES IN
     FRONT OF KABLE'S FACE...

     Time STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air an
     inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple from
     the displaced air...

     then, REAL TIME - we whip around to follow the mortar as it
     whistles into concrete and BLOWS OUT the front of a building.

     KABLE is running.

78   EXT. BATTLEGROUND #3 - CRUSHED RIOT VAN                              78

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  ... shit shit shit!

     He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the
     direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the impact
     still raining down... and then:

     From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of
     IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN.

     HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S
     hand; it skitters across the concrete.

     SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no
     time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every
     move pings a step late...

     KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is
     moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control.

     HACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING
     HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty,
     high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points
     the barrel at his    FACE.

                             HACKMAN
                      (friendly)
                  Bye Kable.

     He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER...

     The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP.

     The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down-
     cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and
     plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD.

     dudes look at him and back away... when he turns toward us we
     see why: half his head, shoulder and one arm are blown off...

     KABLE seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into HACKMAN'S
     BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pretzel
     and throws him off.

                            KABLE
                      (to himself)
                  Kid's gonna get me killed.

                  Hey.

     KABLE sees GUARDS appearing and BLUES hurrying away from
     ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the
     mortar... session complete.

     KABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and
     speaks directly into SIMON'S ear:

                            KABLE
                  Listen to me. I don't know who's
                  behind it, or why, but I was
                  supposed to die today. They're
                  gunning for us. I can beat them,
                  but not with you controlling me.

                            SIMON
                  What the hell...?

     This is unthinkable, dangerous talk.

                            KABLE
                  Turn me loose, kid.        You want to
                  win, turn me loose.

                               SIMON

                            KABLE
                  Find a way.

     A drab brownstone apartment.

     Shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight; the
     interior is mute, faded - claustrophobic. KABLE has his cell;
     even though ANGIE is on the outside, and free, her
     environment seems to parallel his.

     A worn-out photo is taped to the fridge: the same little girl
     in KABLE'S picture.

     She stands in front of a closet mirror in the bedroom,
     looking herself over. She's FULLY DRESSED... but not like we
     saw her in society. Conservative. Pretty. NORMAL. She
     rehearses a friendly smile, but has difficulty not breaking
     into tears.

     ANIMATED, COLORED LIGHT leaks in from outside through the
     dark window blinds behind her - some sort of projected
     advertising?

     CUT TO: same room, later. ANGIE sits on the unmade bed. She
     searches through her purse for a PILL JAR, rattles a few into
     her hand... she DRY SWALLOWS them... leans forward, eyes
     shut, struggling NOT TO PASS OUT... she has to pull herself
     together somehow... the CAMERA pushes past her, toward the
     window, where the ANIMATED COLORS play 24-7...

     wide view of the outside of the building, a rundown
     brownstone on a rundown street - animated advertising covers
     half the side of the structure...

     An ad for slayers is running - KABLE, in cinematic slo-mo,
     and superimposed in wall-height block letters:

85   INT. SOCIAL SERVICES INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY                      85

     ANGIE sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair; the light
     is flat, fluorescent... in front of her, behind a desk, is a
     no-nonsense Social Services CASEWORKER, late 30s, CUBAN.

                         CASEWORKER
                   (looks over her paperwork)
               So... Miss Roth.

     ANGIE delivers the smile we saw her rehearse with all the
     warmth she can muster; it's not convincing.

                         CASEWORKER (cont'd)
               Why are we here today... says you'd
               like to apply for custody of your
               child-

                          ANGIE
               Delia.   Her name is Delia.

     The CASEWORKER looks over the paperwork while ANGIE shifts in
     her seat... torture.

                         CASEWORKER
               Spouse incarcerated, life without
               possibility of parole. You use
               your maiden name.

                         ANGIE
               My husband - he... it's not
               entirely true, regarding his
               sentence. In fact, he's due to be
               released soon...

     She makes brief eye contact with ANGIE.

                         CASEWORKER
               Your husband was charged and
               convicted of first degree murder,
               Miss Roth. I can hardly consider
               his release, if it was to occur, to
               be a positive.

     This is not going well. ANGIE holds her tongue with all of
     her will, not wanting to make it worse. The CASEWORKER holds
     all the cards.

                         CASEWORKER (cont'd)
                   (changes subject, back at
                    the paperwork)
               You're... an actor?

     ANGIE nods.

                            ANGIE
                  I work in society.

                            CASEWORKER
                  Acting, is that what they call it?

                  It's a job.

     ANGIE is hanging on... be pleasant, be friendly, breathe...
     but INSIDE she wants to cry, to scream, to fucking EXPLODE.

                            CASEWORKER
                  Miss Roth. Your child has been...
                  exceedingly well placed. The new
                  family is very wealthy. She'll
                  never want for anything.
                      (leans in)
                  I understand you love your little
                  girl, but... do you really think
                  she'd be better off with people
                  like you?

                               ANGIE
                  Yes, I do.     I'm her mother.

     The CASEWORKER presses a buzzer, unlocking the door behind
     ANGIE.

                            CASEWORKER
                  We will give your application all
                  the consideration that it merits.

     The words burn into ANGIE like battery acid, but there's not
     a thing she can say.

86   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                        86

     SIMON is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling - a GIANT
     VIDEO SCREEN playing back key moments of that day's Slayers
     session in an endless loop. SIMON holds his fingers up in
     front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with
     little fluid movements of his hands.

     Suddenly the screen GLITCHES OUT, goes dead for a second -
     and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a
     GIANT FACE, surrounded by black, STARING DOWN AT HIM:

     HUMANZ BROTHER, early 30's; a savvy leader with an
     unforgettable presence.

     [ "I WANNA ROCK" continues...]

     One light... HACKMAN'S FACE, glistening with sweat, is the
     only thing partially visible in the inky black... the CAMERA
     slowly ZOOMS into his EYES... twin pools of MADNESS... of
     MURDER...

     CLOSE-UP of the FADED PHOTO... gold hair, innocent
     laughter... KABLE runs his thumb across it tenderly,
     caressing the lines...

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                      (whispering)
                  Tillman.

     KABLE looks up. It's the SAME VOICE as before - the one that
     gave him the photo.

                               KABLE
                  You.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  We know you talked to him... your
                  Player.

                            KABLE
                  You're not a guard... who are you?

                               WOMAN (O.S.)
                  A friend.

                            KABLE
                  I don't have any.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  Listen to me: Simon's going to give
                  you what you want. What you asked
                  him for.

                            KABLE
                  How do you know that?

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  I know something else: whether or
                  not he's controlling you, you will
                  never reach the save point. Castle
                  won't allow it.

                               KABLE
                  We'll see.

                            WOMAN (O.S.)
                  No. Listen to me, Tillman - the
                  game is unwinnable - they will not
                  let you live. If you're want to
                  get out and see the people in the
                  picture you'll have to find another
                  way.

     KABLE doesn't answer; he absorbs her words, wondering if he
     can believe them... finally:

                            KABLE
                  I need you to get me something.

               What, Kable... what can I get you?

     KABLE stares into the DARK, turning it over in his head, then
     looks up at the WINDOW in the door, a simple black rectangle -
     and on the other side, his only LIFELINE.

                          KABLE
               Drunk.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

89   INT. STAGING ROOM - TIME INDETERMINATE                                89

     BLACK.

     Overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life, revealing a
     CLAUSTROPHOBIC ROOM - four walls, metal grating underfoot -
     and A LOCKER. KABLE is in his COMBAT BROWN.

     He PRINT ACTIVATES the locker. The WEAPON is there... and
     something else: a wrinkled BROWN PAPER BAG. What the hell?
     He takes it out, trying not to glance too obviously at the
     overhead SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

     CUT TO the POV from the CAM: KABLE is opening the bag...

                         VOICE (O.C.)
               What's he got there?

     BACK in the room. Inside the brown bag is a FIFTH OF VODKA.
     KABLE quickly slips it into his side cargo-pocket.

                         VOICE (cont'd)
               Kable, what the hell is that?!

     Behind KABLE a DOOR SLIDES OPEN automatically, revealing a
     CONCRETE TUNNEL, like the PLAYERS' entrance to a FOOTBALL
     STADIUM... the WHITE LIGHT is BLINKING ON and OFF... SOLDIERS
     sprint for the daylight, trying to escape the TORTURE... it's
     CHAOS.

                         VOICE (cont'd)
               Fuck-face - remove the `molotov'
               from your pants and discard into
               the recycle bin, now!

     KABLE grabs the bottle from his pocket, struggling to
     maintain as the LIGHT slams into his brain, AGONY.

                         VOICE (cont'd)
               PUT IT DOWN!

     ALL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS POINT AT KABLE. KABLE - no choice -
     makes the decision, twists the cap, tilts his head back, and
     SLAMS THE ENTIRE BOTTLE.

     He wails the BOTTLE at one of the CAMERAS, shattering it -
     and joins the others rushing into combat.

90   EXT. SPAWN POINT #4 - MOMENTS LATER                                90

     KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND
     ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles
     ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the
     bottom.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                      (sarcastic)
                  I can see turning you loose was a
                  great idea.

                            KABLE
                      (woozy)
                  What happened.

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  YOU happened, jackass. You wanted
                  control, you got it.

     KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID
     WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA,
     which is kicking in INSTANTLY...

                               KABLE
                  No shit...

                             SIMON (O.S.)
                  Yeah, that's right. So please don't
                  fuck up...

     An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING,
     DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD...

91   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                       91

     He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from
     reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his
     vision doubles and bleeds...

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  What's the matter with you Kable?
                  Kill something!

     BLUES. Lots of them.        KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING
     NOTHING.

92   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4                                        92

     KABLE is running erratically at least... hard to HIT... but
     definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE.

     A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet;
     the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting
     air...

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                      (frustrated)
                  Fuck it.

     We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER...

     KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the
     SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down
     on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss
     cheese.

     Too close.

                            SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
                      (the voice of reason)
                  Kable. Listen: it's the last game.
                  You're going to be dead and I'm
                  going to look like a total asshole
                  if you don't pull your balls
                  together!

                               KABLE
                  Blow me.

     He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the
     UNDERGROUND GARAGE.

                               SIMON (O.S.)
                  Dammit!

93   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL - MOMENTS LATER                      93

     KABLE slams open a door marked P4 and stumbles into the CAR
     GRAVEYARD...

     Reality is ROARING, SPINNING... KABLE slams into the side of
     a parked car, legs rubber... he looks it over - TIRES FLAT,
     NO GOOD... he stumbles to the next, then another...
     another... his head hits a passenger side window,
     SPIDERWEBBING IT...

     FINALLY, the ONE: A FORD F-250 SUPER CHIEF... GUN METAL GREY,
     PRISTINE.

     Note: the F-250 is a CONCEPT TRUCK - a future design for
     FORD'S F-line. In our world this is a 2009 factory model,
     which makes it old, but not antique. The truck is about as
     BADASS as you could want, with dark, narrow windows, big ass
     wheels and a FRONT END that looks like it could PUNCH THROUGH
     A BUILDING OR TWO.

     KABLE gets to the FUEL CAP DOOR and pries it open... ENGRAVED
     under the cap is a prominent WARNING:

                                  Ethanol Only

                            SIMON (O.S.)
                  Kable. Dude. What are you doing?

     KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat.

     Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on
     the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK.

                            SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  What the hell?

     He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the
     feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain down
     the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KABLE
     brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITHOUT
     LOOKING. His head is clearing.

     KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE
     TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless.

     KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he's
     regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVER'S
     SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A
     BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS THE
     IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK...

     BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole
     into the dashboard.

     KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HACKMAN and six
     other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast.

                            SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  GO, GO, GO!

                  cheerleader?

     VRUUUUUM, VRUUUM... KABLE hammers on the pedal again,
     knocking out the old ghosts - VRROOOOOOMM!!

     He SLAMS it into gear and PEELS OUT.

     HACKMAN leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points
     50mm directly at the side of KABLE'S head. In a split instant
     KABLE grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up -

     BOOM! A close range shell blows through the roof of the
     truck. KABLE slams the brakes, spinning the truck, and
     launches HACKMAN into a row of parked cars.

     HACKMAN gets in one last shot as KABLE punches it out of the
     garage, disintegrating a concrete column.

                         HACKMAN
               Fuuuuck!!!!

     He slams his head into the windshield of a parked car, caving
     it in.

94   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING) - MOMENTS LATER      94

     KABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires
     shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and
     TAKES OFF...

     He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA.

95   INT/EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #4/F250 (DRIVING)                  95

     The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the
     truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING
     GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture -
     now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA
     forward, next to the driver's window...

     The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a
     mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head.

                         SIMON (O.S.)
               Kable, PLEASE... get back in the
               game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS,
               KABLE!!!

     KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the
     window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way,
     barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the
     window of a building. Bye, FLY.

                                                        CUT TO:

      SIMON'S screen is filled with a GLITCHED OUT view of NOTHING,
      under a pile of glass and concrete.

                          SIMON
                Um.

97    EXT. SLAYERS RESTRICTED AREA - CONTINUOUS                       97

      The SUBMARINE ALARM is sounding across the BATTLEGROUND.
      KABLE is heading deep into RESTRICTED TERRITORY, slamming
      through and swerving around obstacles.

98    INT/EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                         98

      WITHOUT WARNING: a SNOWPLOW comes blasting out of nowhere
      going 80, trying to ram the driver's side... it's a tick
      late, clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a
      SPIN... KABLE is knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over
      the passenger seat. He recovers, straightens out and keeps
      going.

                          KABLE
                    (relieved)
                Ughh, that was the one.

      SIMON is switching from CAMERA to CAMERA, trying to pick up a
      view of KABLE... finally he comes across a RUMBLING CHASE
      CAM, coming up on KABLE'S truck from behind...

100   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING) - SIMULTANEOUS              100

      The CAMERA is mounted on a SNOWPLOW, one of a pair gaining on
      KABLE, slamming through rubble and debris.

101   INT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                             101

      KABLE spots them in the REAR VIEW MIRROR.

      He SLAMS HIS HEAD against the steering wheel to clear it -
      despite the purge he's still pretty FUCKED UP.

      KABLE pops the driver's door and leans out, GETTING A BEAD on
      the nearest PLOW...

102   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  102

      From the SNOWPLOW'S POV we see KABLE leaning out, POINTING
      THE WEAPON AT US. Then big ass MUZZLE FLASHES: THOOM! THOOM!

                   Shit, shit, SHIT!

      A shell comes RIGHT AT US - the screen GLITCHES, FREEZES -
      and goes BLACK.

                               SIMON (cont'd)
                   I'm dead.

103   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING) - CONTINUOUS                        103

      In KABLE'S REAR VIEW: The LEAD SNOWPLOW SPINS OUT,
      hemorrhaging black smoke; then SLAMS into the SECOND, sending
      it into the side of a building.

104   INT. F250                                                               104

      KABLE'S TRUCK HICCUPS - FUEL is on EMPTY, but still charging
      ahead.

105   INT/EXT. RESTRICTED AREA/F250 (DRIVING)                                 105

      A LOW CONCRETE WALL surrounds the perimeter, and it's COMING
      UP FAST; beyond it: more abandoned urban wasteland.

      KABLE has got too much speed at this point to do anything but
      slam the thing SIDEWAYS into a SICK POWER SLIDE - the TRUCK
      hits the barrier and FLIPS OVER IT, CORKSCREWING four times
      before GRINDING TO A STOP on it's hood. The AIRBAGS DEPLOY,
      smashing KABLE into his seat...

106   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA - SUBWAY ENTRANCE                                  106

      KABLE scrambles out of the vehicle; he spots a half collapsed
      SUBWAY ENTRANCE and runs for it...

107   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA - SKY                                              107

      Behind him, two SMART MISSILES are streaking high across the
      grey sky... they change direction and DOUBLE THEIR SPEED -
      it's fucking HORRIFIC... and CONVERGE on the downed TRUCK in
      an EYEBLINK.

      BOOM.

108   EXT. RESTRICTED AREA - SUBWAY ENTRANCE                                  108

      KABLE is LIFTED OFF HIS FEET and blown into the SUBWAY
      ENTRANCE, which COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK.

      The FRAT GUYS are standing there with their beers, frozen,
      mouths hanging open.

      On screen is a THREE DIMENSIONAL TEST PATTERN accompanied by
      a SEXY FEMALE VOICE:

                of the Slayers phenomenon next to
                Ken Castle himself - is officially

111   INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - DAY                                     111

      A drab, above ground commuter train; somehow reminiscent of
      the train to the slayers battleground - except the population
      here is strictly civilian: young, eccentric, mostly
      attractive, but their eyes are burned out, dead... lost.
      Dishwater daylight filters through the windows.

      The news broadcast continues, fed over video monitors that
      line the ceiling of the train. The passengers' eyes are glued
      to the screens...

      GRAFFITI on concrete, stenciled:

                          slayers is bad tv - humanz

      KABLE is standing across the street from a BEAT DOWN
      BROWNSTONE, watching the second floor window.

      A funky OFF-ROAD MOTOCROSS BIKE buzzes by him and up onto the
      sidewalk, FARTING SMOKE. KABLE IGNORES the RIDER, who parks,
      gets off, loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side.

                             TRACE
                   She's not home.

      KABLE turns - the RIDER is a green-eyed 22 year-old girl w/
      black rimmed WEEZER glasses; SMART AND CUTE as hell... this
      is TRACE.

                              TRACE (cont'd)
                   But Castle's personal security will
                   be, soon enough - trust me, you
                   don't want to meet them.
                       (beat)
                   You know, it's pretty obvious that
                   you'd come here first.

                             KABLE
                   Who are you?

      TRACE smiles.

                             TRACE
                   You asked me that once before.

                   Your voice...

      We might recognize it too - it's the VOICE from the other
      side of the CELL DOOR.

                             TRACE
                   You should really come with me...

      She glances skyward toward the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS.

                             TRACE (cont'd)
                   ... like, NOW.

      KABLE considers his options...

      They TAKE OFF on the MOTO, TRACE driving.

113   EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - DAY                                      113

      TRACE darts nimbly thru traffic and pedestrians, finally
      ZAGGING up onto the sidewalk and down a side alley...

114   EXT. ALLEY - ADULT STORE ENTRANCE                                   114

      She CUTS HARD 90 degrees, straight into it, leaving tread on
      the concrete - through hanging black rubber strip curtains...

115   INT. ADULT STORE - NARROW STAIRWELL                                 115

      and STRAIGHT DOWN A NARROW STAIRWELL, taking the stairs
      MOTOCROSS...

      She cuts HARD RIGHT at the bottom...

      ...down a concrete corridor and onto a minimal FREIGHT
      ELEVATOR - open on the sides... punches the down button, BIKE
      still idling... KABLE coughs from the fumes...

      Halfway down there is a SQUARE OPENING in the wall of the
      elevator shaft - a TUNNEL TO BLACK.

                   Hang on.

      POPS IT. They're GONE.

117   INT. HUMANZ HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER                             117

      A DARK, underground VIDEO ARCADE... low ceilings, concrete;
      OLD SCHOOL - sort of a graveyard of lost games... the
      classics of the 80s - MISSILE COMMAND, DEFENDER, ROBOTRON,
      CRANK, etc. The dimensions of the room are impossible to
      determine. A dozen or so PEOPLE - just BLACK SILHOUETTES in
      the CATHODE RAY GLOW - are scattered around, banging buttons,
      giving it body english, racking up scores.

      TRACE leads KABLE through, toward the one BRIGHTLY LIT SPOT:
      at the center of the arcade, an AIR HOCKEY table is blasted
      with WHITE LIGHT from above. HUMANZ BROTHER, who we
      recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid 20s,
      long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK,
      CLACK...

      They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear
      to notice KABLE.

      HUMANZ BROTHER smacks a random 3-bank           WINNER.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   You a fool.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Stop playing that freaky shit off
                   the rail.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   It's a game of deception.

                             HUMANZ DUDE
                   Whatever, that's cuz you got no
                   power...

      HUMANZ DUDE measures a shot, rolling the paddle with one
      finger - then LETS IT RIP - slamming the GAME WINNER in a
      STRAIGHT LINE past HUMANZ BROTHER'S frozen paddle - SCORE: 7-
      5.

      They turn, suddenly aware of him. HUMANZ DUDE'S paddle hand
      goes limp; the puck limps in and scores, meaninglessly.

                   You made it. You're really here.

      KABLE looks them over - he's not sure what he expected, but

                   Hey, Kable...

      DUDE seems to be the most affected by KABLE'S presence -
      BROTHER is calm, in the moment; TRACE is focused, all
      business... DUDE is pure FANBOY.

                             HUMANZ DUDE (cont'd)

                   A few.

      He glances over at TRACE.

118   INT. FBI INTERROGATION - TIME INDETERMINATE                         118

      SIMON is in a stark interrogation room, alone, drumming his
      fingers on the table - thumb-to-pinky, pinky-to-thumb. Trying
      not to show how scared he is.

      The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We only
      see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup.

      The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to
      SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he can
      manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being
      interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls.

      When AGENT KEITH speaks, he is calm, conversational.

                          AGENT KEITH
                Guess you remember that day.

      SIMON nods, noncommitally.

                   last that long.

      Another photo shows SIMON on a JUMBOTRON posing with his
      fingers in the camera's face, throwing the motion control
      hand signal for FIRE and KILL... in another, he's being
      mobbed at an event, signing an amazing pair of breasts with a

      ANGIE is on the sidewalk, a little unsteady on high heels -
      wearing the outfit GORGE CHOSE.

      OTHER PEOPLE are wandering around everywhere. A DEBUTANTE-
      type in a pink ensemble has a poofy SHITZU on a leash; the
      SHITZU is PISSING ON IT'S OWNER'S LEG, but she doesn't seem
      to notice. A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in the
      back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking.

      She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go,
      without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH?

      ANGIE walks around the corner to a BAR and goes in.

121   INT. THORAX BAR - CONTINUOUS                                            121

      The THORAX BAR is small, intimate, but ULTRA-STYLED... the
      theme is insect. All manner of exotic bug preserved in
      glass, suspended in ice... one wall is a giant, black-lit ANT

      people lounge on plush seating, gobbling up creatively
      prepared bug delicacies - FRIED PINK GRASSHOPPERS, fat yellow
      GRUBS with red chili oil...

      ANGIE takes a seat at the BAR.

                   The usual?

      She just WINKS, flirtatious.

      The BARTENDER returns a smile and shakes up an AQUA BLUE

      She takes a SIP, letting the LARVA curl around her tongue...

      In GORGE'S apartment his lips move, ANGIE'S echoing to match.

                             ANGIE (cont'd)
                   I thought you weren't allowed to
                   come here anymore.

      RICK RAPE laughs, throwing his head back and slapping his
      knee - EXAGGERATED.

                             RICK RAPE
                   That was just last month. I was a
                   bad boy.

      ANGIE yawns.

      ANGIE EXITS the ELEVATOR on the 3rd floor - a modern,
      minimalist building... RICK RAPE is with her, close behind.

      They come to an apartment door; RICK RAPE pushes her, from
      behind, up against the door - VIOLENT... her right hand SLAPS
      a PALM IDENTIFICATION SENSOR alongside the door and it
      WHISPERS OPEN.

      ANGIE snaps a heel; they stumble in.

      ANGIE'S place is some kind of overdecorated, SCHITZOPHRENIC

      filter through patterned curtains.

      She crawls along a plush WHITE FUR RUG... RICK RAPE

      begins to UNBUTTON HIS PANTS. ANGIE, on her hands and knees,

      - KKRRUNCH.

      ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCLEAR
      with EMOTION.

      KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... then
      falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face in
      his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS.

      GORGE is paralyzed.

                   Please don't kill me.

      ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes.     KABLE
      just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation.

                             GORGE/ANGIE
                I can't.

      KABLE buries his face in his hands; it's TEARING HIM UP.

                          GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd)
                She has to say what I tell her.

      KABLE looks deep into ANGIE'S eyes.

                           KABLE
                     (almost whispering)
                You can hear me, baby. I know you
                can.

      He WIPES AWAY A TEAR from her cheek with his thumb.     After
      all he's been through he begins to BREAK DOWN.

                          KABLE (cont'd)
                I love you... love you...

                          GORGE/ANGIE
                I love you too.

                           KABLE
                    (snapping)
                SHUT UP!!!

      He's SCREAMING directly at GORGE, who cowers in his chair as
      if KABLE were in the room with him.

                          KABLE (cont'd)
                Say anything else and I'll find
                you... I'll rip you TO FUCKING
                PIECES, do you understand me?

      GORGE/ANGIE nods.

                          KABLE (cont'd)
                    (to ANGIE)
                I'm getting you out of here.

124   INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY                             124

      KABLE pulls ANGIE out the door and down the hall, in tactical
      mode, WEAPON ready... he heads to the ELEVATOR, punches up a
      ride. No sign of trouble.

                           KABLE
                    (quiet)
                I'm going to take you someplace
                where they can turn it off... the
                program...

      GORGE/ANGIE says NOTHING.       The ELEVATOR DOOR whispers open -

      HACKMAN is standing there with an ASSAULT SHOTGUN.

                              HACKMAN
                       (friendly)
                   Hi, Kable.

      BOOM.

      KABLE TAKES IT IN THE CHEST; he's BLOWN OFF HIS FEET, through
      a wall and into an apartment opposite the ELEVATOR.

      HACKMAN grabs ANGIE'S wrist, drags her onto the ELEVATOR and
      waits a BEAT, smiling pleasantly. The ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES.

125   INT. APARTMENT - DAY                                               125

      KABLE is ON HIS BACK in rubble. His chest is a BLACK,
      SMOKING HOLE... but as the smoke clears we see that his BODY
      ARMOR has ABSORBED THE BLAST. He's groggy, in excruciating
      pain, wind knocked out of him - but ALIVE.

      TWO GUYS in GAS MASKS and RUBBER SUITS are watching him from
      the next room as he attempts to STRUGGLE TO HIS KNEES; KABLE
      has obviously interrupted something.

126   INT. ELEVATOR - SIMULTANEOUS                                       126

      HACKMAN and ANGIE are having a pleasant ride down, HACKMAN'S
      hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - still
      smoking - shoulder strapped.

                             HACKMAN
                       (to ANGIE)
                   Anybody in there?

      The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLING,
      NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE.

      HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH
      BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide with
      TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious.

      GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his
      chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he
      speaks, ANGIE echoes:

                             GORGE/ANGIE
                   Come on... do it...

      HACKMAN raises his eyebrows - he wasn't expecting that one...
      but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL'S
      legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

      The GUY is confused - where'd she go? He looks to ANGIE.
      HACKMAN headlocks him from behind, and slowly - making eye
      contact with GORGE/ANGIE the entire time - SNAPS HIS NECK.

      ANGIE'S eyes stream tears; GORGE is in ECSTASY.

      HACKMAN lets the second body DROP, chuckling, as the ELEVATOR
      DOOR OPENS...

      KABLE is waiting.

127   INT. ANGIE'S BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                         127

      KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE
      ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to
      the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts
      with BLOOD.

      HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - the
      blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches;
      displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The
      BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall
      behind him, four inches deep.

      HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the
      SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move away,
      HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN
      FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes out
      a set of HACKMAN'S toes.

      KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings up
      his own WEAPON to close the deal...

      ... as the GLASS WALLS of the LOBBY EXPLODE.

      MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN.

      KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and
      breaks for the BACK EXIT.

128   EXT. SOCIETY - DAY                                                128

      KABLE and ANGIE hit WHITE HOT DAYLIGHT. A BLUE SLAYER breaks
      the corner of the building and KABLE FRAGS HIM.

      KABLE grabs ANGIE by the shoulders and yells directly at
      GORGE:

                              KABLE
                   YOU!   WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO?

      CONTINUOUS SHOT: GORGE/ANGIE starts running across the
      street, leading the way;

      KABLE takes out another BLUE at a distance, following close
      behind her. They run into a GENERIC, UNMARKED BUILDING...

129   INT. SOCIETY BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                                129

131   INT. UNDERGROUND RAVE - CONTINUOUS                                131

      ... a 24 HOUR UNDERGROUND RAVE, in full effect.

      This thing is FUCKING HUGE... in the DARK it's impossible to
      tell just how big... hundreds of writhing SOCIETY DUDES,
      CHICKS and OTHER... DAY-GLO, moving spotlights, strobes...
      the BUBBLE GIRLS from CRANK make an appearance... along with
      the DISCOVERY CHANNEL SKATERS from the PARK, now in GOTHED-UP
      GEAR...

      KABLE gathers it all... he takes ANGIE'S arm and begins to
      wade through the CHAOS... the BLOOD SPATTERS on his face POP
      in sharp, inverse DAY-GLO, like HARTIGAN'S SCAR in SIN
      CITY...

      A SKATER GIRL takes a hold of the glowing, smoking barrel of
      KABLE'S WEAPON and starts to SKATE CIRCLES around him, ring-
      around-the-rosie... he wrenches it hard, sending her flying
      into a crowd that goes down like BOWLING PINS.

      They continue MOVING... KABLE happens to notice RED LASERS
      moving through the DARK... probing... RAVE LIGHTS? No...

      THOOM.   THOOM THOOM.

      LIGHTNING FLASHES, EXPLOSIONS... a RAVER nearby
      disintegrates, BLOOD and GUTS a DAY GLO VOLCANO.      DANCERS
      slip and FALL ON THEIR ASSES in the viscera.

      The SLAYERS are moving thru the RAVE, hunting. Everyone but
      KABLE and ANGIE are so out of it they don't even notice.

                             KABLE
                       (to GORGE)
                   You. Run.

      ANGIE runs.

      KABLE goes COMMANDO, evading the HUNTERS, ducking under
      EXPLODING SHIT... he moves to FLANK them...

      GROOVE DON'T STOP...

      LIGHTNING STRIKES FREEZE the ACTION as KABLE engages the
      BLUES, one by one... he takes out THREE of them with CLOSE
      RANGE BLASTS and another HAND-TO-HAND-TO-HEADSNAP - then
      notices more BLUES moving in... too many...

      He catches up to ANGIE and they make for an EXIT, any EXIT...

      A SCOOBY DOO-looking VAN pulls up to the CURB in front of
      them; the back doors SWING OPEN.

                   I can get you out.

      Not much choice. KABLE and ANGIE climb in. The ELECTRIC VAN
      drives quietly away, attracting no attention.

135   INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS                                            135

      KABLE slumps against the wall of the VAN, cradling ANGIE in
      his arms - exhausted. ANGIE'S eyes are POST-TRAUMATIC,
      searching.

      GINA is PUMPED.

      ANGIE is lying on a      black leather couch, unconscious -

      fingertip and plops      a RED DROP into a glass tube of liquid.
      KABLE kneels beside      ANGIE, stroking her hair.

      Primitive, 8-BIT ARCADE DEMO SCREENS: missiles obliterate a
      city in MISSILE COMMAND, line-vector TANKS track 3D targets
      in BATTLEZONE, etc.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER (V.O.)
                   Ken Castle made his first billion
                   designing virtual reality
                   simulators for the US military.
                   Six years ago he brought them
                   something new - a breakthrough so
                   profound, he said, that history
                   would be divided up between
                   everything before and everything
                   that came after.

      HUMANZ BROTHER and KABLE walk through the DARK ARCADE, past
      rows of machines... the lights and patterns of 8-BIT DEMO
      SEQUENCES and HI SCORE SCREENS flash across their faces.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER (cont'd)
                   They tested it on soldiers... the
                   first volunteer was Corporal Travis
                   Scotch - a friend of yours, I
                   believe.

      They stop.

                             KABLE
                   Yeah. He was.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   The second was you.

      KABLE fights difficult memories.

                             KABLE
                   The idea was to replace your brain,
                   bit by bit, cell by cell,
                   gradual... the new tissue would
                   never break down, never
                   deteriorate.
                       (bitter)
                   A new era in human longevity is
                   what they told us. We were doing
                   the world a favor.

                              HUMANZ BROTHER
                       (nods)
                   Nine weeks later Scotch was dead
                   and you were serving life in
                   maximum. Castle's project was shut
                   down... but the shit wasn't a total
                   loss: the same technology
                   resurfaced within a year... in a
                   game. Castle called it society.

                             KABLE
                   Thank you for the history lesson.

                             HUMANZ BROTHER
                   Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened
                   in that project is something Castle
                   wanna be buried. We need that shit,
                   baby: what you saw, what you know.

                             KABLE
                   I don't know what to tell you.

      Slow PUSH IN on unconscious ANGIE. We hear TRACE interacting
      with HUMANZ TECHS off-CAMERA as a heart monitor BEEPS
      steadily.

                          TRACE (O.C.)

      GORGE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. He SPAZZES OUT like a turtle on it's
      shell, a moment of panic - he's been PASSED OUT in his chair
      and doesn't immediately know where he is. He looks around the
      DARK ROOM nervously; takes a hit of OXYGEN.

      On the SCREEN, society is gone - there is only a nebulous
      TEST PATTERN.

      Behind him, a SOUND.

                          GORGE
                Hooz there?

      He runs his hand along the CHAIR'S TRACKBALL CONTROL, it
      SPINS around and rolls forward a bit.

      CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD is standing in the room, silhouettes in
      the dark - scary.

140   INT. HUMANZ HEADQUARTERS, TECH ROOM - NIGHT                             140

      A screen glitches - pixellated, fucked up, highly compressed,
      like an internet feed through a busted satellite. We begin
      to make out a coherent image:

      It is a POV, walking, of an industrial corridor.            Cameras
      mounted and doors with square glass windows.

      We back away from the screen to reveal -

      HUMANZ DUDE, HUMANZ BROTHER and GINA PARKER SMITH are
      watching the image on a LO-FI computer monitor. HUMANZ DUDE
      runs his fingers along a touchpad, MOVING FREQUENCIES around
      on a WAVEFORM MONITOR, trying to dial the picture in better.

      We see KABLE through an OBSERVATION WINDOW, slumped over in a
      chair... DREAMING? Or just CONCENTRATING?

                             GINA PARKER SMITH
                   What are we looking at?

                   I read something about this. But
                   that tech is supposed to be a
                   decade away...

      HUMANZ DUDE smirks, shakes his head.

                   Current exponential rate of growth,
                   I can't imagine a piece of tech

      He bangs on a key, beating up the interface.

      KABLE - younger, in UNIFORM - walks down a sterile corridor.
      He is dead calm, emotionless.

      Tiny SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS track his movements.            He comes to a
      DOOR; it whispers open and he STEPS IN.

142   INT. MILITARY FACILITY, DEBRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    142

      A WHITE, MINIMAL ROOM - TABLE, TWO CHAIRS. We may recognize
      it from the VIDEO the humanz sent to SIMON. In one chair: a
      MAN, 30s, beard and mustache grown out thick; in UNIFORM.
      KABLE sits down in the other.

                             SCOTCH
                   Tillman. Never thought I'd be so

                   They got me hooked up to computers
                   five hours a day... nurses feeding
                   me vitamins, giving me shots,
                   wiping my butt - male nurses, I
                   might add...

                   What about you? You're dressed like
                   a semi-human being... they let you
                   out already?

      KABLE'S response doesn't match SCOTCH'S energy - he's bland,
      generic.

      KABLE'S "sorry" seems to refer to something only KABLE knows.

      A BEAT.   SCOTCH is suddenly conscious of the SURVEILLANCE.

      KABLE'S eyes flicker away from SCOTCH'S. He calmly removes
      his military issue .45 from it's holster and lets it rest on
      the table between them. He stares at it intensely, emotion
      starting to seep through the icy lines of his face.

      KABLE starts to shake; the gun rattles on the table top. A
      bead of sweat creeps down his forehead. It's apparent that
      he is locked in a paralyzing internal struggle...

      It seems to take all of KABLE'S strength to answer.                His
      voice is halting, human - not robotic like before.

      GINA PARKER SMITH is practically moist, visions of monster

                   do it.

                               HUMANZ BROTHER
                   A test.

      Everyone's eyes had been glued to it - now they look up,
      through the OBSERVATION WINDOW...

      The room is empty.       The CHAIR is knocked over on the floor;
      KABLE is gone.

150   INT. HUMANZ HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER                           150

      KABLE is slumped against concrete, on his knees... RELIVING
      THE MURDER has knocked the hell out of him, but he's DEALING
      WITH IT.

      A pair of SKINNY LEGS walk up and kneel next to him: ANGIE.

      He touches her face, looks deep into her EYES - they are wet
      with emotion.

                               KABLE
                   It's you.

      She just NODS.    They embrace... finally, for real.

                             ANGIE
                   I missed you... so much...

      ANGIE says nothing, just holds him tighter. KABLE pushes her             *
      hair back - he searches her eyes, desperate with emotion.                *

      ANGIE shakes her head, won't meet his eyes.

      corner.

      GINA fights to catch up to him. She gets a hand on his

      He BAILS, leaving her there.

      JUST THEN: matching BLACK SUVs pull up to the curb just TEN
      FEET from where she stands.

      CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD piles out... GINA sees them, recognizes
      them from the interview with CASTLE; she TURNS AWAY just in
      time to avoid being recognized by a GEEK as he scans the
      crowd.

      But they're not after her... they head straight for the
      ALLEY.

      blinded by harsh fluorescent light. He sits up on a cot,
      wearing a white T-shirt and pajama pants; fucked up hair,

      SIMON slides open the door to his room, peaks inside
      hesitantly.

      It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up
      electronics and garbage. The wall-sized screens are all
      running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD, repeated in columns,
      by the thousands - scrolling fast, a digital waterfall of
      words, white on black:

                                      CHEATER

      It's over.

      SIMON sits down in the middle of the detritus, in a state of
      mild SHOCK - he's LOST EVERYTHING.

      He gestures at the screen and closes out the SCROLLING
      LOOP... then once again, attempting to activate SLAYERS
      control; the screen shows the same nebulous TEST PATTERN we
      last saw on GORGE'S screen.

      CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY.

      Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract
      statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a
      soul in sight.

      KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass.               Wind in the leaves,
      cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE.

      He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central
      MANSION.

      THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across
      the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES...

      KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run
      RIGHT PAST HIM. They round a corner and DISAPPEAR. Weird.

      KABLE looks up, spots a CAMERA... and another, and another...
      stands to reason he's been MARKED already.

      He walks out INTO THE OPEN.

      The GIANT FRONT DOORS of the MANSION are OPEN.              KABLE walks
      right in.

      The interior is HUGE... and EMPTY. NO FURNITURE, no art; no
      people of course. Could anyone possibly live here?

      He explores...

156   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION - EMPTY HALL - NIGHT                                 156

      AND THEN - at the FAR END of a large, empty HALL:

      A LITTLE GIRL, 5 - is sitting on the floor by herself,
      playing with DOLLS, making them walk and talk.


                                                                     (CONTINUED)

      KABLE'S eyes go wide.        He starts to walk toward her, slowly
      at first...

                   Delia...

      ... and finally breaking into a run - until:

      He SLAMS into what seems to be an INVISIBLE WALL, crumpling
      to the ground. The GIRL doesn't react. KABLE pounds on the
      glass...

                                KABLE (cont'd)
                   DELIA!

      ... then looks closer, running his fingers across the SMOOTH
      SURFACE.

                             KEN CASTLE (O.S.)
                   Not bad for video, eh?

      The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS; it seems to be
      everywhere at once, intimate.

                             KEN CASTLE (O.S.) (cont'd)
                   The latest and greatest... defy you
                   to tell it from real life. You
                   imagine porn on this thing?

      KABLE wants to EXPLODE - but he contains himself. He's
      playing CASTLE'S GAME, and the RULES are still UNDEFINED.

      Then - MUSIC: The SOUND of a SWINGIN' HI-HAT from down a long
      corridor -

      t - t - tssss, t - t - tssss, t - t - tsss...

      KABLE walks toward the source; a bass and piano pick up the
      groove.

157   INT. CASTLE'S MANSION, BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS                        157

      He comes to a BALLROOM - empty, like everything else; shiny
      hardwood floor for DANCING.

      A SPOTLIGHT pops on from above, illuminating KEN CASTLE.
      He's wearing a T-SHIRT and JEANS. Every instinct tells KABLE
      to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's even
      real? And then CASTLE starts to SING...

      ... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I've
      Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOKE:

      I've got you under my skin

      I've got you deep in the heart of me
      So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
      I've got you under my skin...

      He's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... THEN -
      from behind curtains - a half dozen SLAYERS appear. We
      RECOGNIZE THE SCARRED, BATTLE-TOUGH FACES from the prison,
      the game, the pursuit... only instead of BLUE, they are
      wearing TUXEDOES with BLUE BOW-TIES.

      KABLE grips his weapon, but the men are UNARMED; instead,
      they fall in on the beat and go into a CHOREOGRAPHED DANCE
      behind CASTLE...

      I'd sacrifice anything come what might
      For the sake of having you near
      In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
      And repeats, and repeats in my ear...

      KABLE notices SHADOWY FIGURES around the perimeter of the
      room... glasses, beards, pony tails - silently, the GEEK
      SQUAD has moved in and taken position. They move their hands
      in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a
      DANCER: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS... kick
      with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a
      ROCKETTE.

      Suddenly, ON A MUSICAL HIT, everyone - CASTLE, the GEEKS, the
      SLAYERS - points dramatically up at the wall, where a VIDEO
      SCREEN BEGINS TO PLAY: it is footage of the GEEK SQUAD
      busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING
      EVERYONE. ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away.

      Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
      Use your mentality, wake up to reality...
      But each time I do just the thought of you makes me STOP -
      before I give in
      Cause I've got you, under my skin...

      KABLE hits his breaking point. He brings up his WEAPON to
      open up on the SLAYERS... CLICK. It's DEAD. The GEEKS have
      taken care of that.

      KABLE tosses it aside and sprints for CASTLE, but the SLAYERS
      break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out
      they're flesh and blood after all.

      CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his
      SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand
      combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces...
      it's a full-on BALLET OF DEATH... finally, THE MUSIC ENDS,
      right on cue: KABLE is finishing off the last of the men,
      blood on his hands.

      CASTLE walks away, leaving his back open to KABLE seemingly
      without concern, toward a side door.

      Tracking along the hallway, MEDIUM CLOSE, profile:

      CASTLE walks along, confidently, KABLE following. The
      background is a black, glittering STARSCAPE.

                          KEN CASTLE
                I've got to thank you for leading
                me to them, by the by - the human-
                zuzz that is...

      Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE OF
      THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and
      LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks
      along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are all
      tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET EARTH
      rising majestically in the dark heavens.

                          KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                Of course, soon enough they'd be
                whistling my tune like everybody
                else... but meantime it was that
                little cracker program they dreamed
                up that got my attention...

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   that was a genuine nuisance, no
                   doubt about it... One thing even
                   they didn't know, though: I'm wired
                   too.

      SNAP back to CASTLE, MEDIUM       CLOSE.     His eyes are FUCKING
      CRAZY.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   I replaced 98% of my own noodle
                   with nano-tissue years ago...

159   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                      159

      They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA
      regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard,
      bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one bank
      of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on.

      At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shooting
      baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is in
      a FLEX BRACE.

      The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   But mine's different.
                       (taps his FOREHEAD)
                   Built to send - to transmit .
                   Whereas every other K-soft cell out
                   there - including the ones in...
                       (taps KABLE'S forehead )
                   your head, Kable - is designed to
                   receive. I think it, you do it.

      CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him...
      HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   We're talking every Slayer,
                   everyone in Society City... I
                   believe your better half would fall
                   under that category... provided
                   they're within range of my
                   transmitters...

      CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs over,
      picks up the ball and resumes shooting.

                             KABLE
                       (sarcastic)
                   Very nice, Castle. So you've got an
                   army of psychotics and deviants to
                   dance around for you.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

      CASTLE narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he
      walks over to a bin of GRIP POWDER.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   You're thinking small, Kable. But
                   not as small as me.

      He sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and
      CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWAY
      FROM HIS FACE.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   See, nano cells are real small, a
                   thousand times smaller than even
                   these dust particulates...
                       (KABLE coughs)
                   Inhale it and they go to work:
                   replicating, spreading... like a
                   virus, multiplying in
                   exponentials... six months time I
                   could have 100 million people
                   converted - ditch diggers, porn
                   stars, presidents - and not one
                   would be the wiser.

      Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silently
      TURNS TOWARD US.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   A hundred million folks that will
                   buy what I want them to buy, vote
                   how I want them to vote, do pretty
                   much damn well anything I figure
                   they ought to do.

      HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, at
      a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE
      KNIFE...

                              KEN CASTLE(cont'd)
                   For instance.

      KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS THE
      TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style.
      KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it -
      but leaving his face UNPROTECTED...

      HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face,
      connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - this
      time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and
      WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder with
      a sickening POP.

      KABLE works around HACKMAN, gets him in a HEADLOCK and
      SQUEEZES... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it...
      HACKMAN is choking, BEAT RED... for long, brutal seconds the
      life drains out of him... finally, HACKMAN'S eyes roll back;
      he GOES LIMP. KABLE takes the BOWIE KNIFE from HACKMAN'S
      dead fingers.

      He struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood.

                          KABLE
                You should've let him fight for
                himself, Castle - he might've had a
                shot.

                          KEN CASTLE
                    (pleasant)
                I think you're missing the point,
                my man.

                          KABLE
                No, I get it - you're pulling the
                strings on all of this...
                    (starts to move toward
                     CASTLE with BAD INTENT)
                ... which makes my next move pretty
                easy to figure.

      KABLE comes at CASTLE FAST, bringing the KNIFE around to open
      his throat like a PEZ DISPENSER...

      His arm FREEZES IN MID AIR, the BLADE inches from contact.

                          KEN CASTLE
                Neglected to mention: my smart boys
                reversed that hack those fellas
                worked for you - easy breezy, once
                we had access to their drives...

      This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom, he
      feels his will ripped away from him... HE'S BEING PUPPETED BY
      THE MAN HE HATES THE MOST.

                          KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                You're mine, boy.

      With a twitch of CASTLE'S eyes KABLE brings the KNIFE down
      and SLICES OPEN HIS OWN LEG.

                                                        CUT TO:

160   INT. SIMON'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS                              160

      SIMON is sitting on the floor, head hung low, in front of the
      dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to life:

      It's KABLE'S POV of KEN CASTLE.          CASTLE is stripping off his
      shirt.

                             KEN CASTLE

                   Come on, lets boogie woogie rock

                   Ummm.

161   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                      161

      CASTLE throws a funky KARATE KICK and nails KABLE in the
      jaw... then a haymaker to the GUT, doubling KABLE over.

      He lets KABLE swing the KNIFE just short of his face as he
      backs away.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   Biggest, baddest Slayer in the
                   game... don't seem like much, does
                   he?

      CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself. He uppercuts
      KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his
      knuckles.

                              KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Oww!

      KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs it
      perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH,
      MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon. CASTLE
      strikes a pose to match.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Lucky shot.
                       (grins)
                   OK, not really.

      He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KABLE
      to the floor.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   I need an audience, boys.

      A DOOR OPENS at the far end of the court; KABLE looks up
      slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see:

      ANGIE and DELIA are led into the room. ANGIE presses herself                *
      close to DELIA, holding her shoulders protectively.                         *

                                                                (CONTINUED)

      She keeps her distance from the GEEK SQUAD escorts and tries            *
      to block DELIA from them - there is raw fear and anger in her           *
      eyes; the GEEK SQUAD are not overtly violent or menacing, but           *
      ANGIE seems acutely aware that they are lethal. DELIA seems             *
      oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation.                   *

      CASTLE kicks KABLE across the floor, toward them.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   That's right, you crawl on your
                   belly like a toad...
                       (he looks to the GEEK
                        SQUAD, sheepish)
                   Is this bad? I'm really bad.

      He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of his
      DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously.                           *

      He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to               *
      ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we feel             *
      that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of              *
      what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking           *
      to KABLE for a clue.                                                    *

      KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and                 *
      gently touch her face...

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   That's sweet.

      CASTLE steps on KABLE'S hand, pinning it to the floor.

                             KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                   Alright boys, you ready? A true
                   test.

      He steels his eyes on KABLE and concentrates.

      KABLE slowly brings up the KNIFE toward DELIA'S THROAT.

      ANGIE moves to pull DELIA away - CASTLE merely glances up at            *
      her and she FREEZES, paralyzed. We can see her body strain              *
      against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...                     *

                               KABLE
                         (desperate)
                   No.

                             KEN CASTLE
                   Just like last time. Remember?

      KABLE is FIGHTING IT with all his will, his whole body
      shaking...

                  You're stronger now... a little
                  more fight in you... but I think
                  the end result will be about the
                  same...                                                       *

                  Shh.

      The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... He              *
      looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he                  *
      seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS                   *
      EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARDS.               *

      Suddenly:

      KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in one
      quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the
      floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a
      hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up into
      his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short...

      Not even KABLE understands this.

      SIMON is on his feet, in full BADASS GAMER MODE.

      His body is positioned exactly like KABLE'S - right hand
      gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust; left hand
      clutching CASTLE'S THROAT... he FORCES HIS RIGHT HAND
      FORWARD...

163   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - CONTINUOUS                                 163

      ... KABLE'S KNIFE HAND begins to inch forward. Now CASTLE is
      the one struggling for control; he claws weakly at KABLE'S
      hand, trying to loosen it off his neck...

                          KEN CASTLE
                    (panicking)
                JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN
                RETARDS!

                          GEEK
                    (irritated)
                Working on it...

      KABLE'S eyes are locked in on CASTLE'S... straining with
      everything he has... his strength and will overpowering
      CASTLE, but-

                          KEN CASTLE
                    (like he's explaining the
                     obvious to a child)
                I think it.

      KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the
      knife away from CASTLE'S belly.

                          KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
                You... fucking... do it...

      CASTLE delivers a CRUNCHING HEADBUTT to his NOSE, KABLE loses
      his footing, sweat pouring down his face, bloody, drained...
      CASTLE pushes the KNIFE back towards KABLE. He fights back -
      every muscle in his arm fighting against another like Yin &
      Yang, veins rising in his neck...

      Then KABLE senses an opportunity:

                          KABLE
                Look at this knife... imagine me
                sticking it into your gut... think
                about it... make it real.

      CASTLE laughs... BUT HIS EYES FLICKER TO THE KNIFE - of
      course he can't help but picture it...

      ... and in that instant KABLE JAMS IN THE BLADE...

      ... CASTLE focuses, trying to pull it back out, but KABLE
      shoves it in deeper - CASTLE'S EYES BULGE. Finally KABLE
      TWISTS the KNIFE and lifts CASTLE OFF THE GROUND.

      The paralysis breaks from ANGIE - she lunges forward to throw           *
      her arms around her daughter.                                           *

                       (triumphant)

      He drops down into the badass, ROCKSTAR pose...

165   INT. CASTLE'S COURT - SIMULTANEOUS                                165

      ... and KABLE does the same.                                            *

                             KABLE
                   Damn it, kid...

      CASTLE collapses to his knees in front of KABLE, glass-eyed,
      draining life... they are FACE to FACE.

                              KABLE (cont'd)
                   ... is the fuckin pose really
                   necessary?

      CASTLE face-plants on the COURT.

                               SIMON
                   Sorry.

      KABLE'S body relaxes; he tosses the knife across the floor...
      then turns to face his family.

      When DELIA finally speaks there is a trace of CASTLE'S
      Georgia peach accent.

                             DELIA
                   Are you my Daddy Tillman?

      He gathers DELIA in his arms and lifts her off her feet,
      squeezing her close; she SQUEEZES BACK. KABLE grabs ANGIE
      with his other arm and pulls her in.

      The GEEKS look at one another - realize that their employment
      contract with CASTLE has just been terminated... shrug;
      pocket their shit, zip up their backpacks and fanny packs,
      get up and start to file out.

                               KABLE
                   Wait.

      He nods to PONYTAIL GEEK: do it.

      The GEEK LEADER betrays a ghost of a smile.

                             GEEK LEADER (cont'd)
                   Well played, Kable.

      KABLE doesn't answer; but his eyes say: how was any of this a
      fucking game?

      SHOOTING STARS fly past us in the dark... the SAME IMAGE WE
      STARTED WITH... only instead of an underground train carrying
      SOLDIERS to battle...

      The TUNNEL ENDS; we break from the side of a mountain into
      BLUE SKY AND SUNLIGHT.

      KABLE is driving on the open highway... ANGIE is in the
      passenger seat, asleep, head pressed up against the window
      glass.

      KABLE checks the rear view window; makes eye contact with
      DELIA, who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back
      seat.

                             KABLE
                   You good, sweetheart?

      DELIA nods.

      KABLE allows himself a smile, puts his eyes back on the road.
      ANGIE slowly reaches for KABLE'S hand, she rubs her thumb on
      his tattoo - "I am right here with you" - and falls back
      asleep.

      The CAMERA tilts up, stares out the front window and moves
      into the giant sun.

     FADE IN

     A white title appears on a black screen.

              "As night-fall does not come at once, neither
              does oppression...It is in such twilight that
              we all must be aware of change in the air
              - however slight - lest we become victims of
              the darkness."
                            Justice William O. Douglas


     The title fades off, replaced by a second title.

              "I not only think that we will tamper with
              Mother Nature, I think Mother wants us to."

                                William Gaylin

     The second title fades off, leaving a dark screen.

     The darkness gradually gives way to a dawning light.

     We are confronted with sight of a barren, empty landscape.  A
     wide expanse of wasteland.

     Suddenly, without warning, an elephant tusk falls from the sky
     and crashes onto the parched ground.  The earth-shuddering
     impact causes the tusk to rebound once in slow motion before
     finally settling to the desert floor in a cloud of dust.

     The first tusk is quickly followed by a second, also dropping
     from the heavens.  It lands near the first.  Another tusk
     smashes to earth several yards away.  Yet another comes crashing
     into the foreground.

     Finally the dust settles upon a graveyard of tusks.

     DISSOLVE TO


     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE

     In another region of the wasteland, a forest of tree trunks
     suddenly rains down from the sky.  The trunks thump to the hard
     ground, also rebounding in slow motion.  Cleanly sawn,
     branchless, palm-like trunks, they come to rest in the dust only
     to be followed by a second cascade of lumber.

     When the dust finally clears. the felled tree trunks lie in a
     huge, log-jam in the desert.

     DISSOLVE TO


     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE

     Next to descend from the sky, a torrent of firewood.  One shower
     after another, crashing to the plain.  Enough chopped lumber to
     fuel a thousand hearths.

     DISSOLVE TO


     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE

     Joining the rest of the debris is a deluge of slate - sheets
     of shale from a great unseen quarry in the sky come slamming to
     earth.  Some of the pieces shattering, some rebounding into the
     air until the granite litters acres of landscape as far as the
     eye can see.

     TITLES ARE SPACED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE PRECEDING
     SEQUENCE.  THE FINAL TITLE READS:

        T H E   N O T  -  T O O  -  D I S T A N T   F U T U R E

     The camera commences a long, slow pull-back from the pile of
     elephant tusks.  Gradually they are revealed as human
     fingernails magnified many hundreds of times.

     The tree trunks are mere hair follicles.  The firewood,
     whiskers.  The slate, flakes of skin.


     INT.  INCINERATOR.  EARLY MORNING.

     A naked MAN, thirties, seen in profile, is crouched upon a metal
     floor inside a small, brushed stainless steel tank, rubbing his
     skin raw with a wire brush.  JEROME MORROW.

     Having completed his scrupulous ablutions, Jerome arches his
     lean frame through the small, oval door of the metal room
     with practised ease.

     Securing the thick, fireproof windowed door behind himself, he
     turns a switch to release gas into the vacated chamber.  The gas
     instantly ignites in what is now revealed to be a gleaming
     modern stainless-steel custom-made incinerator.

     We refocus on a MAGNIFIED CLOSE UP of his exfoliated flesh in
     the incinerator as it blackens, curls and burns.

     Jerone covers himself with a silk robe and steps into a pair of
     backless slippers.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.

     JEROME emerges from the incinerator room into a large, luxurious
     loft-style condo containing a bizarre assortment of equipment -
     arranged somewhat like a production line.

     Long, scrupulously clean metal work benches are arranged along
     one entire wall.  Laid out on the benches in neat rows are
     dozens of plastic bags - some filled, some unfilled.  Instruments
     on trays - various types of tweezers, scissors and other less
     familiar utensils.  Round, stainless steel containers filled
     with hairs of differing lengths and other body matter.

     JEROME approaches another man slumped over one of the benches.
     EUGENE.  He clutches an empty vodka bottle.  He is snoring
     lightly - sleeping off the night before.  As JEROME gently
     prises the bottle out of his hand, we are struck by the
     similarity of Eugene's face to Jerome's.

     Jerome pulls Eugene's chair back from the desk with surprising
     ease.  A wheelchair - a modern, ergonomic design.  Jerome wheels
     Eugene to a bedroom and, with some difficulty, hauls the larger
     man onto the bed.  Through his alcoholic fog, Eugene feebly co-
     operates - his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight.

     After covering Eugene with a blanket, Jerome enters a bathroom
     containing a surgically-clean stainless steel basin, sink,
     shower and toilet.

     Beside the toilet stands a large, industrial-style stainless
     steel refrigerator.

     Donning protective gloves, Jerome opens the liquid-nitrogen
     cooled refrigerator.  A cloud of condensed water vapor billows
     out.  Revealed inside the fridge are racks of labelled jars and
     silicon pouches - some containing a yellowish liquid, some a
     deep, red liquid.

     In front of one of the jars is a handwritten shopping list -
     "TRUFFLES, CIGS, VODKA".  Jerome smiles to himself as he
     retrieves the note along with one of the jars.  He checks the
     jar's label.  Satisfied with the date written there, he breaks
     the seal and pours the contents into the clear, silicon pouch of
     an IV-like device lying on the steel bathroom counter.

     He seals the pouch and checks the apparatus by opening the valve
     on its fine tube and squirting a small quantity of the liquid
     into the nearby toilet bowl, as one would test a syringe.  We
     remain on Jerome's face as he reaches between his legs and
     inserts the pouch.

     Reopening the refrigerator, Jerome slides out a tray containing
     neat rows of slim, fingertip-sized plastic sachets filled with a
     deep, red-colored liquid.  He removes his gloves, selects one of
     the sachets and carefully adheres the sachet to the pad at the
     end of his index finger.  He prepares a second sachet for his
     middle finger.  Jerome then applies skin-colored cover-up makeup
     to the sachets, blending them in with the color of his fingers.
     JEROME, still dressed in his robe, climbs a large, spiral
     staircase to the floor above.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.

     He emerges at the top of the staircase into a similarly large,
     loft-stlye condominium.  Through the floor to ceiling window
     that opens onto a balcony we see that dawn is only just starting
     to leak into the night sky.

     In the bedroom JEROME removes a shirt from a drycleaning bag.
     Printed on the bag - "Confidentiality Guaranteed".  He emerges
     from his bedroom, dressed in a smart albeit unconventionally cut
     suit.  He adjusts his tie in the mirror, careful not to disturb
     the sachets attached to his fingertips.


     INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S POOL.  MORNING.

     A lone MAN swims a ferocious lap of freestyle in what appears to
     be a pool of enormous length - yet he never reaches the pool's
     end.  We pull wider to reveal that the man is swimming against
     an artificial current in a pool barely larger than himself.

     Abruptly, the man stops and stands up - the fast-flowing current
     instantly stilled.  We glimpse the face of INVESTIGATOR LUCAS.
     Thirties, he has a youthful yet rigid face.  We have the
     impression that he does not swim for pleasure.


     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  MORNING.

     It is still early as JEROME exits the building's underground
     parking garage in an immaculate Studebaker Avanti and proceeds
     down the long straight driveway.  He exchanges a wave with a
     GARDENER trimming a lawn.

     The whir of the car's electric powered engine belies its
     conventional appearance.


     EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.

     JEROME's car exits a highway and turns up the sweeping road
     leading to the parking lot of "GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION".
     A sleek, modern, low-rise industrial compound boasting perfectly
     manicured landscaped gardens.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.

     JEROME strides purposefully up to the entranceway with hundreds
     of other GATTACA EMPLOYEES.  He carries himself with a certain
     arrogance, a cool detachment.  All employees wear similarly
     unconventionally-cut suits, short coiffed hair and robust tans.
     The Gattaca employees are a seemingly equal split of men and
     women and a diverse range of ethnicities.

     They filter through a row of channels supervised by SECURITY
     GUARDS.  Each channel contains a computerized security device,
     featuring a slim groove in which the employee places a finger
     under the watchful eye of a Security Guard.

     Jerome gives a polite nod to a Guard as he places his index
     finger in the groove.  His fingertip is jabbed with the
     finest of needles and a minute blood sample taken.

     The blood specimen confirms Jerome's identity - an ID photograph
     appearing on a computer screen.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Jerome spies a young woman
     entering through the adjacent channel.  She is also sneaking a
     glance in his direction - IRENE.  Catching each other looking,
     they both quickly avert their eyes.

     As Jerome enters the computer facility of Gattaca Aerospace
     Corporation he furtively glances at the pin-prick puncture in
     his fingertip sachet.


     SOMEWHERE IN DEEP SPACE.

     A GATTACA spacecraft skirts an asteroid.  Taking advantage of
     the rock's gravitational pull, the craft slingshots deeper into
     the black void.  Then abruptly the craft and the asteroid freeze
     in mid-space, suddenly reverse direction and proceed forward
     again - the spacecraft taking a slightly adjusted course.

     We pull back to reveal that the journey is merely a highly
     realistic graphic representation on a GATTACA computer screen
     operated by JEROME.

     Appearing simultaneously alongside the computer animation is a
     seemingly never-ending column of computer instructions for this
     celestial navigation - the incomprehensible language of the
     computer programmer.

              140 #x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20{
              150 #x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00
              160 #xfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfe

     Jerome is transported - plotting a path through the heavens.
     As his fingers fly across the keys he does not once take his
     eyes from the screen.

     His is one of hundreds of ergonomically designed work stations,
     arranged in ever-widening circles in a huge, curcular, well-
     appointed if antiseptic room.  Each curved desk contains a
     computer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim,
     transparent screen behind which is seated a PROGRAMMER,
     designing software for the aerospace agency.  At the center of
     the room is a donut-shaped command console, chairs facing
     outwards, from which operations are monitored.

     Floor to ceiling smoked-glass curved walls offer the only
     concession to nature - a tinted view of a man-made, meticulously
     landscaped garden.

     Jerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a
     discreet mini-vac.  He vacuums between the keys of his keyboard.
     DIRECTOR JOSEF, 50's, a shorter, official-looking man
     approaches.  His assistant IRENE stands at his shoulder.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              You keep your work station so clean, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              --Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?

     The Director smiles at the notion and places a computer disc
     on Jerome's desk.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              I reviewed your flight plan.  Not one error
              in a hundred thousand keystrokes.  Phenomenal.
                      (placing a hand on Jerome's shoulder)
              It's right that someone like you is taking us
              to the Belt.
                      (glancing to notification on Jerome's screen)
              You have a substance test.

     The Director briskly departs, Irene in tow.  At a nearby work
     station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at
     the mention of the test.

     Jerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his
     ankle.  However he surreptitiously produced one of Eugene's
     transparent specimen bags from his sock.  An EXTREME CLOSE UP
     reveals the bag's contents - flakes of skin, hair follicles,
     eyelashes, a fingernail.  Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid
     detection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his
     keyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station.

     He opens his desk drawer and casually scatters the remainder of
     the bag.  Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two
     hair follicles.

     Jerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the
     testing lab.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - TESTING LABORATORY.  DAY.

     White-coated LAMAR, forties, buzzcut, a man's man, checks
     JEROME's eyes with an instrument.  Satisfied with his
     examination, he passes a transparent plastic container to
     JEROME.  Standing directly in front of the technician with his
     back to camera, Jerome opens his fly.  A steady stream of urine
     begins to flow into the container from Jerome's hidden pouch.

                           LAMAR
                      (staring admiringly at the discharge)
              Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command.
              You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told
              you that, Jerome?

                           JEROME
                      (deadpan as he continues to urinate)
              Only every time I'm in here.

     Jerome hands the container to Lamara who seals and label it as
     Jerome refastens his trousers.

                           LAMAR
              I see a lot of cocks.  I speak from experience.
              Yours is a beautiful example.  Why didn't my
              folks order a cock like that for me?

     LAMAR pours the urine sample into a high-tech device where it
     is instantly analyzed.  The urine identifies Jerone while also
     registering a negative drug reading.  The computer reads
     "VALID".

                           LAMAR
                      (walking Jerome to the door)
              If everything goes to plan, this could be the
              last time I see you for a while.  One week to
              go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.

                           JEROME
              I'll tell you at the end of the week.

     Jerome departs.


     INT.  GATTACA - RESTROOM.  DAY.

     JEROME enters the restroom and glances at the toilet stalls.
     Only three in the bank of twenty is occupied.  He tarries at the
     mirror above the uniform line of basins, unnecessarily
     reknotting his tie.

     A toilet flushes and a COLLEAGUE exits one of the stalls.  He
     and Jerome exchange a nod.  When the man has exited the restroom,
     Jerome enters the man's vacated stall.


     INT.  GATTACA - TOILET STALL.  DAY.

     JEROME immediately feels around the back of the toilet bowl and
     detaches a secreted stainless steel container.

     With surprising swiftness and dexterity, Jerome removes an
     extremely fine contact lens from each eye and drops the pair
     into the toilet bowl.  He inserts two replacement lenses from
     the container and reattaches it in its hiding place.
     Jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall.  He checks in the
     mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted.


     INT.  GATTACA - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

     Walking back along one of the long, glass-walled corridors,
     JEROME becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex -
     or to be more precise, a lack of noise.  The incessant tapping
     of computer keys has stilled.

     As Jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor, we see the
     reflection of his face, deep in thought.

                           JEROME (VO)
              The most unremarkable of events.  Jerome
              Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days
              away from a one-year manned mission to 951
              Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt.  Nothing so
              unique in that.  Last year over one thousand
              citizens from every walk of life embarked on
              some space mission or other.  Besides,
              selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed
              at birth.  He is blessed with all the physical
              and intellectual gifts required for such an
              arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second
              to none.

     Jerome's gaze drifts to the sky.

                           JEROME (VO)
              No, there is truly nothing remarkable about
              the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I
              am not Jerome Morrow.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DUSK - THIRTY-ODD YEARS EARILER

     A starry sky.  The camera tilts down to find palm trees
     swaying against a setting sun.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I was conceived in the Riviera.  Not the
              French Riviera.

     The camera tilts down further to find a Buick Riviera parked in
     a deserted beachfront parking lot on a polluted stretch of
     beach.

                           JEROME (VO)
              The Detroit variety.

     Through the car's steamed windows we see Jerome's mother and
     father, MARIA and ANTONIO, early twenties, making love.

                           JEROME (VO)
              They used to say that a child conceived in love,
              has a greater chance of happiness.  They don't
              say that any more.


     INT.  FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC.  DAY.

     MARIA, wearing a medical gown, lies on an examining table, feet
     in stirrups.  A NURSE, forties, wheels an instrument tray
     towards her.  Maria suddenly disengages her feet from the
     stirrups and swings her legs off the table.

                           NURSE
              What are you doing?

                           MARIA
                      (shaking her head)
              I can't do this.

                           NURSE
                      (misinterpreting the problem)
              I told you, the government pays.  It's all
              taken care of.

                           MARIA
              No, you don't understand.  I can't.

     The nurse places a comforting hand on Maria's shoulder.

                           NURSE
                      (reassuring)
              The doctor will give you something.

                           MARIA
                      (removing the hand, adamant)
              I'm not doing it.

                           NURSE
                      (trying to make her see reason)
              Honey, you've made one mistake--

     The remark stings Maria.

                           NURSE
                      (softening her tone)
              --I've read your profile.  I don't
              know about the father but you carry
              enough hereditary factors on your own.
                      (pause)
              You can have other children.

                           MARIA
                      (holding her swollen stomach protectively)
              Not like this one.

                           NURSE
                      (trying to be diplomatic)
              Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't
              want one like that one.

     Maria gets off the table and reaches for her clothes laying
     across a chair.

                           MARIA
                      (irate)
              You don't know what it will be!

     The nurse watches Maria as she dresses, genuinely bewildered.

                           NURSE
                      (calling out to Maria as she disappears
                      out of the door)
              The child won't thank you!


     INT.  DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY.

     We focus on a crucifix dangling on a rosary.  Tilting up we find
     the rosary clasped between MARIA and ANTONIO's intertwined
     hands.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Those were early days--days when a priest
              could still persuade someone to put their
              faith in God's hands rather than those of
              the local geneticist.

     Bathed in sweat, Maria gives a final push on the delivery table.

     While still attached to his umbilical cord, the heel of the
     NEWBORN BABY BOY is immediately pricked by a masked NURSE.  A
     minute drop of blood is inserted into an analyzing machine.

     Even as the baby is put into Maria's arms, page after page of
     data begins to appear on a monitor, pulsing warning signals
     throughout the spreadsheets.

     Two assisting NURSES exchange a look.  Antonio senses something
     amiss.

                           ANTONIO
              What's wrong?

                           JEROME (VO)
              Of course, there was nothing wrong with me.
              Not so long ago I would have been considered
              a perfectly healthy, normal baby.  Ten fingers,
              ten toes.  That was all that used to matter.
              But now my immediate well-being was not the
              sole concern.

     Antonio turns his attention from his baby to the data appearing
     on the monitor.  We see individual items highlighted amongst the
     data - "NERVE CONDITION - PROBABILITY 60%", "MANIC DEPRESSION -
 42%", "OBESITY - 66%", "ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER - 89%"-- 
 JEROME (VO)               My destiny was mapped out before me--
              all my flaws, predispositions and
              susceptibilities - most untreatable to
              this day.  Only minutes old, the date and
              cause of my death was already known.

     Antonio focuses on a final highlighted item on the monitor's
     screen, "HEART DISORDER - 99% - EARLY FATAL POTENTIAL.".
     "LIFE EXPECTANCY - 33 YEARS".

                           NURSE
              The name?
                      (typing details into birth certificate)
              For the certificate.

                           MARIA
              Antonio--

                           ANTONIO
                      (correcting her)
              --No, Vincent Antonio.

     With a computer stylus he signs the nurse's handheld screen.


     EXT.  TRACT HOME - BACKYARD.  DAY.

     2-YEAR-OLD JEROME (REFERRED TO BY HIS GIVEN NAME OF "VINCENT"
     FOR MOST OF THE FOLLOWING FLASHBACK) running with a toy rocket
     falls more in clumsiness than fatigue.  MARIA suddenly whisks up
     the toddler.

                           MARIA
                      (hysterical)
              Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let
              you out of my sight.

     Maria frantically listens to her young son's heartbeat.  For
     his part, Vincent appears surprised by the attention.  Maria
     places a portable oxygen mask over Vincent's mouth.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I was born Vincent Antonio Luca.  And from
              an early age I came to think of myself as
              others thought of me - chronically ill.
              Every skinned knee and runny nose treated
              as if it were life-threatening.


     INT.  DAY CARE CENTER.  DAY.

     MARIA and ANTONIO drop off dark-haired 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT at a
     Day Care Center.

                           JEROME (VO)
              And my parents soon realized that wherever
              I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me.

     While HEALTHY CHILDREN play outside on tricycles, clamber over
     jungle-gyms and finger-paint, the PRE-SCHOOL TEACHER shows
     Vincent into a room where CHILDREN WITH OBVIOUS DISABILITIES
     sleep on mats.

     Maria wheels around and marches out of the center with Vincent
     in her arms.  Antonio follows close behind, pleading with his
     wife to see sense.

                           JEROME (VO)
              They put off having any more children
              until they could afford not to gamble -
              to bring a child into the world in what
              has become the "natural" way.


     EXT.  HOME.  DAY.

     ANTONIO reluctantly shows off his spotless Buick Riviera to a
     prospective BUYER.

                           JEROME (VO)
              It meant selling the beloved Buick.

     The two men haggle over the price while MARIA, holding VINCENT
     in her arms, looks on.  Finally money and a pink slip are
     exchanged.

                           VINCENT (VO)
              My father got a good price.  After all,
              the only accident he'd ever had in that
              car was me.

     As the BUYER drives away, Antonio shrugs to Maria to hide his
     disappointment.


     EXT.  GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE BUILDING.  DAY.

     ANTONIO, MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT exit a packed commuter
     bus and enter a Genetic Counselling office building bearing
     the sign - "PRO-CREATION".


     INT.  GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE.  DAY.

     A GENETICIST stares into a high-powered microscope as ANTONIO,
     MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT are shown into the office by a
     NURSE.  On the counter beside the Geneticist is a glass-doored
     industrial refrigerator containing petri dishes arranged on
     racks several feet high.

                           GENETICIST
                      (to the nurse, without taking
                       his eyes from his binocular microscope)
              Put up the dish.

     While Antonio and Maria take a seat in front of a television
     monitor, the Nurse puts a labelled petri dish under a video-
     equipped microscope.  The Geneticist swings around in his chair
     to greet his clients.

     Four magnified clusters of cells - eight cells on each cluster
     - appear on the television screen.

                           GENETICIST
              Your extracted eggs...
                      (noting the couple's names from
                      data along the edge of the screen)
              ...Maria, have been fertilized with...
              Antonio's sperm and we have performed an
              analysis of the resulting pre-embryos.
              After screening we're left with two healthy
              boys and two healthy girls.  Naturally, no
              critical pre-dispositions to any of the major
              inheritable diseases.  All that remains is
              to select the most compatible candidate.

     Maria and Antonio exchange a nervous smile.

                           GENETICIST
              First, we may as well decide on gender.
              Have you given it any thought?

                           MARIA
                      (referring to the toddler
                      on her knee)
              We would like Vincent to have a brother...
              you know, to play with.

     The Geneticist nods.  He scans the data around the edge of the
     screen.

                           GENETICIST
              You've already specified blue eyes, dark
              hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty
              of eradicating any potentially prejudicial
              conditions - premature baldness, myopia,
              alcoholism and addictive susceptibility,
              propensity for violence and obesity--

                           MARIA
                      (interrupting, anxious)
              --We didn't want--diseases, yes.

                           ANTONIO
                      (more diplomatic)
              We were wondering if we should leave some
              things to chance.

                           GENETICIST
                      (reassuring)
              You want to give your child the best possible
              start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection
              built-in already.  Your child doesn't need
              any additional burdens.  And keep in mind,
              this child is still you, simply the best of you.
              You could conceive naturally a thousand times
              and never get such a result.

                           ANTONIO
                      (squeezing Maria's hand)
              He's right, Maria.  That's right.

     Maria is only half-convinced, but the Geneticist swiftly moves
     on.

                           GENETICIST
              Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed
              child?

                           ANTONIO
                      (blank)
              Er, no...

                           GENETICIST
                      (explaining)
              Some believe it is associated with creativity,
              although there's no evidence.  Also for
              sports like baseball it can be an advantage.

                           ANTONIO
                      (shrugs)
              I like football.

                           GENETICIST
                      (injecting a note of levity)
              I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going
              to be at least a head taller than you.
              Prepare for a crick in the neck in
              sixteen years time.

     Antonio beams proudly.

                           GENETICIST
                      (scanning the data on the screen)
              Anything I've forgotten?

                           MARIA
                      (hesitant about broaching the subject)
              We want him--we were hoping he would get
              married and have children.  We'd like
              grandchildren.

                           GENETICIST
                      (conspiratorial smile)
              I understand.  That's already been taken
              care of.
                      (an afterthought)
              Now you appreciate I can only work with
              the raw material I have at my disposal but
              for a little extra...I could also attempt to
              insert sequences associated with enhanced
              mathematical or musical ability.

                           MARIA
                      (suddenly enthused)
              Antonio, the choir...

                           GENETICIST
                      (interjecting, covering himself)
              I have to caution you it's not fool-proof.
              With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.

                           ANTONIO
              How much extra?

                           GENETICIST
              It would be five thousand more.

     Antonio's face falls.

                           ANTONIO
              I'm sorry, there's no way we can.

                           GENETICIST
              Don't worry.  You'll probably do just
              as well singing to him in the womb.
                      (rising to end the appointment)
              We can implant the most successful
              pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.

     Maria is staring at the four magnified clumps on the screen.

                           MARIA
              What will happen to the others?

                           GENETICIST
                      (reassuring)
              They are not babies, Maria, merely
              "human possibilities".

     Removing the petri dish from beneath the lens of the microscope,
     he points out the four minuscule specks.

                           GENETICIST
              Smaller than a grain of sand.

     DISSOLVE TO


     INT.  TRACT HOME.  DAY.

     A red pencil draws a mark on a doorway at the height of a
     child's head.  The child moves away and the name, "ANTON 11" is
     written beside the mark by proud father, ANTONIO.

                           JEROME (VO)
              That's how my brother, Anton, came into the
              world - a son my father considered worthy
              of his name.

     There is little physical similarity between 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON
     and 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT standing beside him, apart from their
     height.  In fact Vincent is mortified to see that his younger
     brother's mark is a fraction of an inch higher than the mark
     beside his own name, "VINCENT 13".  Vincent runs from the room.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DAY.

     13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT and 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON sit together on a
     windswept beach.

     Anton picks up a broken shell and deliberately slices the tip of
     his thumb with the sharp edge.  He hands the shell to Vincent
     who hesitantly follows suit.

                           JEROME (VO)
              By the time we were playing at blood
              brothers I understood that there was something
              very different flowing through my veins.

     The two brothers press their thumbs together, merging the blood.

                           JEROME (VO)
              And I'd need an awful lot more than
              a drop if I was going to get anywhere.


     EXT.  BEACH.  LATER IN THE DAY.

     While ANTONIO and MARIA doze under a beach umbrella, ANTON and
     VINCENT enter the water, diving through the waves.  From above
     we watch their two young bodies swimming beside each other
     beyond the breakers.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Our favorite game was "chicken".  When our
              parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside
              the flags, as far out as we dared.  It was about
              who would get scared and turn back first.

     Suddenly VINCENT stops swimming, pulling up sharply in the
     water, exhausted and fearful.  He watches ANTON swim on into the
     distance.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Of course, it was always me.  Anton was by far
              the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.


     INT.  SCHOOL - CLASSROOM.  DAY.

     A TEACHER gives a physics lesson.  The bespectacled 13-YEAR-OLD
     VINCENT has his arm energetically raised at each opportunity but
     is never called upon.  Eventually he lowers his arm in defeat.

                           JEROME (VO)
              My genetic scarlet letter continued to follow
              me from school to school.  When you're told
              you're prone to learning disabilities, it's
              sometimes easier not to disappoint anybody.


     EXT.  STREET.  NIGHT.

     13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT stands at a cul-de-sac at the end of a long,
     straight deserted street.  He places a basketball in the middle
     of the street to represent the SUN and begins to unwind the huge
     reel of string attached to the ball.  11-YEAR-OLD ANTON walks a
     pace behind him.  Several yards along the trail a bead is
     threaded through the string to represent the planet MERCURY.

                           ANTON
              How many astronauts are there, anyway?

     Vincent ignores him and continues to reel out the string.

                           ANTON
              I bet I could be one.

     Vincent stops and regards his younger brother with contempt.

                           VINCENT
              You're standing on Venus.

     Anton lifts his foot.  There is a bead beneath it.


     INT/EXT.  CAR / SATELLITE DISH.  DUSK.

     VINCENT has developed into a handsome 17-YEAR-OLD.  His
     spectacles hidden, he and a YOUNG WOMAN are necking in the front
     seat of a beat-up car, parked overlooking a huge satellite dish.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I was popular enough until it got around
              that I wasn't a long-term proposition.

     The love-making intensifies.  The YOUNG WOMAN moves down
     Vincent's chest and unzips his fly.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Those who didn't know already could easily
              find out for themselves.  It was certainly
              no problem coaxing the information out of me.

     We remain on Vincent's face as he climaxes.  The YOUNG WOMAN
     turns her head away from the spent Jerome and, out of his
     view, trickles semen from her mouth into a clear specimen vial.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I didn't blame them.  You need to know if a
              prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage
              or life insurance or can hold down a decent job.


     INT.  HOME.  DAY.

     In the living room of their modest home, the dark-haired, 17-
     year-old, bespectacled VINCENT sits opposite his PARENTS.  The
     crestfallen Vincent has a book on his lap entitled "CAREERS IN
     SPACE".

                           MOTHER
                      (trying to break it gently)
              Vincent, you have to be realistic.  A
              heart condition like yours--

                           VINCENT
              --I don't care.  I'll take the risk.

                           MOTHER
              It's not just you they have to be concerned
              about.  Perhaps we could get you one of
              those new pacemakers.  They're not perfect
              but--

                           FATHER
                      (letting his frustration show)
              For God's sake, Vincent, don't you understand.
              The only way you'll see the inside of a space
              ship is if you're cleaning it!

     Vincent looks at his father in disbelief.

     On a dinner table on the other side of the living room, 15-YEAR-
     OLD ANTON looks up from the biological specimen he is studying
     with a magnifying glass.


     INT.  PERSONNEL OFFICE - WAITING ROOM.  DAY.

     17-YEAR-OLD VINCENT hides his glasses in his pocket as he enters
     a WAITING ROOM.  He gazes around at other APPLICANTS.

                           JEROME (VO)
              My father was right.  It didn't matter how
              much I lied on my resumÈ, my real C.V. was
              in my cells.  Why should anybody invest all
              that money to train me, when there are a
              thousand other applicants with a far cleaner
              profile?  Of course, it's illegal to discriminate -
              "genoism" it's called - but no one takes the
              laws seriously.

     As Jerome enters the office, we focus on the doorhandle he has
     just touched.

                           JEROME (VO)
              If you refuse to disclose, they can always
              take a sample from a doorhandle...

     Vincent hesitates before shaking the PERSONNEL OFFICER's
     outstretched hand.

                           JEROME (VO)
              ...or a handshake...

     We focus on Jerome's envelope attached to his application form
     sitting on the Manager's desk.

                           JEROME (VO)
              ...even the saliva off your application form.

     Sitting opposite the manager, Jerome's face falls.  The manager
     puts a clear, plastic cup in front of Jerome.

                           JEROME (VO)
              But for the most part we know who we are.
              And if all else fails, a legal drug test
              can just as easily become an illegal peek
              at your future in the company.

     Vincent saves the Manager the trouble and exits the office,
     leaving the cup where it sits.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DAY.

     17-YEAR-OLD JEROME walks up the beach to find 15-YEAR-OLD ANTON
     sitting with the YOUNG WOMAN Vincent had previously dated.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I didn't blame Anton for his free ride.  You
              can't blame someone for winning the lottery.

     The Young Woman hastily departs.

     LATER the two brothers face each other on the sand.  Anton is
     the more statuesque of the two.

                           ANTON
                      (cocky)
              You sure you want to do this?

     Vincent's answer is to walk towards the water.  Anton smiles
     mockingly at his brother's grim "game face" and
     follows.

     From an aerial view we watch VINCENT and his younger brother, ANTON,
     swim beyond the breakers.

                           JEROME (VO)
              It was the last time we swam together.
              Out into the open sea, like always,
              knowing each stroke towards the horizon
              was one we had to make back to the
              shore.  Like always, the unspoken contest.

     We watch the two young men swimming stroke for stroke.  They
     swim far out, beyond the point.  Suddenly ANTON starts to slow,
     his strokes becoming labored until he becomes motionless in the
     water.  He begins to sink like a stone.  VINCENT, realizing
     Anton is no longer beside him, turns back to lend support.
     Vincent takes him in a lifeguard hold and begins to nurse him
     back to shore.  Finally the two boys are coughed up onto the
     shallows.  They collapse, just beyond the waterline, exhausted,
     gasping for air.  ANTONIO and MARIA arrive on the scene.  ANTON
     is the first to recover while VINCENT clutches his side, his
     face screwed up in pain.  Maria kneels down and starts to
     administer to Vincent but his father, Antonio, is unable to
     conceal his anger and contempt for Vincent.

                           ANTONIO
              Vincent, you damn fool!  You could have killed
              Anton with your ridiculous contest!  Why should
              he risk his life to save yours?!  When are you
              going to get it through your thick head--you
              can't compete with your brother!  Why try?!

     Maria takes Antonio aside.  Anton and Vincent exchange a look.

                           ANTON
              Why didn't you say anything?

                           VINCENT
              Why didn't you?
                        (staring back at his father knowingly)
              It's okay.  It's the way they want it.

                           JEROME (VO)
              It confirmed everything in the minds of
              my parents - that they had taken the right
              course with my younger brother and the
              wrong course with me.  It would have been so
              much easier for everyone if I had slipped away
              that day.  I decided to grant them that wish.


     INT.  HOME.  NIGHT.

     ANTON stands at the mantlepiece in the dimly-lit living room.
     He gazes at a framed family portrait - Vincent's face has been
     torn out of it.  He suddenly spies VINCENT exiting the front
     gate, carrying a suitcase.  Anton goes to shout Vincent's name
     but the words don't get out.


     EXT.  GATTACA.  DAWN.

     A pick-up truck, packed with a CLEANING CREW, pulls into the
     rear of the building.  They are no longer strictly the migrant
     workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of
     ethnicities - all members of a genetic underclass that does not
     discriminate by race.

     As VINCENT exits the truck and turns towards the camera, we
     discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to
     know as JEROME.  The only visible differences are the glasses he
     wears and his hair, still naturally dark.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Like many others in my situation, I moved
              around a lot in the next few years, getting
              work where I could.  I must have cleaned
              half the toilets in the state.

     We follow VINCENT through the course of a day.  Cleaning
     restrooms, toilets, picking up litter, sweeping, washing
     windows - gazing at the AEROSPACE WORKERS below.  The building
     is part of the Gattaca facility, located near a shuttle launch
     site.  Throughout the day, with the regularity of 747's, Vincent
     spies rocket ships in the distance, launching into the sky.
     Jerome's is the only head that turns and looks up.  Long after
     the sun has set, Vincent is still working.  Another rocket ship
     lights up the darkness.  Vincent gazes forlornly into the
     heavens.


     EXT. GATTACA - GLASS WALL.  DAY.

     VINCENT cleans a window from the outside, staring in at the
     arrogant GATTACA EMPLOYEES entering the security channels -
     a smaple taken from their fingertips.  Jerome, in a trance,
     constantly cleans the same spot of glass.  He fails to notice an
     Older Janitor, CAESAR, appear beside him.

                           CAESAR
              When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't
              clean it too well.

                           VINCENT
                      (confused)
              What do you mean?

                           CAESAR
                      (glancing to the Gattaca workers)
              You might get ideas.

                           VINCENT
              But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier
              for you to see me when I'm on the other
              side of it.

     Caesar smiles at Vincent's cockiness.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     VINCENT empties garbage into a dumpster adjacent to Gattaca.
     His attention is drawn to something in the trash.  A discarded
     manual on Celestial Mechanics and Navigation.  He wipes food
     residue off the corner.


     INT.  ASTRONOMY & TELESCOPE SHOP.  DAY.

     A forest of telescopes on tripods in an astronomy shop.  VINCENT
     enters the store with a bucket and squeegee and immediately goes
     to clean the storefront window.  The STORE OWNER looks up from
     his tabloid - "STAR" magazine.

                           OWNER
              Where's Earl?

                           JEROME
              He fell.  Lucky it was only the second floor.

     The owner nods and returns to his magazine.  When he looks up
     again one of his tripods is missing its telescope and Jerome is
     nowhere to be seen.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME returns to his bare apartment.  He removes the cloth
     covering the bucket to reveal a dumpy-shaped telescope snugly
     wedged inside.  He starts to pour over his collection of
     textbooks.  Other tattered space paraphenalia adorns the wall.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Of course the best test score in the world
              wasn't going to get me in the front door
              unless I had the blood test to go with it.


     EXT.  GATTACA.  NIGHT.

     While his fellow WORKERS sit on the steps at the service
     entrance to Gattaca, passing around an unlabeled bottle of clear
     liquor, VINCENT sits some distance away studying his text book.
     In the absence of a computer, he practices typing commands on a
     keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box.

     A tiny, seedy-looking man, GERMAN, forties, appears from
     nowhere and takes a seat beside him.

                           GERMAN
                      (offering his hand)
              Vincent, I'm German--
                      (anticipating Vincent's response)
              That's my name.

     He looks the apprehensive Vincent up and down.

                           VINCENT
              What do you think?

                           GERMAN
                      (shrugs)
              I think I could do something
                      (glancing to the text book)
              provided you know what you're doing
              and you can meet the terms.

     Vincent pulls a plastic e-money card from his overalls.

                           GERMAN
              You got a photo of yourself?

     Vincent produces a snapshot of himself - torn from the family
     portrait.  German feeds the snapshot into the pocket-sized
     computer he carries.  The picture is instantly scanned and
     appears on the computer's small color screen.  German returns
     the photograph and hastily departs.

     CAESAR, the elderly janitor, notices German's exit.

                           CAESAR
                      (to Vincent)
              I thought I told you not to get any ideas.


     High up the side of a building, washing windows, VINCENT pauses
     occasionally to practice typing commands on his cardboard keys -
     viewing a screen in his imagination - or the nightsky itself.
     He hears his name being called.

                           GERMAN
              Vincent...Vincent...

                           VINCENT
                      (staring through his glasses)
              German, is that you?

                           GERMAN
              Vincent, come down.  I've found him.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.  NIGHT.

     GERMAN leads VINCENT through a maze of corridors.

                           JEROME (VO)
              For the genetically superior, success
              is easier to attain but is by no means
              guaranteed.  After all, there is no gene
              for fate.  And when, for one reason or
              another, a member of the elite falls on
              hard times, their genetic identity becomes
              a valued commodity for the unscrupulous.
              One man's loss is another man's gain.

     He gives a conspiratorial nod to another passing DNA BROKER,
     both men carrying their palm-top computers.

                           GERMAN
                      (enthusiastically reading from data on
                      his portable screen as he walks)
              He has the heart of an ox.  He could run
              through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run.
              Actually, he was a big college swimming star.

                           VINCENT
              I hope he's not just a body.

                           GERMAN
              No problem.  Before he dropped out he was
              an honor student, the right majors--

                           VINCENT
              How do I square the accident?

                           GERMAN
                      (still reading data from his
                      palm-top computer)
              It happened in Australasia.  He checked
              in yesterday.  No family complications, no
              record he ever broke his neck.  As far as
              anybody's concerned, he's still a walking,
              talking, fully-productive member of society.
              You just have to get him off the pipe and
              fill in the last two years of his life.
                      (correcting himself)
              Excuse me, your life.

     German has stopped walking as if they have arrived.

                           VINCENT
                      (looking around for a likely
                      candidate but finding none)
              Where is he?

     German reaches towards a PARAPLEGIC sitting in his wheelchair
     in the stairwell directly in front of them, his head slumped, an
     incriminating bong nestled in his lap.  German pulls the man's
     head up by the hair.  EUGENE.  Depsite the patchy, unkempt
     beard and thick glaze over his eyes he bears a striking
     similarity to Vincent.  Vincent holds a mirror beside the face
     of the lethargic Eugene to compare his own reflection.

                           GERMAN
                      (smiling confidently
              What did I tell you?  Which one's the mirror?

                           VINCENT
                      (still not fully convinced)
              That's the hair color in his profile?

     German checks an entry in his computer:  "HAIR: BLONDE"

                           GERMAN
              Yeah.

                           VINCENT
                      (touching his own dark strands)
              I'd have to bleach my hair.

                           GERMAN
                      (irritated, impatient)
              Why are you inventing problems?  You two
              are a couple of goddam clones.  You look
              so right together, I want to double my fee.

                           VINCENT
                      (a thought occurs, addressing the
                      paraplegic for the first time)
              How tall are you?

                           EUGENE
                      (deadpan)
              Four foot six.

     Vincent grins, realizing that Eugene is referring to his seated
     height.  There is an instant connection between the two men.

                           VINCENT
              Okay, how tall did you used to be?

                           EUGENE
                      (apathetic, still under the
                      influence of whatever he's been smoking)
              Six one.

                           VINCENT
                      (to German, disappointed)
              He's too tall.

                           GERMAN
                      (shrugs)
              You can wear lifts.

                           VINCENT
              Even with lifts I'm never that tall.

                           GERMAN
              There's a way.


     INT.  BACKSTREET SURGERY.  NIGHT.

     In a primitive operating theatre, VINCENT lies on a table, his
     lower legs masked off for surgery.  The SURGEON switches on a
     surgical saw and lines it up with handdrawn incision marks.
     Metal struts are ready to elongate his legs.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     GERMAN wheels the dazed EUGENE into the apartment, cluttered
     with space paraphenalia.  One wheel of his rusting wheelchair is
     flimsily held on with wire.  VINCENT follows behind on crutches,
     both lower legs in casts and cross-braces.  Vincent signs the
     contract German puts in front of him.


     EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE A BAR.  DAY.

     EUGENE, glassy-eyed, strides out of a bar, past camera and into
     the street.  We hear a squeal of brakes and a sickening thud.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     EUGENE awakens with a scream, bathed in sweat, arms bound to a
     bed - the only real piece of furniture in the room.  VINCENT,
     sitting on a crate beside him, soaking a towel in a bowl of
     water, is taken by surprise.  Eugene continues to scream and
     thrash, fighting against his bindings.  Vincent stuffs the towel
     into Eugene's mouth and holds onto his arms.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued
              a man who was already dead.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT - BATHROOM.  NIGHT.

     VINCENT holds EUGENE's head over the toilet bowl as he vomits
     violently.  Eugene's paralysis and Vincent's broken legs make
     the operation doubly difficult.

     Finally Eugene has nothing left in his stomach to vomit.  He
     drops to the floor in exhaustion.  Vincent, also exhausted from
     the effort of holding Eugene over the bowl, joins him on the
     broken linoleum.  Both men stare up at the ceiling that carries
     a map of the constellation.

                           VINCENT
              You okay, Jerome?

                           EUGENE
                      (ironically referring to
                      their mutual immobility)
              Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?

     Vincent smiles.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE turns his nose up at the plate of boiled meat and
     potatoes that VINCENT puts in front of him.  Vincent catches the
     look.

                           VINCENT
              What's wrong with it?

                           EUGENE
              I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all,
              you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning
              how to be you.

                           VINCENT
                      (shrugs)
              Suit yourself.

                           EUGENE
                      (trying to be more diplomatic)
              Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful
              --I know you and that little broker--what do you
              call him?

                           VINCENT
              German.

                           EUGENE
              You're both going to a lot of trouble--
                      (trying to be tactful)
              Maybe you can con somebody into believing
              you're me to get your foot in the door--but
              once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm
              sure you're sincere...
                      (glancing to the space paraphenalia)
              ...but I was being groomed for something like
              this myself.  Even without the accident I don't
              think I would have made it.  My point is--how the
              hell do you expect to pull this off?

     Jerome merely stares back as if the thought of failure has never
     occurred to him.

                           VINCENT
                      (shrugs and states it simply)
              I don't know exactly, Jerome.

                           EUGENE
                      (laughing)
              At least you're honest.
                      (a thought occurs)
              Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're
              going to be Jerome, you may as well start
              getting used to it.

     NB:  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SCREENPLAY "VINCENT" IS REFERRED
     TO AS "JEROME".

     INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME looks through Eugene's personal effects, including a
     photograph album.  He is drawn to a swimming medal inside the
     album at a page displaying a photo of a wealthy, austere
     MOTHER - Eugene evidently comes from money.

     Even as he wheels into the room in his rickety wheelchair we see
     that EUGENE has the bearing of someone of good breeding.  He has
     a bag of blood on his lap.  More blood is being drawn from his
     arm through an IV.  Eugene catches Jerome looking at the album.

                           JEROME
                      (guiltily closing the book)
              I have to know where you come from.

                           EUGENE
              If anybody asks, tell them the truth--
              your family disowns you.  You are a
              disappointment, Jerome.

                           JEROME
                      (referring to Eugene's medal, impressed)
              What about this?

                           EUGENE
              Wrong color.  It's silver.
                      (tossing the bag of blood to Jerome)
              It's not easy living up to this.

     Eugene wheels away.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     JEROME practises writing with his right hand, trying to
     replicate Eugene's signature.

                           EUGENE
                      (wheeling by, looking over Jerome's
                      shoulder at the signature)
              It needs work.

                           JEROME
                      (rueful)
              You had to be a right-hander.

                           EUGENE
              Noone orders southpaws anymore.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     A pair of spectacles lie on the bed.  JEROME, still wearing his
     twin casts, sits behind an optometrist's portable examining
     device.  GERMAN hovering in the background, an OPTOMETRIST
     custom-fits JEROME with gossamer thin contact lenses.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Myopia is a dead giveaway - one of the earliest
              and most justifiable of the quality-of-life
              corrections.  Anybody with impaired vision is
              certain to be suffering from all the other
              deficiencies of a "nonadvantaged" birth.

                           GERMAN
                      (inspecting the lens in Jerome's eye)
              It's no good.  I can see an edge.  He may as
              well walk in there with a cane.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     The Optometrist has been replaced in the living room with a
     BLACK MARKET DENTIST who bonds JEROME's small, gapped teeth to
     match EUGENE's perfectly straight, white picket fences.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     Hair already bleached and cut to match Eugene's hairstyle,
     JEROME sits in a chair against a hastily erected white paper
     backdrop.  From his wheelchair, EUGENE puts the finishing
     touches to Jerome's hair.  He wheels himself out of the way.
     The final accomplice in Jerome's deception, a BLACK MARKET
     COMPUTER GRAPHICS DESIGNER, takes Jerome's photo with a video
     camera.  Manipulating the captured image, the Designer morphs
     Jerome's face into the face of Eugene.  The resulting photo that
     spits out of a printer is neither one nor the other but an
     acceptable combination of the two.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     EUGENE is starting to prepare Jerome's specimen bags for the
     first time.  He winces in pain as he plucks several hairs from
     his head.  JEROME, now out of his casts, prepares job
     applications.

                           EUGENE
                      (still grimacing, referring to the follicles)
              You really need that much?

                           JEROME
              More than that.  You'll get used to it.

                           EUGENE
                      (yanking out another hair)
              God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?

                           JEROME
                      (inspecting a hair follicle)
              Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in
              this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star.
              I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.

                           EUGENE
                      (marvelling at Jerome's earnestness)
              God, you're serious, aren't you?

     Jerome ignores him.  Having learnt his lesson, he hands the
     envelopes to EUGENE to lick the flaps.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     JEROME is doing a late-minute cram on a geriatric computer from
     the late 1990's.  Checking the time, Jerome hurriedly picks up
     the shirt that EUGENE has been ironing from a prone position on
     the floor.

                           JEROME
              It's not too late to back out.

                           EUGENE
              You don't know what a relief it is not to
              be me.  Are you sure you want the job?

     Jerome contemplates the question for a moment.

                           JEROME
              What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the bladder bag he wears)
              Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may
              as well pay my rent.

     Jerome hurrise to the bathroom where, with some difficulty, he
     inserts his urine device for the first time.  The new improved
     Jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview.


     INT.  GATTACA CORPORATION - TESTING LAB.  DAY.

     JEROME emerges from a bathroom and hands a TECHNICIAN his
     plastic cup full of fraudulent urine and inserts it into the
     analyzer.

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (reading off the profile)
              Congratulations.

                           JEROME
                      (perplexed)
              What about the interview?

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (referring to the cup)
              That was it.


     EXT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME, scarcely able to disguise his delight, exits Gattaca,
     trying not to stare at the superb specimens who are now his
     "colleagues".

                           JEROME (VO)
              The majority of people are now made-to-order.
              What began as a means to rid society of
              inheritable diseases has become a way to design
              your offspring--the line between health and
              enhancement blurred forever.  Eyes can always be
              brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body
              stronger, a life longer.  Everyone seeks to give
              their child the best chance but the most skilled
              geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.

     In a nearby park MODEL CHILDREN from MODEL PARENTS play
     together.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Anyone who is the product of an altered
              DNA is proudly referred to as a "DAN",
              "self-made man or woman", "man-child". 


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME wheels EUGENE out of their housing project.  He takes in
     the neighborhood for the last time.  We focus on a POOR COUPLE
     cradling an INFANT.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Those parents who, for moral or, more likely
              economic reasons, refrain from tampering with
              their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail
              to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children
              to a life of routine discrimination.

     We glimpse other PEOPLE in the neighborhood.  They appear poor
     but, for the most part, physically normal.  However a pall of
     gloom hangs over them.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Officially they are called "In-Valids"*.  Also
              known as "godchildren", "men-of-god", "faith births",
              "blackjack births", "deficients", "defectives",
              "genojunk", "ge-gnomes", "the fucked-up people".

     [* "IN-VALID" pronounced as in "an invalid license"]

                           JEROME (VO)
              They are the "healthy ill".  They don't
              actually have anything yet - they may never.
              But since few of the pre-conditions can be
              cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them
              as if they were already sick.

     As they enter a car, driven by GERMAN, Jerome spies a beautiful
     young GIRL, 11, sitting on the steps of the housing project,
     staring forlornly into space.  While there is no outward sign of
     any deficiency, she is somehow aware that she is damaged goods.

     Jerome glances in the rearview mirror.

                           JEROME (VO)
              By means of a donor I have cheated the
              system for the last four years to open doors
              that would otherwise be closed to me.

     Jerome wheels Eugene into the palatial condominium complex where
     the two men now reside.


     INT.  GATTACA.  PRESENT DAY.

     We return to JEROME's reflection in the glass.  Other GATTACA
     EMPLOYEES are gradually gathering behind him.

                           JEROME (VO)
              In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen
              quickly through the ranks of Gattaca.  Only one
              of the Mission Directors has ever come close
              to discovering my true identity.

     We now see what Jerome has been gazing at through the window
     the whole time - the sight that has brought a hush to the
     complex.  Through an open office door lies the body of a large
     man - the MURDERED DIRECTOR, lying where he has just been
     discovered, in a pool of his own blood.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Strange to think, he may have more success
              exposing me in death than he did in life.

     Jerome wipes his eye and also goes to investigate.  We focus on
     an extreme close up of his EYELASH.  Loosened by Jerome's hand,
     it breaks free and floats gently down to the floor where it
     comes to rest.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  MORNING.

     DETECTIVE HUGO, late-forties, wearing a crime-scene hygenic suit
     and gloves and a full clear mask - looking more like a surgeon
     or a toxic waste worker than a detective - places a blood-
     spattered computer keyboard alongside the Director's shattered
     skull.  The indentations match the blunt corner of the keyboard.
     Hugo detaches the dangling keyboard from its parent computer and
     seals the likely murder weapon in a marked, transparent plastic
     bag.

     A CREW of similarly-suited homicide detectives systematically
     vacuum the surrounding office area with metallic, industrial-
     looking mini-vacs.  Once each work space has been vacuumed, the
     transparent plastic vacuum bag is detached, sealed and labelled.

     OTHER DETECTIVES video the scene with camcorders.  Video prints
     spit out of the cameras for instant inspection.


     EXT.  GATTACA - LANDSCAPED GARDENS.  DAY.

     A silicon police tape cordons off the crime scene.  From the
     landscaped garden, a crowd of GATTACA EMPLOYEES view the
     proceedings through the glass walls.

                           EMPLOYEE 1
                      (staring at the Director's body)
              Awful.

                           EMPLOYEE 2
              Yeah, awful it didn't happen sooner.

     Nervous smirks from nearby employees.  We focus on JEROME.
     Standing slightly apart from the others, he does not appear to
     share the joke, or perhaps even hear it.  Jerome watches, wide-
     eyed, as a DETECTIVE approaches his work station with a mini-
     vac.  A chill goes through Jerome as the detective's cleaner
     passes over his desk.

     Jerome is distracted by a smear on the window, obstructing his
     view.  Without thinking, he breathes on the glass and rubs the
     smear away with his elbow.  Nearby, elderly janitor, CAESAR
     notices Jerome's fastidious act and reads the panic in Jerome's
     eyes.  DIRECTOR JOSEF suddenly appears at Jerome's shoulder.
     Standing a pace behind the Director, computer notepad in hand,
     is IRENE.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              You're lucky to be getting out of this.

                           JEROME
              We're still going ahead as planned?

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              The launch window is only open until week's
              end.  Tragic though this event may be, it
              hasn't stopped the planets turning.

     He glances towards a group of Detectives headed by HUGO.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              You'll have to excuse me, Jerome.  I have to
              meet with the authorities--naturally, we're
              co-operating in any way, although I won't
              tolerate a major disruption.
                      (as he departs)
              I wish I was going with you, Jerome.

     As the pair depart, Jerome and Irene exchange a glance.  Irene
     is also aware of Jerome's unease.


     INT.  GATTACA - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

     We focus on JEROME's eyelash, still lying on the floor.
     A huge crescent-shaped hair that fills the screen.  Suddenly
     there is a roar of a mini-vac and the eyelash is sucked up.  We
     follow the eyelash's journey, down the throat of the cleaner
     into the specimen bag where it is sucked against the bag's
     clear, plastic wall.


     INT.  GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     The DIRECTOR's corpse is sealed in a plastic bodybag and wheeled
     away on a gurney.  The blood and other body matter from the
     murder scene is sucked up by a portable wet-vac and the sample
     bag appropriately labeled.


     EXT.  GATTACA - COURTYARD CAFETERIA.  DAY

     A chime sounds over the P.A. follwed by an announcement.

                           ANNOUNCER (OC)
              Thank you for your co-operation.  Please
              return to your work stations immediately.

     The PROGRAMMERS get to their feet en masse and begin filing into
     the work room.

                           EMPLOYEE 3
                      (sarcastic aside)
              What, no counselling?


     INT.  GATTACA COMPUTER COMPLEX - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE.  DAY.

     A WOMAN ASSISTANT whose keyboard was used in the attack has to
     pause as a MAINTENANCE WORKER gives her work station a final
     spray to return it to its former pristine condition.  A new
     keyboard is plugged into her monitor to replace the one taken as
     evidence.


     INT.  GATTACA COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     JEROME opens his desk drawer to check his comb, now plucked
     completely clean.  He carefully places two of Eugene's hairs to
     the comb and scatters another bag of fraudulent matter around
     his work station.


     INT.  GATTACA - SIMULATOR ROOM.  DAY.

     In a large, bare room a simulator does a slow dance back and
     forth on its hydralic legs, miming the path of the space
     craft Jerome will soon be aboard.  The simulation ends and
     JEROME exits the simulator through a small door.  IRENE
     hesitantly approaches, carrying a slim electronic tablet.

                           IRENE
              Excuse me, Jerome.  I'm sorry to bother you.

     Jerome turns, not displeased by the interruption.

                           JEROME
              No bother.

                           IRENE
                      (referring to her notepad)
              I've been asked to compile a log for the
              investigators--they want to know everyone's
              whereabouts last night.

                           JEROME
              Last night?  I was at home.

     Irene makes a note with her stylus.

                           IRENE
              Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?

                           JEROME
              No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.

     Irene makes another note.

                           JEROME
                      (wry smile)
              Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about
              you?  Where were you last night?

                           IRENE
              I was at home.

                           JEROME
              Were you alone?

                           IRENE
                      (hesitant)
              Yes.

                           JEROME
                      (teasing)
              So we don't know for sure about you, either.

                           IRENE
                      (wary, wondering where the
                      conversation is headed)
              No.

                           JEROME
              Why don't we say we were together?

                           IRENE
                      (confused)
              Why would we do that?

                           JEROME
              I have better things to do this week than
              answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot.
              Don't you?

     Irene contemplates the question.

                           JEROME
                      (gently pressing)
              Well, shall we say we spent the evening together?

     Irene is still unsure whether or not Jerome is serious.

                           IRENE
              To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to know
              what that was like.

     Irene turns and departs.  Jerome watches her go.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     The paraplegic EUGENE, seated by the window, meticulously cuts
     a long fingernail into numerous clippings.  He places the
     clippings in small plastic bags and seals them.  He then begins
     to fill tiny sachets with blood.  He turns as he hears JEROME
     enter down the spiral staircase with the groceries.

                           EUGENE
              You didn't forget the truffles?

     JEROME places the items in the refrigerator in the bathroom and
     retrieves a bottle of vodka - the vodka incongruous-looking
     beside the blood and urine specimens.  Joining Eugene at his
     workbench, he pours them both a drink.

                           EUGENE
                      (sensing something amiss, trying
                      to keep his humor)
              Who died?

                           JEROME
              The Mission Director.

                           EUGENE
                      (misinterpreting the deadpan remark)
              You wish.

                           JEROME
              They found him in his office this morning--
              beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.

     Eugene takes in the news, a smile broadening across his face.

                           EUGENE
              What an act of benevolence--a service to the
              community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing
              between you and ignition.

                           JEROME
              He was still warm when they confirmed.

                           EUGENE
                      (confused by Jerome's attitude)
              This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?

                           JEROME
              The place is crawling with Hoovers.

                           EUGENE
              So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?

     Jerome shoots him a glance for the inappropriate remark.

                           JEROME
              That's not the point.

                           EUGENE
                      (scoffing)
              Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the
              "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--
                      (glancing up to the night sky)
              you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.
                      (gently chiding)
              Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.

                           JEROME
                      (still tempering Eugene's enthusiasm)
              You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got
              my final physical tomorrow.

     Jerome wheels Eugene's chair to a specially constructed platform
     that allows the wheels to spin in mid-air.  Jerome tapes an
     electrode to Eugene's chest and attaches the wire to a slim
     recording device.  Eugene begins to spin the wheel of the chair
     faster and faster.  Jerome monitors Eugene's steady heartbeat
     through a set of headphones.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  NIGHT.

     The complex is virtually empty - only a handful of the hundreds
     of PROGRAMMERS working late into the night.  IRENE approaches
     JEROME's work station on the pretext of delivering some
     documents.  Trying to act casually, she looks under the papers
     on his desk, then opens the top desk drawer.

     We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the comb lying there - the two
     hairs trapped between the teeth of the comb.  Irene removes one
     of the follicles and drops it into an envelope she is carrying.


     INT.  24-HOUR SEQUENCING LAB.  NIGHT.

     "SEQUENCING-WHILE-U-WAIT".  Similar to a 1-hour photo lab, the
     store - little more than a booth - displays a price list on the
     wall.  "FULL SEQUENCE - $80".  IRENE waits in line with a cross-
     section of other CUSTOMERS.  She checks the contents of the
     envelope that contains the hair.

     The YOUNG WOMAN in line ahead of her allows the TECHNICIAN to
     take a swab from her full lips with a Q-tip.

                           TECHNICIAN
              How old?

                           YOUNG WOMAN
                      (confused)
              Me?

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (mustering patience, referring
                      to the Q-tip)
              The specimen.

                           YOUUNG WOMAN
                      (proudly)
              I kissed him five minutes ago.  A real good one.

     Overhearing, several PEOPLE in the line snicker.

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (long-suffering)
              I'll see what I can do.

     The technician hands the swab to an ASSISTANT.  The Young Woman
     is handed a number and takes a seat.  Irene hands her envelope
     over the counter.  She too is handed a number.  We follow
     Jerome's follicle as another TECHNICIAN places it in an
     analyzing machine.


     INT/EXT.  SEQUENCING LAB / PARKING LOT.  NIGHT.

     The TECHNICIAN returns the envelope to IRENE along with a
     miniature compact disc.

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (remarking on the profile result)
              9.4...very nice.

     Irene does not appear to share the technician's enthusiasm.
     She emerges from the sequencing lab and enters her car.  Taking
     a palm-top computer from her purse, she inserts the disc into
     the computer.  Jerome's counterfeit genetic profile appears on
     the screen.  The details confirm her worst fears.


     EXT.  MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and EUGENE, dressed to the nines, pull up in the car
     to a darkened doorway in a poorly lit street.  A VALET appears
     out of the shadows.  Familiar with the car, he goes immediately
     to the trunk to retrieve Eugene's collapsible wheelchair.
     Jerome tips the valet - a credit card wiped through a device.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB.  NIGHT.

     The chic, elegant establishment inside belies its darkened
     exterior.  JEROME wheels EUGENE into a decadent dinner club
     full of an odd assortment of people.  They are immediately
     greeted respectfully by MICHAEL, the owner and maitre d'.
     Jerome and Eugene are obviously regulars.

                           MICHAEL
              Good evening, gentlemen.  Your table is ready.
                      (referring to Jerome's mission)
              Not long now, sir.  You'll be upstairs
              before you know it.  We're going to miss you.

                           JEROME
              Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff.
              I'd like to take one of your chefs with me.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB.  NIGHT.

     In a secluded booth JEROME and EUGENE toast from a bottle of
     1999 vintage Bordeaux.  Eugene drinks longer than Jerome.
     Jerome dabs his mouth with a napkin.  He fails to notice a
     minute FLAKE OF SKIN dislodged from his chin.  We follow the
     flake as it comes to rest beneath the table.

     LATER, Eugene and Jerome watch COUPLES dancing a samba on the
     dance floor.  A WAITER vacuums the table with a discreet,
     handheld miniature vacuum while a WAITRESS clears the plates.
     She accidentally drops a knife onto Eugene's leg.

                           WAITRESS
                      (aghast at the sight of his lifeless legs)
              I'm so sorry.  Did I hurt you?

                           EUGENE
                      (smiling, a trace of bitterness)
              Honey, if you'd hurt me, I'd be cured.

     Eugene, the worse for drink, gropes for the waitress's leg but
     she easily avoids his clumsy pass.

                           EUGENE
              You want to meet a real-life spaceman?

     Jerome, always aware, scanning the club, suddenly spies
     NAPOLEON, his Gattaca colleague, on the other side of the
     room.  Napoleon is taking a hit from a vial concealed in his
     hand.  Jerome abruptly turns his back to avoid being recognized.

                           JEROME
              Let's get out of here.

                           EUGENE
                      (knocking back his drink,
                      misinterpreting the hasty departure)
              You're right, there's more atmosphere
              where you're going.


     INT/EXT.  CAR.  NIGHT.

     Driving along the freeway, Jerome's car suddenly dives down an
     escape road.  EUGENE looks sideways at JEROME.

                           JEROME
              You drive.


     INT/EXT.  CAR.  NIGHT.

     The car careens around and around a small circular building -
     a cloud of dust billowing up behind the car.  We focus on a
     BRICK wedged against the car's gas pedal.

     EUGENE is at the wheel, JEROME in the passenger seat.

     The hard turn is repeated with increasing recklessness, Eugene
     fighting to control the bucking car.

                           EUGENE
                      (screaming in both fear and exhilaration)
              I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!

                           JEROME
              Keep going!!  Keep going!!

     Finally the car spins to a halt in a cloud of dust.  When the
     dust settles it is revealed that they have been circling the
     base of a huge satellite dish in a desolate location.


     EXT.  SATELLITE DISH.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE lies on the hood of the car, leaning against the
     windshield, drinking from a bottle of vodka.  In the
     background, the unmanned satellite dish.  JEROME relieves
     himself against the building at the base of the satellite.

                           EUGENE
                      (gently chiding Jerome over the joyride)
              You idiot.  You could ruin everything
              with a stunt like that.

     Eugene spies a spacecraft launching from Gattaca city.

                           EUGENE
                      (gazing up into the night sky)
              At least up there your piss will be worth something.
                      (smiling at the thought)
              You'll all be showering in it, right?

                           JEROME
                      (zipping his fly)
              And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the
              time it's filtered.

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the rocket ship)
              What is that one?

     Jerome doesn't bother to look in the direction of the craft but
     merely glances to his watch.  He joins Eugene on the hood of the
     car.

                           JEROME
                      (looking at his watch)
              11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.

                           EUGENE
              How long do you stay up there before you go?

                           JEROME
              A day or so.

                           EUGENE
                      (beaming)
              I still can't believe they're sending you to
              the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be
              born, on a mission to discover the origin
              of life.

     Eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to Jerome.

                           JEROME
              You should be going instead of me.

     Jerome taps Eugene's lifeless legs with his foot.

                           JEROME
              Up there they wouldn't be a problem.

                           EUGENE
                      (glancing heavenwards, shaking his head)
              You know I'm scared of heights.


     INT.  CRIME LABORATORY - AUTOPSY ROOM.  NIGHT.

     The body and clothing of the MISSION DIRECTOR, lying on a metal
     examining table is scanned with a blue-light magnifying
     instrument.  Fingernail specimens are taken for analysis.  In
     another area of the laboratory, the labelled vacuum bags are
     attached to analyzers and the contents sucked out and
     automatically identified.  ID names and photographs of GATTACA
     EMPLOYEES begin appearing on a computer screen at high speed
     along with other personal details - all data automatically
     logged for later review.

     The photographs and personal details of JEROME and IRENE flash
     past, amongst the faces of other employees.

     We focus on a magnified close up of JEROME'S EYELASH, still
     clinging stubbornly to the side of its specimen bag.  We
     continue to follow its journey as it is finally sucked into the
     analyzer.


     INT.  CRIME LAB - ANALYZER MACHINE.  NIGHT.

     Inside the machine, a minute, cell-thin sliver is sliced from
     JEROME'S EYELASH and analyzed.


     INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S CRIME LAB.  NIGHT.

     A severed HUMAN TONGUE sits on a tray in a sterile, sealed
     chamber.  Using gloves that protrude through the chamber's glass
     wall, face buried in a binocular eyepiece, the INVESTIGATOR
     takes a swab from the tongue.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to the tongue, as he inserts the
                      tip of the swab into an analyzer)
              Let's see what you've got to say for yourself.

     A FEMALE ASSISTANT, looking on, hardly has time to smile at the
     remark before information begins to appear on a nearby computer
     terminal.  The computer gradually builds a portrait of the owner
     of the tongue using genetic predictors.  The Investigator
     wanders over to the window as his Assistant reads the
     information from the screen.

                           ASSISTANT
              The tongue is male.  Mature.  Blonse hair.
              Brown eyes.  Light complexion.  Between
              5'11 and 6'1.  Pronounced Caucasian nose.
              Thin lips.  Weak chin.  Lobeless ears.
              Prematurely balding.  Slightly bow-legged.
              Broad shoulders.  Barrel chest...
                      (pause)
              Blind.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (interest piqued)
              Blind?
                      (mildly amused, checking the
                      monitor for himself)
              The tongue is blind?

                           ASSISTANT
                      (confused)
              Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shrugs)
              Someone who is mindful that the blind
              still speak.

     The INVESTIGATOR is alerted by the chime of his nearby computer.
     On the screen, he discovers the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT
     and the accompanying flashing message: TRACKING IN-VALID
     883000181105-10  - NEW DATA -


     INT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX - PARKING GARAGE.  NIGHT.

     Having plugged his car into an overnight charger, JEROME pushes
     EUGENE in his wheelchair to the elevator.  Bottle in hand,
     Eugene leans over and vomits on the ground.  Jerome shakes his
     head resignedly.  Eugene looks drunkenly up at Jerome.

                           EUGENE
                      (sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit)
              I'm sorry.  Did you want it?

     Jerome meets Eugene's gaze.  There is a trace of bitterness
     in Eugene's drunken smile.

                           EUGENE
              Let me get it for you.

     Eugene bends down to scoop up some vomit with his hand but the
     elevator arrives and Jerome quickly wheels him away.  Eugene's
     head flops to the side as he passes out.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME unlocks EUGENE's condo and wheels his chair inside.  We
     see their reflection in a full-length mirror as Jerome pushes
     Eugene to the bedroom.  After removing Eugene's soiled clothing,
     he heaves the tall man from the chair and onto the bed.

                           EUGENE
                      (maudlin, sobbing like a child)
              I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

                           JEROME
                      (attempting to comfort)
              It's okay, Eugene.

                           EUGENE
              You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was
              doing when I walked in front of that car--

                           JEROME
              --What car?--Go to sleep.

                           EUGENE
              --I walked right in front of it.  I was never
              more sober in my life.

     Jerome looks at Eugene's lifeless legs, trying to cover his
     shock at the revelation.

                           JEROME
              It's all right.

                           EUGENE
                      (grabbing Jerome by the collar)
              I'm proud of you, Vincent.

     Eugene's head falls back onto the pillow.

                           JEROME
                      (smiling to himself)
              You must be drunk to call me Vincent.

     But Eugene does not reply, drifting into sleep once again.
     Jerome pulls a blanket over him.

     On the verge of leaving, Jerome's attention is drawn to a wall
     on the far side of the room.  Approaching the wall, near
     Eugene's mirrored closet, he detects a faint mechanical whir
     coming from inside the adjacent condominium.  Jerome
     contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead
     - climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME fastidiously vacuums with an upright cleaner.  Using a
     hose attachment he cleans around a picture frame that contains
     Jerome's original computer keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a
     cardboard box.


     INT. GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     In the vast room of COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS we pull-focus to
     discover that we have been filming the complex through the
     transparent specimen bag containing JEROME'S EYELASH.

     On the mezzanine floor overlooking the scene of the crime,
     the INVESTIGATOR holds the bag, transfixed by the lash.  The
     lead homicide detective, DETECTIVE HUGO, finishes interviewing
     a GATTACA SECURITY GUARD and approaches the Investigator.
     A large telescope in the background.

     Although Hugo is deferential to his more youthful superior, his
     body language betrays his displeasure.  Hugo clearly does not
     relish the Investigator's involvement in his case.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              I don't understand why you were dragged out
              here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your
              time--a no-nothing case like this.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (gently rebuking his subordinate)
              A man's dead, Detective.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log,
              alibis, grudges...

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Grudges?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (looking out over the balcony)
              I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes.
              The Director was not...
                      (searching for the words)
              ...universally loved.  He was leading the
              cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at
              a room full of motives.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shaking his head adamantly,
                      referring to the bag in his hand)
              No, this is your man.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (not so convinced)
              With respect, Sir--it may be the only
              unaccountable specimen but the profile
              suggests--

                           INVESTIGATOR
              --What about his profile?

     Hugo refers to a print-out of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT's profile
     including his Genetic Quotient.  (The fifteen-year-old photo of
     Vincent now bears little resemblance to his assumed identity.)

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital
              heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen
              has been here but there's an 80 percent chance
              the owner of that eyelash has already died
              himself from natural causes.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (terse)
              So there's a 20 percent chance he's not dead.

     Detective Hugo goes to comment further, then revises his
     remark in his head before speaking.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Even if this Vincent Luca is alive, is it
              likely he could bludgeon a man to death?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              No.  Not likely.

     The Investigator's tone suggests that the identity of the
     culprit is no longer a matter for debate.  There is an awkward
     pause before the Detective falls into step with his superior.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              I take it you're thinking along the lines of a
              robbery gone sour--a thief disturbed in the act?

     The Investigator merely shrugs.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (skeptical)
              Of course that doesn't jibe with what we
              found.  This was an angry killing.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (glancing to the profile in Hugo's hand)
              Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile
              indicates a proclivity for violence.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (trying to appear co-operative)
              I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for
              any family or associate connections--

                           INVESTIGATOR
              --I've already run it.  There's no record
              of any living relative.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              What a pity.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (irritated, glancing to the sample bag)
              Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and
              found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's
              minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.

     We focus on JEROME at his work station.  Although he continues
     to work, he clrarly feels the presence of the INVESTIGATORS on
     the mezzanine floor behind him.

     A MEDICAL DIRECTOR approaches the programmer in the neighboring
     work station - NAPOLEON, the programmer Jerome encountered in
     the nightclub the previous evening.

                           MEDICAL DIRECTOR
              Napoleon, you're late for your substance test.

     Napoleon looks up, ashen-faced.  Jerome intervenes.

                           JEROME
              Director, Napoleon's helping me today.

     The Director regards both men suspiciously.

                           MEDICAL DIRECTOR
              Well, you take it for him, Jerome.

     The Medical Director departs.  Napoleon, stunned by the
     reprieve, approaches Jerome's work station and pretends to
     study the program on his computer screen.

                           NAPOLEON
              Why did you do that?

                           JEROME
                      (exiting to the testing lab)
              Don't worry about it.


     INT.  GATTACA - TESTING LAB.  DAY.

     From behind we observe JEROME standing in front of LAMAR,
     issuing forth his steady stream of fraudulent urine.


     EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - WORKOUT CENTER.  DAY.

     Twenty GATTACA EMPLOYEES, identically-outfitted men and women,
     run in a perfectly straight line towards the tranquil lake of
     the picturesque grounds, never getting any closer to their goal.
     They run at a steady 10mph on twenty identical state-of-the-art
     treadmill machines sunken into the floor and arranged in a
     uniform row facing a floor to ceiling window.  The strain is
     beginning to show on many of the faces.  The heartrate of each
     employee is monitored via a wireless electrode attached to the
     chest.

     Outside in the sunshine the next batch of twenty EMPLOYEES
     limbers up in readiness for their physical.  JEROME's only
     preparation consists of thoughtfully dragging on a
     cigarette while staring out at the man-made lake.  His
     nonchalant attitude disheartens nearby colleagues, including
     IRENE who is amongst a group of workers excused from the run
     by benevolent, over-protective TRAINERS.

                           TRAINER
              You're excused, Irene.  You may resume your duties.

     On the way into the work-out facility Jerome stubs out his
     cigarette in a stainless steel ashtray.  Only we are aware of
     the slim credit card-sized recording device that he furtively
     slips out of his cigarette pack and secrets in his hand.  As he
     takes his place on one of the treadmills and adheres the
     cordless electrode to his chest, Jerome surreptitiously attaches
     his device to the underside of the running machine's control
     panel.


     INT.  GATTACA - WORK-OUT OBSERVATION ROOM.  DAY.

     From a mezzanine floor above the work-out room, LAMAR, the
     medical officer, monitors computer read-outs displaying the
     pace and pulse of the runners on each treadmill machine.


     INT. GATTACA - WORK-OUT CENTER.  DAY.

     One by one the GATTACA EMPLOYEES drop out until JEROME is the
     sole remaining runner.  Several of the other employees stand
     around and watch Jerome run as they towel off.

     He appears under little duress, staring directly ahead,
     seemingly in a trance.  As we focus on his chest, only we are
     aware of the sound of his furiously pounding heart making a lie
     of his calm exterior.


     INT.  GATTACA - WORK-OUT OBSERVATION ROOM.  DAY.

     Jerome's heart registers a far more measured beat on the
     computer in the observation room.  The DIRECTOR is at LAMAR's
     shoulder, beaming proudly.

                           LAMAR
                      (marveling at Jerome's heartrate)
              Six miles later it's still beating like a
              Goddamn metronome.  I could play piano by that
              heartbeat of his.

     The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO enter the observation room,
     escorted by IRENE.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Director Josef, this is our lead Investigator.

     The two men exchange a polite handshake.  However the
     Investigator is immediately taken with the SOLE RUNNER with his
     back to him, on the treadmill below.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              How often do you test, Director?

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              Often.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (intrigued)
              Surely you know what you have.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we
              can hardly turn the boat around.

     On the treadmill below, Jerome glances to his watch as he runs,
     the distress starting to show.  Caught up in the conversation,
     Lamar has forgotten to end the work-out.  Remembering, he
     finally presses the "WARM-DOWN" button, slowing the treadmill.

                           LAMAR
                      (still marveling at Jerome)
              I swear if I went to lunch and came back, he'd
              still be there.

     We focus on Jerome's recording device attached to the bottom of
     the control panel.  It clicks to a stop, indicating that the
     bogus heartbeat recording has ended before the workout.

     The heartbeat monitor in the observation room suddenly races
     from 80 to 250 beats per minute.  Lamar catches the discrepancy
     out of the corner of his eye but before he can take a second
     look, Jerome has whipped his electrode from his chest.  The
     physician shrugs it off as a glitch in the machine.

     The Investigator has turned his back on Jerome to face the
     Director.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              We believe we have a suspect.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              What a relief.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (referring to the profile of VINCENT
                      on Hugo's computer notepad)
              This unaccountable specimen was found in
              the south wing corridor.

     In the room below, Jerome nonchalantly steps off the treadmill,
     stealthily retrieves the recording device from beneath the
     control panel and returns it to his cigarette pack.

     He casually wipes off drops of sweat from the machine with a
     towel, briefly glances to Irene with the Investigators and exits
     to the locker room.

     The Director idly regards the image of VINCENT on Hugo's
     handheld screen.  He does not recognize the face.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              An age enhancement is being prepared as
              we speak.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (referring to his assistant)
              Irene will make it available to security.


     INT.  GATTACA - LOCKER ROOM.  DAY.

     JEROME wears his assured smile all the way along the corridor
     and into the now empty locker room.  He exchanges a cheery
     greeting with an exiting COLLEAGUE, enters a shower stall,
     closes the door behind him and promptly collapses on the shower
     stall floor.

     The effects of the gruelling work-out are only now apparent.  No
     longer sucking up the pain, he gulps air into his oxygen-starved
     lungs, his heart looking for a way through his tightened chest.
     He writhes in agony on the white-tiled floor - a brutal reminder
     of the physical frailty he seeks to disguise.


     EXT.  GATTACA - GARDEN.  LUNCHTIME.

     In Gattaca's perfectly landscaped gardens JEROME, dressed and
     recovered from his ordeal, joins his COLLEAGUES for lunch at one
     of the umbrella-covered tables.  While most of the others pick
     at unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication,
     Jerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray.

     The sight of the juicy steak is greeted with envious looks from
     his colleagues.  Jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by
     liberally sprinkling salt onto the meat.

     However when Jerome looks over towards IRENE, she avoids eye
     contact.  When she abruptly gets up and leaves, Jerome follows -
     thinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby
     trashcan.  A janitor reaches for the napkin.  It is the Old
     Janitor, CAESAR, from Jerome's former life.

                           CAESAR
              I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow.

     The two men exchange a conspiratorial smile.


     EXT.  GATTACA - WIND FARM.  AFTERNOON.

     A forest of wind turbines, supplying energy to the aerospace
     complex.  However the blades of the turbines are motionless in
     the still afternoon.  JEROME finally catches up with IRENE.  She
     turns, unsurprised by his appearance.  Standing beside her, he
     looks out over the complex as if he too has come for the view.

                           JEROME
                      (eyes fixed on the view)
              We were looking at each other.  You stopped.

     Irene, also keeps her gaze ahead.

                           IRENE
              I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.

                           JEROME
                      (shrugging as if it makes
                      no difference to him)
              We were just looking.

                           IRENE
              I know about you.

     Jerome turns to her, startled, trying to read her face.  Irene
     takes a deep breath and abruptly plucks a long, dark hair from
     her head.

                           IRENE
                      (offering the hair to Jerome)
              Here, take it.

     Jerome, confused, takes the hair - more in reflex than intent.

                           IRENE
                      (a challenge)
              If you're still interested, let me know.

     Jerome contemplates the hair in his fingers for a moment, then
     deliberately lets it fall to the grounf.

                           JEROME
                      (never taking his eyes from her)
              Sorry, the wind caught it.

     Irene meets his gaze.  There is not a breath of wind.  The
     hair lies, plainly visible on the ground.


     EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE COMPLEX.  AFTERNOON.

     As JEROME and IRENE walk between the wind turbines, Jerome
     pretends not to notice that Irene keeps furtively checking the
     pulse on her wrist.  They pause in the shade.

                           JEROME
                      (as if making conversation)
              Have they found our friend?

                           IRENE
              Friend?

                           JEROME
                      (shrugs)
              It was a mercy-killing after all.

                           IRENE
              They found an eyelash.

                           JEROME
              Where?

                           IRENE
              In the South Wing.

                           JEROME
              Does it have a name?

                           IRENE
              Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--
                      (trying to come up with the last name)
              --somebody.

     Jerome turns away to disguise his alarm.  He quickly recovers.

                           JEROME
              Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.

                           IRENE
                      (a smile playing around her lips)
              You celebrate, Jerome?


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDO.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE talks irritably on the phone, examining a container from
     a newly opened case of hair bleach.

                           EUGENE
                      (into phone)
              --I know what I ordered.  I ordered "Honey
              Dawn" and you sent me "Summer Wheat".

     JEROME descends the staircase, taking the steps two at a time.
     He immediately goes to the refrigerator, removing trays of
     samples.  Eugene abruptly hangs up the phone.

                           JEROME (OC)
              Call German.

                           EUGENE
              Any particular reason?

                           JEROME
                      (collecting up sample bags from
                      the work bench)
              We can't stay here.

                           EUGENE
              What are you talking about?

                           JEROME
              They think I offed the Director.

     Eugene wheels himself over to Jerome, unconcerned.

                           EUGENE
              What makes them think that?

                           JEROME
              They found my eyelash.

                           EUGENE
                      (a flicker of anxiety)
              Where?

                           JEROME
              In a corridor.

                           EUGENE
                      (blasÈ once again)
              Could be worse.  They could have found
              it in your eye.

     Jerome half-smiles despite the situation.

                           JEROME
                      (resuming his collection of samples)
              Come on--we're taking off.

                           EUGENE
              I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go.
              Not on your life--

                           JEROME
              --You don't understand, they'll make the
              connection, they'll hoover again.  We should
              cut our losses.

                           EUGENE
                      (angrily grabbing a tray from Jerome's hands)
              Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting
              like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash
              to you.  They won't believe that one of their
              elite navigators could have suckered them for the
              last five years.

                           JEROME
              They'll recognize me.

                           EUGENE
                      (scoffing)
              How could they recognize you?
                      (referring to the torn photo of
                      20-year-old Vincent on the wall)
              I don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a
              choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession,
              turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out--
              find out what we can but change nothing.  This is
              a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken
              worse heat than this.
                      (angry now)
              Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go
              belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I
              wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me
              now.  I've put too much into this.
                      (returning the samples to the fridge)
              Besides, this stuff is mine.  I had other offers,
              you know.  I could have rented myself out to
              somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in
              there and finish the job myself?
                      (meeting Jerome's gaze)
              We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like
              we planned.

     Jerome slumps down in a chair, Eugene's tirade starting to get
     to him.

                           EUGENE
              And keep your lashes on your lids where
              they belong.  How could you be so careless?

                           JEROME
              I'm sorry.
                      (reluctant admission)
              I think I was crying.

     Eugene is uncomfortable at the notion.

                           EUGENE
              Well save those tears.

     Jerome shrugs awkwardly and pours them both a drink.

                           JEROME
              You really had other offers?

                           EUGENE
                      (shrugs)
              I'm sure I could have.


     INT. CONDOMINIUM - INCINERATOR.  NIGHT.

     The naked JEROME scrapes away at his skin with even greater
     ferocity than usual.  After exiting the incinerator, he deposits
     all the incriminating trash he has collected during the day into
     the furnace and ignites the gas.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     From outside, a car horn sounds.  JEROME, in a formal suit and
     spectacles, abruptly enters the condominium.  He goes to a
     closet and starts searching through Eugene's clothes.

                           JEROME
              Mind if I borrow a tie?

     EUGENE is more interested in the car parked outside the
     condominium.  IRENE sits in a convertible Citroen DS, dressed in
     a classic but provocative black suit.  Unaware that she is being
     observed she touches up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.

                           EUGENE
              So it's not just the Hoovers who've got
              you rattled.

                           JEROME
              You're the one who said not to change anything.
              She's my ear to the investigation.

                           EUGENE
                      (skeptical)
              Is that all?

                           JEROME
              I've got enough on my mind without that.

                           EUGENE
              If you say so.
                      (referring to the ties in Jerome's hand)
              The stripe.

                           JEROME
                      (agreeing with the selection)
              Good choice.

     Jerome fumbles with the knot.  From his chair, Eugene knots
     Jerome's tie for him.  Jerome is intrigued that for once Eugene
     is abstaining - he has not touched his drink.

                           JEROME
              Not thirsty?
                      (referring to the fridge)
              We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.

                           EUGENE
              I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still
              drunk from last night.

                           JEROME
              Never stopped you before.
                      (regarding Eugene's head)
              And for God's sake stop plucking your hair.
              Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure
              you wouldn't go bald.

                           EUGENE
              If I were you I'd worry about myself.
                      (nodding to Jerome's spectacles)
              Haven't you forgotten something?

     Jerome pockets the spectacles and enters the bathroom for his
     contact lenses.  The horn sounds outside the window a second
     time and Jerome hastily exits.  We stay with Eugene.  Irene
     catches a glimpse of him before he moves away from the window.
     Jerome emerges from the building.

     As the couple drive away, Eugene wheels himself to the full
     length mirror.  He regards his own reflection for a moment and
     opens the mirror - a disguised door opening into the adjacent
     apartment.  A cloud of condensed water vapor billows out.
     GERMAN, the DNA Broker, emerges with an ENGINEER.

     He sends the engineer on his way and joins Eugene at his desk.
     Eugene hands German a credit card that he wipes through his
     computer.

                           GERMAN
              We still need to overhaul the back-up generator.
                      (fixing Eugene with a penetrating stare)
              What's going on, Eugene, I thought he was going
              away, not you--you going on vacation?

                           EUGENE
                      (looking away)
              You got it, German.

                           GERMAN
                      (nodding thoughtfully)
              You deserve it.


     INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and IRENE step over feet, apologizing as they go,
     eventually finding their seats in a box in a sold-out concert
     hall.

     On the stage below, a YOUNG PIANIST - a teenage prodigy - has
     already taken his place at the keys of a grand piano.  The
     pianist removes his white gloves and begins to play - an
     extremely complex and beautiful piece we have never heard
     before.  IRENE looks to JEROME.  He is clearly caught up in the
     music.


     EXT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.  NIGHT.

     The music from the piano recital continues under the following
     contrasting action.  A huge, brooding housing project.  PEOPLE
     hang around on street corners.  Menace in the air - a feeling of
     impending violence.

     Suddenly unmarked police cars appear from all directions,
     blocking any escape route.  Dozens of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES
     pour out of the cars and onto the street.

     People scatter, many running straight into the arms of the
     Detectives.  OTHERS, spilling out of the housing project, are
     also immediately apprehended.

     The Detectives quickly weed out those suspects not fitting
     Jerome's description - WOMEN, OLD MEN and TEENAGERS.  They are
     shepherded off the street.  A line of IN-VALIDS is formed
     several hundred yards long.  Detectives begin to laboriously
     move along the line, taking finger-prick blood samples from each
     suspect - instantly confirming their identities with portable
     analyzers worn on their hips.

     As if having the idea at the same time, TWO SEPARATE MEN
     suddenly bolt from the line, knowing that their blood will
     incriminate them.  Other Detectives, watching for such escape
     attempts, esaily apprehend them and escort them to a waiting
     police van.

     With the raid under control, DETECTIVE HUGO indicates to the
     INVESTIGATOR that it is safe to exit his car.  The Investigator
     appears irritated, only half-glancing at the TWO MEN already in
     custody, apparently certain that neither one is his suspect.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (enthusiastic)
              Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net.

     The Investigator clearly does not share Hugo's enthusiasm.  The
     Detective offers the Investigator an age enhanced photograph,
     computer-generated from the last existing photo of VINCENT as
     a 20-year-old.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              This is the age enhancement we're working with.

     The Investigator ignores the photo, preferring instead to trust
     his own eye as he wanders along the line of suspects.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (referring to the line-up)
              As you requested, we've kept the parameters
              wider than usual.

     The MEN they scrutinize are hardly mutants - the differences
     between an IN-VALID and a DAN are subtle at best.  Some shorter,
     some wearing glasses, some with receding hairlines or bald, many
     with no discernable physical difference at all.  The
     Investigator is only halfway down the line before he turns and
     starts walking back to his car.

     The mystified Detective Hugo follows his superior.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              This is the most likely location--

     The Investigator wheels on Hugo, suddenly angry, clearly unused
     to having his judgement questioned.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              --There's that word again.  I have a feeling
              This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not
              exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely"
              that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for
              fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come
              to us now like a lamb?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (taken aback by the outburst)
              Is there something more we should know about this
              suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid
              have shown up at the scene of four serious
              felonies.  Do you need any more than that?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent
              citizens have left specimens at as many crime
              scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              I don't like anybody this unlucky.
                      (pause)
              Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile
              radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier
              establishments.  Random car stops.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              We're already getting complaints about
              frivolous search.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              This is a murder investigation.  The public
              should be happy to co-operate, to get this
              disease off the streets.


     INT.  CONCERT HALL.  NIGHT.

     A standing ovation.  The YOUNG PIANIST on the stage bows deeply,
     soaking up the applause of the AUDIENCE.  The pianist tosses one
     of his white gloves into the front row where it is caught by an
     adoring FAN.  The second glove he tosses up to the box where
     JEROME and IRENE are standing.  Jerome snares the glove out of
     the air and immediately hands it to Irene.  She promptly slips
     the glove on her own hand.

     The glove fits snugly over her five fingers.  However one finger
     of the glove remains unfilled.  Jerome is stunned to realize
     that it is a six-fingered glove.

                           IRENE
                      (catching his look of astonishment)
              You didn't know?

                           JEROME
                      (trying hard to convince)
              Yes...yes...

                           IRENE
                      (picking up a resentment, confused)
              You're angry--

                           JEROME
              Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.

     He quickly turns away to lead the applause.  On stage, the
     pianist raises his hands to acknowledge the crowd.  Both his
     hands contain a perfectly formed extra finger.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - PROSTITUTE'S BOUDOIR.  NIGHT.

     From an upstairs window we observe the INVESTIGATOR's car
     cruise slowly back into the squalid housing project.  A MAN is
     buckling his pants at the window.

                           JOHN
              Shit!  One of those Hoovers is back.

     A prostitute, VALERIE, a slender, sylphlike beauty, joins him at
     the window.

                           VALERIE
              It's alright.  He's here to see me.

     Her client looks at her askance.  Despite her assurances, he
     hurries into his clothes anyway.

                           VALERIE
                      (to an unseen woman in the next room)
              Sonja, I can't see anyone else tonight.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - PROSTITUTE'S BOUDOIR.  NIGHT.

     The INVESTIGATOR, sits up in the bed, glass in his hand.
     VALERIE lies on the tangled sheets, naked, making no effort to
     cover herself.  She regards the Investigator curiously.

                           VALERIE
              I don't understand you, Investigator.

     The Investigator glances idly in her direction.

                           VALERIE
                      (teasing good-naturedly)
              You hunt us by day and fuck us by night.  Do
              you only get it up for In-valids?

     The Investigator smiles and rejoins her on the bed.

                           VALERIE
              Wouldn't you be happier with one of your
              made-to-order whores?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (gently stroking her hair)
              You are so beautiful, are you sure you weren't
              altered?  This is not the face, the body, of
              a Godchild.  How could something so lovely
              be a product of chance?

                           VALERIE
              Is that what keeps you coming back?
                      (meeting his gaze)
              Look at you.  Such angry, beautiful, perfect eyes.
              Do you ever wonder what they would see if they
              weren't quite so perfect?  They will never see
              what I see.

     The Investigator tries to laugh off her assertion but his
     tight-lipped smile betrays his displeasure.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (a cruel edge to his voice)
              You have so much wrong with you, you'll
              be lucky to see next year.

     He roughly forces himself on top of her but she remains defiant.

                           VALERIE
              Are you so much more alive, Investigator?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (parting her legs)
              I'm not paying you to talk.


     INT/EXT.  IRENE'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     IRENE drives, JEROME at her side.  Cars are being flagged down
     by uniformed POLICE OFFICERS.  Irene slows down behind the car
     in front.  Spying an OFFICER shine a flashlight in the eyes of
     the MALE DRIVER up ahead, Jerome wipes the contact lenses from
     his eyes and flicks them out of the passenger window when Irene
     is not looking.

     An OFFICER approaches Jerome and, without a word, opens an
     electronic testing kit worn on his hip.  He removes a sterilized
     Q-tip and motions for Jerome to open his mouth so he can scrape
     a culture.  Jerome waves his hand in front of his mouth,
     feigning embarrassment.

                           JEROME
                      (conspiratorial)
              Better not.
                      (nodding in Irene's direction)
              Don't want to give you a contaminated
              specimen...if you get my meaning.

     IRENE plays along, shrugging coyly at the cop.

     We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of Jerome's hand as he furtively
     retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff.  With the
     hair already in his fingers, he pretends to pluck a hair from
     his head, faking a wince at the appropriate moment.

     The cop, wearing transparent latex gloves, takes the follicle
     and places it in a receptacle in his kit.  After a short moment
     the hair confirms JEROME's driving ID which appears on the kit's
     electronic screen.  As the cop departs, Irene looks
     questioningly at Jerome.

                           JEROME
              Thanks.
                      (answering her unasked question)
              You never know where those swabs have been.

     Irene nods, however clearly not convinced.  She shakes the doubt
     from her mind.

                           IRENE
              I want to show you something.

     She accelerates away.  We see the road ahead from Jerome's POV.
     Without his contact lenses, it is a blur.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB.  NIGHT.

     After closing time, suited DETECTIVES vacuum the club in which
     Jerome and Eugene dined the previous evening.  MICHAEL, the
     owner, looks on disdainfully.  Waiting in the background, the
     regular CLEANERS - most likely In-valids themselves - smirk to
     each other, enjoying watching the cops do their work for them.


     EXT.  OCEAN HIGHWAY.  NIGHT.

     With no place to turn the car around, IRENE parks on the cliff
     side of the six-lane highway.  In the darkness she dashes from
     the car and, without a second thought, runs directly out into
     the heavy commuter traffic.  Easily negotiating the on-coming
     cars, she emerges safely on the other side of the highway.

     JEROME, rounding the car from the passenger side, is about to
     follow, when he suddenly pulls up sharply at the curb.  We focus
     on his eyes, deprived of the benefit of their contact lenses.
     From Jerome's POV, we see that the headlights rushing towards
     him are nothing but a series of fast-moving blurs - blurs that
     merge together.  He is unable to distinguish between the
     vehicles or judge their distance.

                           IRENE
                      (calling back urgently from the
                      other side, mindful of the light
                      beginning to leak into the sky)
              Come on!  We'll miss it!

     Irene stares expectantly back at Jerome with her 20/20 vision,
     unaware of his predicament.  Jerome puts a foot off the curb at
     the wrong moment and is almost collected by an on-coming car.
     Irene is taken-aback at his mistiming.  Does she detect a squint
     on Jerome's face?  To Jerome, the figure of Irene on the other
     side of the highway is merely a featureless shape but he feels
     her expectation.  He touches the spectacles, still in his
     pocket, but they are an unthinkable option.

     He shakes the idea from his head and turns back to the swiftly-
     flowing highway.  He makes up his mind - he cannot allow himself
     to be shamed, even at the risk of life and limb.  Hardly even
     glancing at the traffic, he suddenly bolts blindly across the
     road.  Headlights hurtling towards him, cars fortuitously
     brushing past his heels, horns blaring.  Jerome makes a final
     leap to the haven of the far curb, the rush of air from a large,
     fast-moving truck blowing him the final inches to the sidewalk.

     Irene is stunned by the near miss.  She is about to comment but
     Jerome takes her by the arm and ushers her towards the dunes.

                           JEROME
              Come on.  We'll miss it.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DAWN.

     JEROME and IRENE huddle beneath an overcoat as the sun crests
     the horizon, staining the sky with an ochre blush.

                           IRENE
              What did I tell you?

     Jerome nods.  However, to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing
     but an out-of-focus, abstract ink blot.

                           IRENE
              I envy you, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              You'll be next.

                           IRENE
              I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make
              in space is around the sun--
                      (letting a handful of sand
                      slip through her fingers)
              --on this satellite right here.

     Irene turns to Jerome.

                           IRENE
                      (blurting out what's really on her mind)
              --Listen, I don't want to waste your time
              and I really don't want you to waste mine.
              I don't know what you're after but I have
              a feeling I'm not it.

     Irene suddenly takes Jerome's hand and puts it up her
     sweater, onto her breast.  Although taken aback, Jerome makes
     no effort to withdraw his hand.

                           IRENE
                      (enjoying his unease)
              It's here.  My heart.
                      (adding quickly)
              I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a
              drug maintenance program, blood thinners,
              diet--
                      (slowly removing his hand)
              I just want you to know what you'd be getting
              yourself into.

                           JEROME
              What exactly is wrong?

                           IRENE
              Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing
              symptoms in my late-fifties.
                      (matter-of-fact)
              But unless they come up with something between
              now and then, I won't live much past 67.

     Jerome's mouth drops a little, betraying his surprise at the
     statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties.

                           IRENE
              Of course I think about it every day.

                           JEROME
                      (still not quite recovered from his surprise)
              Of course.


     INT.  POOL.  MORNING.

     The INVESTIGATOR swims his race with the unseen opponent.  The
     Investigator's ASSISTANT, carrying a phone, tries to attract his
     attention.


     EXT.  JEROME'S POOL.  MORNING.

     JEROME sits at his own poolside in his robe, feet dangling over
     the edge, smoking a cigarette.  EUGENE, from his wheelchair, is
     applying bleach to Jerome's hair and eyebrows with gloved
     hands.

     At the same time, Jerome plays a sleight-of-hand game with a
     syringe.

                           EUGENE
              How was your evening?

                           JEROME
              Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.

                           EUGENE
                      (teasing)
              You are a catch.  No doubt she's worried that
              she would lower the standard of your offspring.
              Everybody wants to "breed up".
                      (idly curious)
              What's wrong with her?

                           JEROME
                      (trying to be blasÈ)
              You know how it is with these altered births
              --somebody told her she's not going to live
              forever and she's been preparing to die ever
              since.

                           EUGENE
              You're not thinking of telling her, are you?

                           JEROME
              Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.

                           EUGENE
                      (adamant)
              She doesn't have to know.  She doesn't want to know.

     The camera travels down Jerome's scarred legs to find that the
     pool is completely drained.  We now realize that it never
     contained water.


     A BARREN WASTELAND.

     A desolate landscape, resembling the surface of the planet Mars.
     We pull back to find that we are peering at this forbidding
     desert through a circular aperture.


     INT.  CRIME LAB.  DAY.

     The INVESTIGATOR lifts his head from the eyepiece of an
     electron microscope through which he has been examining a tiny
     fragment of skin - the skin is identified as belonging to 20-
     YEAR-OLD VINCENT.  DETECTIVE HUGO stands at the Investigator's
     side - his attitude more respectful in light of the discovery.

     Detective Hugo points out a location on a computer-generated
     map.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (chagrined)
              The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant.
              The employees are all accounted for.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (shifting the view of the map
                      to include the Gattaca complex)
              No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have
              shown up there in the past.

     The Investigator understands the significance.  They wander over
     to a blow-up photograph of the 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              We have to consider the possibility that he's
              playing somebody else's hand.

     A smile gradually broadens across the Investigator's face.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (taking a perverse pleasure in the
                      slowly dawning revelation)
              Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".
                      (glancing to a photo of the
                      Gattaca crime scene)
              He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find
              the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to
              take a leak during a murder.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (quickly covering himself)
              It's still possible the eyelash specimen came
              from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown
              in through an open window.

     The Investigator appears not to be listening, his mind made up.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (mind racing)
              He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (puzzled)
              It is hard to believe he could be one of
              their elite workers.  You've seen their
              security system.  They know who works there.
                      (referring to 20-year-old Vincent's profile)
              Even if you ignore the man's expiration date,
              his profile suggests that he doesn't have the
              mathematical propensity let alone the stamina
              to pass their physicals.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Don't underestimate these imposters.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (skeptical, referring to a file of
                      Gattaca employee ID photos)
              None of the ID photos match the enhancement.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (smiling to himself)
              A man can change his face--but blood is forever.
              Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.
                      (pause)
              Intravenous.

     Hugo's mouth drops open at the mention of "intravenous".

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (immediately protesting)
              You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at
              least fall into the category.  We'll be
              closing down their operation for days.
                      (seeking a compromise)
              At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shaking his head)
              Blood.  From the vein.

     The Investigator turns on his heel to prevent further protest.
     The Detective and his ASSISTANTS exchange looks of exasperation
     behind the Investigator's back.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME, drinking water, stands in front of a large video
     bulletin board.  Among other things, it displays the electronic
     mugshot of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT alongside the recent computer
     generated age enhancement of his face.

     Some distance away, CAESAR, the elderly janitor, discusses the
     mugshots with a YOUNGER JANITOR.

                           CAESAR
              Look like anybody to you?

                           YOUNGER JANITOR
              Not to me.

                           CAESAR
              Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he?

     Jerome half-smiles, realizing that the conversation is for his
     benefit.  Having made it clear that they do not intend to expose
     their former colleague, the two janitors continue their rounds.

     Jerome crushes his paper cup.  Forgetting himself, he
     drops the cup into the wastebasket.


     INT.  CRAFT.  DAY.

     JEROME familiarizes himself with the interior of a spacecraft
     under the supervision of DIRECTOR JOSEF and the MISSION
     COMMANDER.  The screen that Jerome sits at is identical to the
     one he operates in the computer complex - displaying asteroid
     951 Gaspra.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              --Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key.
                      (warming to his theme)
              Back to the beginning of the book--the life we
              became.  With the original building blocks who
              knows how far we can take "the godding".

                           MISSION COMMANDER
                      (wry smile)
              Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be
              last year's model by the time we're done.

                           JEROME
                      (smiling back)
              I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander.

     Irene enters the craft.

                           IRENE
              Excuse me, Mr Morrow.  The investigators have
              begun their testing.

                           DETECTIVE JOSEF
              This is so inconvenient, Irene.  They can
              make an exception for Jerome.

                           IRENE
              I'm afraid not.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              I apologize, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              It's not yor fault, Director.
                      (afterthought)
              If your predecessor were still around
              we may not be going to Gaspra at all.
              That's what I would call inconvenient.

     Jerome exits the craft with Irene.


     INT.  GATTACA CORPORATION - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

     A line of MALE GATTACA EMPLOYEES snakes out the door and down
     the corridor.  The INVESTIGATOR walks slowly down the line,
     trying to eyeball his suspect.  Concentrating on the shorter,
     dark-haired men in the line, he looks straight past JEROME.
     However, as the Investigator ignores him and walks by, we see a
     haunted look in Jerome's eyes.


     INT.  GATTACA - TESTING LAB.  DAY.

     Every available TECHNICIAN is working to accommodate the testing
     of the thousand or so PROGRAMMERS.  Twelve testing stations
     operate simultaneously.  A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE supervises each
     station.  JEROME reaches the head of the line.  He notes an
     exiting COLLEAGUE holding a cotton ball to his arm.

     A NURSE directs Jerome to LAMAR's testing station.  Lamar
     deposits the previous patient's labeled vial into a blood
     carousel under the watchful eye of a large DETECTIVE, clearly
     not relishing his assignment.  Jerome rolls up his sleeve.

                           JEROME
                      (referring to the table lined with syringes)
              What's with the plungers, Lamar?  What are
              you doing, opening a blood bank?

     The syringes are clearly not Lamar's idea.

                           LAMAR
                      (sarcastic)
              The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that
              my testing methods may have been compromised.

     Lamar inserts a fresh syringe into Jerome's arm.  As Lamar draws
     the blood, Jerome suddenly flinches and flexes his arm
     violently, causing the needle to bend and buckle, exiting the
     skin from a second puncture point.

                           JEROME
              Damn!!

     Having pulled away from Lamar's grasp, Jerome withdraws the bent
     needle himself, blood still squirting from his vein.

                           LAMAR
                      (grabbing a nearby wad of gauze)
              Jesus--I'm sorry, Jerome.

     The large Homicide Detective winces and turns away from the red
     arcing spray, a splash of blood spattering his shoes.  In the
     midst of the commotion, with his practised sleight-of-hand,
     Jerome removes the vial from the syringe and replaces it with
     another concealed vial.

                           JEROME
                      (unfazed, putting Lamar at his ease)
              You must be out of practise, Lamar.

     Lamar hurriedly takes the syringe from Jerome.

                           LAMAR
                      (examining and removing the
                      switched vial from the bent syringe)
              I've got enough here.

                           JEROME
                      (regarding the squimish detective,
                      as he holds the gauze to his arm)
              Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.

     The Detective notices the spatter of blood across his brogues
     and, with a look of disdain, wipes it clean.  He tosses the
     incriminating tissue down a hygenically sealed garbage shoot.

     Lamar places Jerome's labelled vial in the carousel where it is
     immediately analyzed by the computer.  Jerome's "legitimate"
     Employee ID code appears on the screen - "VALID".  Another
     EMPLOYEE enters the testing lab.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME exits the testing lab with the gauze held to his arm.
     IRENE is standing outside the door.

                           IRENE
              So you didn't do it after all.

                           JEROME
                      (joking darkly)
              I guess somebody beat me to it.


     INT.  GATTACA - MEZZANINE FLOOR.  LATER IN THE DAY.

     From above, the INVESTIGATOR and HUGO observe the final EMPLOYEE
     exit the testing lab.

     LAMAR, following the employee out of the lab, throws a look of
     vindication to the two cops.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              That's the last.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Something's not right.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (losing his patience)
              He's not here.  It's a blind alley.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (resolute)
              No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              We don't have the manpower.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Get it.  From outside, if you have to.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              From what budget?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (angered by Hugo's excuses)
              I'll take it out of your damn pension if
              you question my authority one more time!

     The INVESTIGATOR turns his back on his subordinate and idly
     contemplates the nearby telescope.  Hugo resignedly relays the
     news to Director Josef who is standing some distance away.
     Josef's immediate reaction is to march towards the Investigator,
     Hugo trailing behind.  DIRECTOR JOSEF collects himself as he
     notices the Investigator's hand on the telescope.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              Would you care to look--in the telescope?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Thank you, no.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (still referring to the telescope)
              One look through there and you would know why
              I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations
              any further.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (unfazed)
              You're so unconcerned that you have a killer
              in your midst.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              Right now, your presence is creating more of
              a threat.  I don't think you have any concept
              of what we do here--how meticulous our
              preparations must be.  We are about to send
              twelve people through 140 million miles of
              blackness to rendezvous with an object the size
              of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather
              critical to point them in the right direction.
              And we certainly don't need you looking over our
              shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is
              any evidence that the killer is amongst us.  I
              don't see too many other dead bodies littering
              the place.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (surveying the mostly empty facility)
              No, but since there aren't too many live ones
              tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one
              further sweep.  If he does not work here, then
              there should be no other trace of him.
                      (to Hugo)
              I think you'd better get some people out of bed,
              Detective.
                      (a thought occurs)
              In the meantime we can re-check his favorite
              haunt.

     Director Josef quietly seethes.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to Josef, referring to the telescope)
              You see, Director, I prefer my microscope.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     JEROME readies himself for an evening out - a bandage around his
     arm from the needle puncture.  EUGENE wheels himself in.

                           EUGENE
              Where are we going?

                           JEROME
                      (slightly guilty)
              I'm sorry.  I've got plans.

                           EUGENE
                      (feigning hurt)
              Again?

                           JEROME
                      (referring to his bandage)
              She's already got her doubts.  I have to act
              like nothing's wrong.

                           EUGENE
              I'm sure you'll be very convincing.

     Jerome ignores the remark.

                           EUGENE
              Where are you taking her?

                           JEROME
              Michael's.

     Eugene looks at him askance.

                           JEROME
              Everybody goes there.

                           EUGENE
                      (incredulous, glancing around the room)
              You may as well invite her here.

                           JEROME
                      (afterthought as he picks up his jacket)
              Will you be okay?

                           EUGENE
              Don't worry about your little pin cushion.
              To be honest, I'm looking forward to having
              the place to myself.

                           JEROME
                      (seeing through the bravado)
              We'll still be able to talk when I'm away.
              The conversation will just keep getting longer.

                           EUGENE
              How long?

                           JEROME
              By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and
              say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes
              later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"

                           EUGENE
              I guess I'd better have something important
              to say if it takes that long to get an answer.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB.  NIGHT.

     IRENE and JEROME step off the dance floor of the smoky, decadent
     dinner club and take a seat at their table.  Irene is agog at
     the strange assortment of PATRONS, the cigars, the laden dessert
     trolleys.  It is all slightly off from the pristine world she is
     accustomed to.

                           IRENE
              What is this place?

                           JEROME
                      (wry smile, enjoying her fascination)
              You've never been here?
                      (a dessert trolley is wheeled up)
              Let me order for you.

     Jerome selects a chocolate torte from the trolley.  Jerome
     savors a spoonful.  Irene is tempted but then remembers herself.

                           IRENE
              I'd better not.

     She reaches for her elegant pill box.  Jerome takes another
     spoonful.

                           JEROME
              So sure of what you can't do.  Do you even
              know what it tastes like, Irene?

     Irene goes to deny it but cannot.

     MICHAEL suddenly approaches the table with a WAITER in tow.
     Irene is about to steal a taste of the dessert with her finger
     when their plates and glasses are whisked away and the table
     immediately hoovered.  Michael whispers in Jerome's ear.

                           MICHAEL
              Take the side door.

     Jerome looks up in time to see DETECTIVE HUGO coming through the
     front entrance with several other DETECTIVES.

                           DETECTIVE
                      (to his colleagues)
              Check for lenses, hairpieces--

     A Detective shines a flashlight in the eyes of a MALE PATRON.
     A SECOND DETECTIVE tugs the hair of a SECOND PATRON.  Jerome
     takes Irene by the hand and escorts her out of the side exit.
     Several other COUPLES make for the parking lot.

                           IRENE
              Why are we leaving?

                           JEROME
                      (attempting to explain the hasty exit)
              Those checks take forever.


     EXT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB - SIDE ALLEY.  NIGHT.

     Spilling out of the exit, JEROME and IRENE find a burly
     plain clothes DETECTIVE barring their way.  Before the Detective
     can say a word, Jerome has wrapped his fist in his jacket sleeve
     and smashed him in the face.  He continues to beat the Detective
     until he lies motionless on the ground.

                           IRENE
                      (stunned)
              Jerome!

     Spying other Detectives some distance away in the parking lot.
     Jerome leads Irene out of a hidden side gate.

                           IRENE
              What about the car?

                           JEROME
                      (grabbing her by the hand)
              Let's walk.

                           IRENE
              Who are they?

                           JEROME
                      (holding his bruised knuckles)
              It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.

     Jerome drags Irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by
     moonlight.  Feeling exposed, he breaks into a run.

                           IRENE
              I can't.

                           JEROME
                      (anxious)
              Come on.

                           IRENE
              My medication.  I left it back there.

                           JEROME
              We'll get it later.
                      (forcing her to look him in the eye)
              Irene, please.

     Irene realizes his seriousness.  She begins to run with him.
     The clearing is wider than Jerome anticipated.  They are only
     halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the Detective think yo
     look in their direction.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S.  NIGHT.

     The INVESTIGATOR is grilling MICHAEL, the club's owner.  The
     investigator suspiciously regards the multitude of mini-vacs in
     the kitchen and the incinerator burning the refuse.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (an accusing tone)
              You run a clean establishment.

                           MICHAEL
              Are you a health inspector?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (showing Vincent's mugshot)
              Do you recognize this man?

                           MICHAEL
              My eyes aren't so good.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              I bet.

     Hugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered
     his fallen colleague.

                           HUGO
              Sir.

     The Investigator hurries to him.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to the still dazed Detective,
                      examining his injuries)
              Did he hit you with his fist?

                           DETECTIVE
                      (head in his hands)
              More like a hammer.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (reprimanding the beaten Detective)
              Don't touch your face.  Don't swallow.
              Don't spit.
                      (to Hugo)
              Quick, clean his teeth.

     Hugo uses a flashlight and a small dental-like implement to try
     to pick skin from Jerome's knuckles from between the Detective's
     teeth.  The Investigator finds the hidden side door.


     EXT.  DESOLATE LOT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and IRENE continue to sprint across the enormous vacant
     lot in the moonlight, splashing through deposits of mud and
     water.  Just as the gate opens in the distance, Jerome hurls
     Irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side.
     Irene, out of breath, desperately feels for her pulse.

                           IRENE
                      (upset, a strangled protest)
              Are you trying to kill me?  Are you?!
              Don't you understand, I can't do that!

     Jerome tenderly removes Irene's hand from her pulse.

                           JEROME
              You just did.

     Irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just
     negotiated, realizing what she has just done.

     From across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing
     cry from the center FIGURE.

                           INVESTIGATOR (OC)
              Vincent!  Vincent!


     EXT.  MICHAEL'S.  NIGHT.

     The INVESTIGATOR is about to cry out Vincent's name once again
     when he realizes DETECTIVE HUGO and the other DETECTIVES are
     watching him, askance.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to Hugo, covering his frustration)
              What are you waiting for?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Where do we start?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.

                           DETECTIVE
                      (handing the Investigator Irene's pill box)
              We caught them trying to flush these, Sir.

     The Investigator carefully examines the heart pills.


     EXT.  IRENE'S APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME walks IRENE to the steps of her apartment.  Jerome thinks
     about departing but Irene takes him gently by the hand.

                           IRENE
              So sure of what you can't do.

     Jerome follows her inside.


     INT.  IRENE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and IRENE climb a staircase to her bedroom.  Without
     another word they begin to make love.

     LATER THAT NIGHT, JEROME cannot sleep.  He rises quietly so as
     not to disturb IRENE.  He silently opens the double-windows of
     the upstairs bedroom.  He carefully gathers his pillow from the
     bed and shakes it out of the window.

     Slowly Jerome turns to gaze at the wood floor.  In the moonlight
     we see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a single hair lying on the
     floorboards.  Jerome bends and picks up the hair, trying to
     identify it in the dim light.  On his hands and knees he tries
     to clean the floor with a towel.  Irene turns over in the
     bed.  Jerome freezes but she continues to sleep.  He realizes he
     may be spreading even more of his skin and hair over the floor.
     Overcome with frustration and the enormity of his task, he
     begins to quietly weep.


     EXT.  A FIELD.  DAWN.

     A light shroud of mist hangs over the trees that encircle a
     grassy clearing beyond Irene's building.  Something lies in the
     center of the clearing.

     We jump-cut to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of two or three blades of
     grass.  Bristles rain down on the blades.  Withotu access to his
     incinerator, the crouched, naked figure of JEROME disposes of
     his whiskers, skin and hair in an open field.  His clothes sit
     in a neat pile at his side.  He pours glycolic acid over his
     body and scrubs at his back, feet and hands with a brush.  There
     is a haunted, tortured look in his eyes as he tries desperately
     to rid himself of himself.


     INT.  POOL.  MORNING.

     The INVESTIGATOR swims obsessively in his aquatic treadmill.


     INT.  IRENE'S APARTMENT.  LATER THAT MORNING.

     Back in the bedroom, JEROME, partially dressed, holds IRENE
     in bed.  She softly touches the scars on his shins.

                           IRENE
                      (referring to the shins)
              What happened?

                           JEROME
              You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?
              It's the exact height of the front fender.
                      (shrugs)
              Looked right instead of left.

                           IRENE
                      (comforted by the thought)
              So you're not so smart after all.
                      (awkward about raising the subject)
              I want you to know--if it ever came to it--
              I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg
              Bank.  In fact, I'd rather use a donor egg--
                      (quickly covering herself again)
              --if it came to it.

                           JEROME
              But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--
                      (searching for an appropriate body part)
              --nose.
                      (stroking her face)
              How perfect does your child have to be?

                           IRENE
                      (mildly irritated by what she
                      perceives as his mocking)
              You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment
              you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't
              for who you are--what you are?  Don't you get
              any satisfaction knowing that your children
              will be able to live to a ripe old age unless
              they do something foolish?

                           JEROME
              That's precisely what scaresme--that they
              won't do anything foolish or courageous or
              anything--worth a Goddamn.

     Irene is taken aback by Jerome's passion, regarding him in a new
     light.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  MORNING.

     EUGENE urinates into a large plastic container while drinking
     bottled water at the same time.  He already has several other
     containers of urine on the table beside him.


     INT.  GATTACA.  MORNING.

     The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO keep a wary eye on the
     outfitted DETECTIVES re-vacuuming the empty computer complex
     with their mini-vacs.

                           HUGO
                      (reading newspaper)
              My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shrugs, ambivalent)
              Why not?

                           HUGO
              These new personality corrections I've been
              reading about.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              You worried about the cost?

                           HUGO
              Not that.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (regarding Hugo with a condescending smile)
              They said the same thing about myopia and
              obesity.  You think your children would be
              less human if they were less violent, angry,
              spiteful?  Maybe they'd be more human.  From
              where I sit the world could stand a little
              improving.

     We dwell on one DETECTIVE in particular, snatching a garbage
     bag from CAESAR, the janitor.

                           DETECTIVE
              Don't touch that.  It's evidence.

     He puts a pile of discarded paper cups aside for later testing.


     INT.  GATTACA CORPORATION.  LATER THAT MORNING.

     In the vast, empty Gattaca complex the INVESTIGATOR inspects a
     specimen bag containing Jerome's paper cup with DIRECTOR JOSEF
     and DETECTIVE HUGO.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Positive saliva match.  The cup was
              definitely used since the original sweep.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              So we have two choices.  Either our suspect
              came back to the murder scene for a drink of
              water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...
                      (looking out over the empty complex)
              ...he is here.
                      (resolute)
              We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a
              desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that
              night--perhaps their place in line.
                      (to Director Josef)
              I'd like the profiles of everyone with an
              upcoming mission.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (nervous)
              Twelve have a mission within the week.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              This time I will supervise each test personally.


     INT/EXT.  GATTACA.  MORNING.

     JEROME and IRENE walk towards the entrance to Gattaca.  Spying
     the Homicide Investigation trucks parked at the rear of the
     building and the silhouette of the INVESTIGATOR in the doorway,
     Jerome pulls up sharply.  Irene notices his unease.

                           IRENE
              What is it?

                           JEROME
              I forgot something--something at home.
              I'll see you later.

     Jerome kisses her.  Irene, also aware of the trucks,
     interrogates Jerome with her eyes.

                           IRENE
              I'll miss you.

     Jerome is still focussed on the entranceway.

                           IRENE
                      (looking skywards)
              --when you go away.

                           JEROME
              We could go together one day.

     Irene considers the idea.  She enters Gattaca alone.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     IRENE prepares a stack of ID photos of CREW MEMBERS for the
     INVESTIGATOR.  She closely inspects the doctored photo of
     JEROME, hesitating before adding it to the file.

     The camera dwells on JEROME's vacant work station.  The
     INVESTIGATOR curiously regards the empty chair.  He is
     accompanied by DETECTIVE HUGO, DIRECTOR JOSEF and IRENE.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              He's the only absentee.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              A little nausea.  Quite common.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              At least it's nothing contagious.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (unduly agitated)
              I will not permit any further testing on the
              eve of a mission.  We're already counting
              backwards.

     The INVESTIGATOR ignores Josef and takes a pocket knife from his
     jacket.  He prises out the "ESC" key from Jerome's keyboard,
     places the key in a specimen bag and deposits it in his jacket.

                           IRENE
                      (picking up a phone)
              I'll call and let him know.

     The Investigator gently but firmly removes the phone from
     Irene's hand and replaces the receiver in the cradle.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Let's not spoil the surprise.
                      (to Irene)
              I understand you can show us the way.

     The anxious Director Josef calls out to protest one further
     time but the Investigator is on his way out of the door.


     EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE GATTACA.  DAY.

     Outside the entrance to Gattaca, trying to hail a taxi, JEROME
     is startled to see a car carrying the INVESTIGATOR, DETECTIVE
     HUGO and IRENE roar out of the driveway.  JEROME calls on his
     portable wristphone.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     EUGENE, at his window, filling sachets as usual, hesitates
     before answering the phone.

                           EUGENE
              Hello?

                           JEROME (OC)
              How would you like to be yourself for the day?

                           EUGENE
                      (nonchalant)
              I was never very good at it, remember?


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM / HALLWAY.  DAY.

     With a look of resolve, EUGENE hangs up the phone.

     He wheels his chair up to the sweeping staircase and regards the
     first of many dozen steps.  The daunting staircase spirals away
     above him.


     INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S CAR.  DAY.

     HUGO drives.  The INVESTIGATOR looks to IRENE in the rear seat.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (taunting)
              You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?

     He hands her the pill box found in Michael's.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              You think you have problems?


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDO/JEROME'S CONDO.  DAY.

     Having wheeled his chair out of sight, EUGENE eases himself out
     of his wheelchair and onto the floor.  Using his elbows,
     commando-style, dragging his lifeless legs behind him, he
     proceeds to crawl across the floor and up the first step of the
     long spiral staircase.  We observe his agonizingly slow progress
     up a staircase that, from Eugene's point of view, appears to
     have doubled in length.


     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  DAY.

     The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO emerge from their car with
     IRENE in tow.  They take in the impressive complex - the
     Investigator gets a glimpse of the empty pool.  They approach
     the intercom at the entrance.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     EUGENE, bathed in sweat, finally crests the landing of the
     staircase.  No respite.  As he drags himself across the floor
     the internal phone rings.  He frantically stretches up and
     knocks the phone off its hook so he can talk from his prone
     position on the floor.


     INT.  CONDOMINIUM - LOBBY.  DAY.

     IRENE is on the phone, closely watched by the INVESTIGATOR and
     DETECTIVE HUGO.

                           EUGENE (OC)
                      (through intercom, no trace of his distress)
              Hello.

                           IRENE
                      (a moment's hesitation)
              Jerome--?

                           EUGENE
              Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     With no mean effort, EUGENE finally manages to replace the phone
     on its cradle.  He desperately crawls up onto the sofa.
     However, spying the upright vacuum cleaner in the open closet,
     he is forced to crawl there and remove the vacuum bag.  He
     frantically crawls back towards the sofa and stuffs the bag
     behind a cushion.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     IRENE enters the door deliberately left ajar, closely followed
     by the INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO.  EUGENE is propped up on
     the sofa, TV remote control placed in his useless hand to cover
     his paralysis.  He has a stainless steel bowl next to him and
     has crossed his lifeless legs for a more natural effect.  Eugene
     calmy motions the confused Irene towards him.

                           EUGENE
              Where's my kiss?

     The Investigator scrutinizes Irene's reaction.  With only the
     merest hesitation she takes her cue from Eugene and kisses
     him affectionately on the forehead.  She perches herself on the
     arm of the sofa.  Eugene takes the opportunity to rest his
     arm on her leg.

                           IRENE
              Good to see you're feeling better.

                           EUGENE
              Now you're here.  Who are your "friends"?

                           IRENE
              It's about the Director.

                           EUGENE
                      (feigning boredom)
              Again?

     The Investigator slowly circles Eugene, regarding him with the
     utmost scrutiny.  He compares his face to the doctored Gattaca
     ID photo - a passable likeness.  Eugene bends towards the bowl
     and dry retches.

                           EUGENE
              Forgive me for not getting up.

     Irene puts a comforting hand on Eugene's shoulder.

                           IRENE
                      (to the Investigator)
              Couldn't we do this another time?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              I don't believe so.

     Detective Hugo takes a seat in the chair beside the sofa and
     unpacks a syringe from the kit he carries.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              This won't take a moment.

     Detective Hugo swabs Eugene's inner arm.  All eyes are trained
     on the tip of the needle as it punctures the vein.

                           EUGENE
                      (reassuring to Irene, referring to
                      the blood flowing into the syringe)
              It's okay.  Maybe they can find out what I've got.

     Under the Investigator's watchful eye, Detective Hugo withdraws
     the syringe and immediately inserts a small amount of the blood
     into the portable analyzer he wears.  Naturally, it confirms
     that Eugene is Jerome.

     Irene does her best to conceal her shock.  Hiding his
     frustration, the Investigator distractedly tours the room while
     Hugo packs up his gear.  The Investigator idly toys with
     the telescope pointed out of the window.

     Next he wanders towards the closet and reaches for the doorknob.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Mind if I take a leak?

                           EUGENE
              As long as you don't do it in my closet.
                      (nodding to the other side of the room)
              Over there.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM - BATHROOM.  DAY.

     The INVESTIGATOR immediately pulls a specimen bag from his
     jacket pocket and closely inspects the stainless steel toilet
     and sink.  They are both spotless.  The shower stall is also
     scrupulously clean.  He flushes the toilet and exits.

     Lost in thought, the INVESTIGATOR approaches the closet again
     and wheels out Jerome's upright vacuum cleaner.  He is
     disappointed a second time to find no vacuum bag inside.  The
     Investigator returns the vacuum cleaner to the closet and
     produces a mini-vac from Detective Hugo's crime bag.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to Eugene, referring to ther mini-vac)
              May I?

                           EUGENE
              Clean the whole house if you want.

                           IRENE
                      (taking Eugene's lead)
              Actually, the kitchen needs doing.

     The Investigator switches on the mini-vac to take a specimen
     from the floor, then promptly kills the machine.  Looking down,
     the Investigator notices the trail of Eugene's perspiration
     on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase.

     Eugene, reading the Investigator's mind, goes to call out but
     the words remain frozen on his tongue.  Hugo follows his
     superior as they start to descend the stairs.  Irene and Eugene
     are left staring at one another.


     INT.  CONDO - STAIRCASE.  DAY.

     JEROME catches the merest glimpse of the INVESTIGATOR and
     DETECTIVE HUGO before he slips behind a doorway in Eugene's
     condominium.

     Jerome anxiously regards Eugene's empty wheelchair sitting
     there.  On the stairs, Hugo's phone rings.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO (OC)
                      (into phone, increasingly encouraged)
              Yes?...Yes...yes...

     The Investigator is already at the foot of the stairs in
     Eugene's condo when the Detective calls to him.

                           DETECTIVE
                      (urgent, to Investigator)
              Come quickly.  We have him.

     The Investigator's eyes light up.  He retraces his steps
     up the staircase after Detective Hugo.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     JEROME, white as a ghost, climbs the stairs, emerging into his
     own condominium.  He embraces the beaming EUGENE, still sitting
     on the sofa.

                           JEROME
                      (numb)
              How are you, Jerome?

                           EUGENE
              Not bad, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              How the hell did you get here.

                           EUGENE
                      (deadpan)
              I could always walk.  I've been faking it.

     Jerome almost laughs, despite the situation.  Only now does he
     notice Irene on the other side of the room, her mind racing.
     She looks at Jerome and Eugene together and runs from the
     apartment.

                           JEROME
                      (calling after her)
              Irene.

     Jerome goes to follow but Eugene stops him.


     INT.  CRIME LABORATORY.  DAY.

     An EXTREME CLOSE UP of dried blood - brittle and cracking - on
     a pair of soiled latex gloves.  A latex head mask, suit of
     clothes and shoe covers are similarly caked.  The INVESTIGATOR
     and DETECTIVE HUGO watch as a white-coated FORENSIC TECHNICIAN
     feeds a minute sample of the dried blood into an analyzer.

     The INVESTIGATOR wanders over to a one-way glass window through
     which he can observe DIRECTOR JOSEF, sitting numb but strangely
     serene in an interrogation room.  The Investigator, in a state
     of shock himself, cannot yet bring himself to believe what is
     plainly obvious.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (gazing at the Director, struggling
                      to come to grips with the turn of events)
              This can't be him.

     The Detective regards his superior incredulously, intrigued that
     he could still cling so stubbornly to his theory in the face of
     such overwhelming evidence.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (intrigued)
              We found his spit in the dead director's eye.
              He's signed a confession--supplied us with the
              suit he wore on the night.  What more do you
              want?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (a trace of desperation, grasping at straws)
              Luca could still be an accomplice.

     The Investigator turns away, unwilling or unable to accept the
     explanation.  Hugo regards the Investigator with a trace of
     sympathy.  He furtively retrieves the Investigator's tissue
     from the trash.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME sits in a formal briefing room with the other CREW
     MEMBERS of his mission, receiving their final pre-flight
     instructions.  LAMAR looks on approvingly.

                           MISSION COMMANDER
              --Finally, I'd like to welcome Navigator Morrow
              on his debut mission--if we get lost out there,
              nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like
              Jerome.

     Jerome looks up bashfully.

                           MISSION COMMANDER
                      (adopting a more serious tone)
              I'm gratified that there is no longer a cloud
              hanging over tomorrow's launch.  Now we can put
              this unpleasantness behind us and concentrate
              on the task at hand.  I don't have to tell you how
              important this mission is--the Belt could hold
              the key to the origin of life - why we are what
              we are.
                      (injecting a note of levity)
              I know many of you have been asking that
              question about me for long enough.
                      (referring to a projected photograph
                      of a misshapen asteroid behind his head)
              Gaspra--how could something so ugly hold so
              many beautiful secrets?

     Polite smiles from his colleagues.

                           MISSION COMMANDER
              Enjoy your final evening with your families.
              We'll all be a year older when they see
              us next.  And don't be late tomorrow.  You
              don't want to miss this.

     We focus on Jerome.  He appears to have his head in the heavens
     already.


     INT.  CRIME LAB.  NIGHT.

     The tormented INVESTIGATOR lies on the floor of his lab, staring
     at the ceiling.  he winces in discomfort.  He is lying on
     something.  He rolls over and retrieves the irritation from his
     pocket.  It is the "ESC" computer key he prized from Jerome's
     keyboard.

     He gazes at the key for a moment and then gets to his feet.  He
     resurrects an old fingerprint kit from a cupboard.  Carefully
     removing the key from the specimen bag - marked, "MORROW,
     Jerome" - he begins to dust it for a fingerprint.

     He places the key under a camera.  The enlarged print appears
     on the lefthand side of his computer screen.  The word "MATCH"
     blinks onto the screen.  However the face that appears from the
     computer's databank is not that of "MORROW, Jerome" but
     "LUCA, Vincent".  The Investigator regards the photograph in
     disbelief.

     DETECTIVE HUGO casually enters the lab, something odd in his
     nonchalant demeanor.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (excited)
              Hugo!  I've found him!

                           HUGO
              I've found him too.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (not listening, referring to his discovery)
              A fingerprint.  There's something to be
              said for nostalgia.
                      (realizing what Hugo has said)
              What did you find?

     Hugo puts a specimen bag on the counter.  It contains the
     Investigator's discarded tissue.  The Investigator does
     not recognize it.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              It's not exactly him.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (interest piqued)
              Where did you get this?

     The Investigator immediately deposits the tissue into an
     analyzer.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (referring to the tissue)
              But this man does share some common
              characteristics with your suspect.  Not so
              many but enough.  It appears the eyelash
              has a brother--of a kind.

     The Investigator realizes the significance and looks guiltily
     to Hugo.  Hugo exits the lab, leaving the Investigator to stare
     at his own FACE in his analyzing machine.


     INT.  GATTACA - JANITOR'S LOCKER ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CAESAR, the old janitor, enters the locker room.  He is about to
     wearily open his locker when he senses another presence in the
     room.

     He turns to find JEROME sitting there on a bench.  Although
     clearly delighted, CAESAR tries to disguise his pleasure.

                           CAESAR
              So you've finally seen sense and come back
              to your old job, Vincent.

                           JEROME
              Not yet, I'm afraid.

                           CAESAR
              No?  What's keeping you?

                           JEROME
              I guess I'm a slow learner.

                           CAESAR
              I guess so.
                      (looking up through the
                      small window)
              Well, while you're up there, maybe you could
              tidy the place up a bit.

                           JEROME
              I'll see what I can do.

     The two men embrace, Caesar breaking off before Jerome.

                           CAESAR
              And don't go getting everybody lost out there.
              You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have
              me to keep an eye on you, you know.

                           JEROME
                      (glancing to Caesar's locker)
              By the way, I left some trash in your locker.

                           CAESAR
                      (happy to oblige)
              I'll take care of it.

     Jerome departs.  Caesar watches him go and turns back to his
     locker.  He opens it to find a brand new, high-tech telescope
     sitting inside.

     The old janitor gets over his surprise and beams broadly -
     he looks back in Jerome's direction but he has gone.  The
     old janitor cannot help himself and reverently reaches for the
     telescope's eyepiece.


     INT.  GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  NIGHT.

     In the dimly-lit, empty computer complex, JEROME takes a last
     look around.  He sits at his computer, one final time replaying
     the graphic representation of his path through the cosmos that
     he is on the eve of taking for real.

     He notices the key missing from his keyboard.  Instantly
     realizing the significance, he rises from his seat to flee.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Vincent--

     Jerome is stopped in his tracks by the sound of his given name
     and the voice that calls it.

     He makes no further attempt to flee but turns to face his
     pursuer.  The Investigator steps out of the shadows.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Vincent, what are you running from?

                           JEROME
                      (disturbingly calm)
              From Vincent.

     The two men face each other for the first time in a long
     time.  The Investigator is transfixed by Jerome's face -
     scarcely able to believe his eyes.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Has it been so long, you don't remember
              who I am?

                           JEROME
                      (nodding to the Investigator's badge)
              Maybe it's you who's forgotten.
                      (meeting his gaze)
              What are you doing here, Anton?

     It is finally apparent the Investigator is Jerome's younger
     brother Anton [AS WE SHALL REFER TO THE INVESTIGATOR FOR THE
     REST OF THE FILM].

                           ANTON
              I could ask you the same question.
                      (glancing to the impressive complex)
              I have a right to be here, you don't.

     Jerome smiles at him condescendingly.

                           JEROME
              You almost sound like you believe that.

                           ANTON
                      (ignoring the remark, extending his hand)
              Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far
              as you can go.

                           JEROME
                      (refusing Anton's hand, glancing
                      to the telescope above them)
              There are a few million miles to go yet.

                           ANTON
                      (adamant)
              It's over.

                           JEROME
                      (shaking his head)
              Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton,
              to see me fail?

                           ANTON
              It's for the best.

                           JEROME
                      (increasingly angered)
              God, even you want to tell me what I can't do.
              In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't
              need rescuing.  But you did, once.

     Anton is clearly stung by the memory.

                           JEROME
                      (goading)
              Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that
              possible?

                           ANTON
                      (resolute)
              You didn't beat me that day.  I beat myself.

                           JEROME
              Who are you trying to convince?

                           ANTON
                      (angry)
              I will prove it to you.  Come swim with
              me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.

     Jerome regards Anton with a knowing smile.  Somewhere in Gattaca
     a phone rings.


     INT/EXT.  IRENE'S CAR OUTSIDE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  NIGHT.

     IRENE, sitting in her car outside Jerome's condominium, hangs up
     her portable phone.  In her agitation, her finger involuntarily
     goes to her pulse.  She catches herself and removes the finger
     from her wrist as if it has burned her.  She exits the car.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM/EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     IRENE quietly knocks on Jerome's door but there is no response.
     Trying the handle, the door opens.  Her curiosity takes her
     inside.  All is quiet.  IRENE calls out.

                           IRENE
              Hello.

     No reply.  Irene hesitantly ventures further, drawn to the
     spiral staircase.  She tentatively makes her way down the stairs
     and into Eugene's dimly lit condominium.  With wonder and
     reverence, she examines the instruments and samples laid out on
     Eugene's work benches.  She opens the refrigerator in the
     bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets.  Finally she
     regards the empty incinerator.

                           EUGENE (OC)
              Quite something, isn't it?

     Irene turns.

     Eugene has entered through the mirrored door, not at all
     displeased by her unexpected visit.

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the incinerator)
              That's where we get rid of the traces of him
              although we never truly succeeded.

                           IRENE
              I've been looking for him.  Do you know where
              he is?

                           EUGENE
                      (unconcerned)
              He's probably leaving some more of me
              around the place before he goes.

     Eugene idly inspects one of the blood sachets.

                           EUGENE
              Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are
              just the clothes.  He has to wear them.
              Something I could never do.

                           IRENE
              What's wrong with him?

                           EUGENE
                      (sympathetic smile)
              You have more in common than you know.

     Irene's hand involuntarily goes to her heart.

                           EUGENE
              But they say hisis already ten thousand beats
              overdue.  I have my doubts.
                      (wry smile)
              For all my gifts, they could never engineer
              me a heart like Vincent's.

     Irene turns back to the incinerator, lost in though.


     EXT.  BEACH.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and ANTON walk down a dune together towards the beach not
     far from Gattaca - an ocean beach pounded by an angry, black
     sea.  Jerome picks up a sharp piece of shell and slices the end
     of his thumb.  A drop of blood oozes out.  He offers the shell
     to Anton but Anton does not take it.

     Both men begin to disrobe.  The brothers stand beside each other
     on the sand once again - Anton still the more athletically-built
     of the two.

     Together, they enter the raging surf.  Diving through the
     breaking waves, they begin to swim.

     In the moonlit night, we watch their two bodies swimming side by
     side.  They swim a long distance, Anton waiting for his brother
     to tire.  But the pace does not slacken.  Anton pulls up in the
     water.  Sensing his brother is no longer beside him, Jerome also
     pulls up.  They tread water several yards apart.

                           ANTON
                      (attempting to conceal his distress)
              How are you doing this, Vincent?  How
              have you done any of this?

                           JEROME
              Now is your chance to find out.

     Jerome swims away a second time.  Anton is forced to follow
     once again.  Angry now, gritting his teeth, Anton calls
     upon the same determination we have witnessed during his
     constant swimming in the pool.  He puts on a spurt, slowly
     reeling in Jerome.

     Anton gradually draws alongside Jerome, certain that this effort
     will demoralize his older brother.  But Jerome has been foxing -
     waiting for him to catch up.  Jerome smiles at Anton.  With
     almost a trace of sympathy, he forges ahead again.  Anton is
     forced to go with him.  They swim again for a long distance.

     It is Anton who gradually becomes demoralized - his strokes
     weaken, his will draining away.  Anton pulls up, exhausted and
     fearful.  Jerome also pulls up.  However his face displays none
     of Anton's anxiety.

     They tread water several yards apart.  The ocean is choppier
     now.  The view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the
     peaks of the waves.

                           ANTON
                      (panic starting to show)
              Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out.
              We have to go back!

                           JEROME
                      (calling back)
              Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.

     Anton looks towards the empty horizon.

                           ANTON
              What other side?  How far do you want to go?!
              Do you want to drown us both?
                      (becoming hysterical)
              How are we going to get back?!

     Jerome merely smiles back at his younger brother, a disturbingly
     serene smile.

                           JEROME
                      (eerily calm)
              You wanted to know how I did it.  That's
              how I did it, Anton.  I never saved anything
              for the swim back.

     Anton stares at Jerome, aghast.  The two men face each other in
     silence, treading water several yards apart in the dark, rolling
     ocean.

     Jerome turns and heads back towards the shore.  Anton is left
     alone with the terrifying realization.  The only sound, the wind
     and the water.


     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME, dishevelled and distressed, arrives back at the
     condominium.  He notices IRENE standing at the edge of the pool.

     She turns.  He approaches her.  They stand several yards apart.
     Looking into each other's eyes, they do not speak.  Jerome
     abruptly pulls a hair from his head - for once one of his own.

                           JEROME
                      (wry smile, offering the hair to Irene)
              Here, take it.

     Irene takes the hair, the significance not lost on her.

                           JEROME
                      (echoing Irene's words from
                      their first encounter)
              If you're still interested, let me know.

     Irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment, then
     deliberately lets it fall to the ground.

                           IRENE
                      (never taking her eyes from him, echoing
                      Jerome's words from their first encounter)
              Sorry, the wind caught it.

     Once again there is not a breath of wind.  The hair lies,
     plainly visible on the edge of the pool.

     From an upstairs window, EUGENE observes the couple.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     We watch the silhouette of IRENE and JEROME making love in
     the bedroom.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE, sitting in his darkened room, unscrews the cap of a
     plastic container and places it on a nearby table.  We remain
     on Eugene's face as he opens his fly.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     IRENE and JEROME lie in bed together after making love.  For
     once Jerome is able to sleep unconcerned.  It is Irene who lies
     awake, head against JEROME'S chest, listening to the sound of
     his erratically beating heart.  However it has a soothing
     effect on her.

     She kisses Jerome and reluctantly rises from the bed.

                           JEROME
                      (awakening)
              A year is a long time.

                           IRENE
              Not so long--just once around the sun.

     Jerome smiles.  For once Irene seems to be looking forward
     to the trip.  She exits the room.


     INT.  INCINERATOR.  MORNING.

     Inside the incinerator, JEROME scrapes away at himself - for the
     final time.  He wistfully regards the brush in his hand.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  MORNING.

     JEROME, dressed for his departure, emerges down the spiral
     staircase into Eugene's condo.  Jerome notices several suitcases
     at the foot of the stairs.

     EUGENE wheels into the room.

                           EUGENE
              I have your samples ready.

                           JEROME
                      (confused)
              Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples
              where I'm going.

                           EUGENE
                      (meeting Jerome's gaze)
              No, but you might need them when you get back.

     Eugene wheels across the room and opens the mirrored door.  The
     water vapor billows out.  Jerome regards Eugene.

     Eugene leads Jerome inside for the first time.

     Inside are two rows of four identical, industrial refrigerators.
     They contain thousands of blood and urine specimens.

     Jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease.

                           EUGENE
              Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.

     EUGENE points out an extra specimen of semen in the first
     refrigerator.

                           EUGENE
              There's an extra specimen.  I wish I
              could give it to her myself.
                      (afterthought)
              But then, you always were better at being me.

     Eugene leads the way out of the refrigerator room.

                           JEROME
                      (struggling to come to terms
                      with the discovery)
              Why have you done this?

                           EUGENE
                      (as he seals the mirrored door)
              In case you get back before I do.

                           JEROME
              Where are you going?

                           EUGENE
                      (glancing to the suitcases)
              I'm travelling too.

     Jerome goes to question Eugene's travel plans but thinks better
     of it.  He kneels before his friend and embraces him.

                           JEROME
              Thank you.

                           EUGENE
              I got the better end of the deal.  I just
              lent you my body--you lent me your dream.

     Jerome smiles and hugs Eugene a final time.  Eugene stuffs an
     envelope into Jerome's pocket.

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the note,
                      glancing heavenwards)
              Not until you're upstairs.

     Jerome exits.  Eugene watches him go.


     INT.  GATTACA - DEPARTURE LOUNGE.  NIGHT.

     JEROME enters a large holding area along with his other eleven
     CREW MEMBERS.

     Jerome's heart sinks as he recognizes LAMAR, greeting the crew
     for one final unexpected substance test.  His colleagues
     groan good-naturedly but it is clearly far more than an
     inconvenience to Jerome.  He looks towards the door he has just
     entered but there is no way back.  One by one the crew are
     ushered behind a screen.  Before he can think of a way out, it
     is Jerome's turn.  He enters the cubicle.

                           JEROME
                      (as he takes the plastic cup from Lamar)
              What's this, Lamar?

                           LAMAR
              New policy.

     From behind, we see Jerome unzip his fly.  However for once
     Jerome does not urinate on cue - unused to operating his own
     equipment in front of the physician.

                           LAMAR
                      (intrigued by the
                      out-of-character discharge)
              Flight got you nervous?

                           JEROME
              There's a problem, Lamar.

                           LAMAR
                      (apparently not listening)
              Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's
              a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.

     Jerome realizes he has no choice.  Resigned to his fate, he
     begins to fill the cup.

                           JEROME
                      (as he urinates)
              Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up
              and back and nobody would have been the wiser--

                           LAMAR
                      (cutting him off)
              --Unfortunately my son's not all that they
              promised.  But then, who know what he could do.

     Lamar takes the cup from Jerome in his gloved hand.  Jerome
     anxiously watches his sample poured into the analyzer.

     Confirming Jerome's worst fears, the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT
     appears on the computer screen.  However Lamar does not look at
     the screen.  He stares Jerome in the eye.

                           LAMAR
              For future reference--
                      (a brief glance to where
                      Jerome has just zipped his fly)
              --righthanded men don't hold it with their
              left.  It's just one of those things.

     Never lookig at the screen, Lamar presses a button marked,
     "VALID".

                           LAMAR
                      (knowing smile)
              Have a safe trip, Vincent.

     Jerome exits up a long enclosed escalator, realizing that Lamar
     has known all along.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE knocks back a vodka.  With a certain reverence he places
     his silver medal around his neck.


     INT.  ESCALATOR.  NIGHT.

     At the top of a long escalator, the door to a craft is secured.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     Eugene's wheelchair, empty, sits beside the door of the
     incinerator, also secured.


     EXT.  LAUNCHPAD.  NIGHT.

     A CLOSE UP of the flame of a rocket's engines igniting - the
     ball of fire engulfs the launchpad - filling the screen.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM - INCINERATOR.  NIGHT.

     Inside the incinerator another ball of fire - this time
     engulfing the unseen figure of EUGENE.  We glimpse the medal
     around his neck, melting in the fierce blaze.


     EXT.  GATTACA - LAUNCHPAD.  NIGHT.

     As we have seen so often in the past, a rocket launches into
     the sky over Gattaca - however on this occasion it carries
     Jerome.


     INT.  SPACECRAFT.  NIGHT.

     We focus on JEROME's face - seeing little if any of the craft.
     Jerome's eyes are closed.  His head is still - alarmingly still.
     Could the launch itself have been too much for him?  He hear the
     thoguhts in his head.

                           JEROME (VO)
              We came from the stars so they say, now
              it's time to go back.  If I was conceived
              today, I would not get beyond eight cells,
              and yet here I am.  In a way they were
              right, I don't have the heart for this world.
                      (pause)
              The question is, why am I having so much
              trouble dying?

     Jerome's eyes blink open.  He holds the letter from Eugene in
     his hand.  It contains no words, merely a lock of EUGENE'S hair
     - for once preserved solely for its sentimental value.  The
     hair, weightless, floats off the page.

     We focus on a porthole looking out upon a starscape.


     A STARSCAPE

     As we pan across the constellations, a title is superimposed
     upon the starscape:

              In a few short years, scientists will
              have completed the Human Genome Project,
              the mapping of all the genes that make
              up a human being.

              After 4 billion years of evolution by the
              slow and clumsy method of natural selection,
              we have now evolved to the point where we
              can direct our own evolution.

     The first title is replaced in the heavens by a second title.

              If only we had aquired this knowledge
              sooner, the following people would never
              have been born:

     A succession of portraits and photographs of RENOWNED and
     HISTORIC FIGURES fades in and out of the constellations - the
     accompanying titles list their affliction rather than their
     accomplishments.

                               HOMER
                         Blind from birth

                         NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
                              Epileptic

                               COLETTE
                              Arthritic

                              LOU GERHIG
                      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
                         (Lou Gerhig's Disease)

                             RITA HAYWORTH
                         Alzheimer's Disease

                             HELEN KELLER
                            Blind and deaf

                           STEPHEN HAWKING

                         JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                             Asthmatic

                           CHARLES DARWIN
                          Chronic invalid

     The face of Charles Darwin fades off and another title appears
     out of the stars.

              Even Charles Darwin, the man who told of
              the survival of the fittest, numbered
              amongst our frailest.

     The title fades off and is replaced by one final title in the
     night sky.

              Of course, the other birth that would
              surely never have taken place is your own.

                                                          A Screen Play 
                                                    by Andrew M. Niccol





     FADE IN

     A white title appears on a black screen.

              "As night-fall does not come at once, neither
              does oppression...It is in such twilight that
              we all must be aware of change in the air
              - however slight - lest we become victims of
              the darkness."
                            Justice William O. Douglas


     The title fades off, replaced by a second title.

              "I not only think that we will tamper with
              Mother Nature, I think Mother wants us to."

                                William Gaylin

     The second title fades off, leaving a dark screen.

     The darkness gradually gives way to a dawning light.

     We are confronted with sight of a barren, empty landscape.  A
     wide expanse of wasteland.

     Suddenly, without warning, an elephant tusk falls from the sky
     and crashes onto the parched ground.  The earth-shuddering
     impact causes the tusk to rebound once in slow motion before
     finally settling to the desert floor in a cloud of dust.

     The first tusk is quickly followed by a second, also dropping
     from the heavens.  It lands near the first.  Another tusk
     smashes to earth several yards away.  Yet another comes crashing
     into the foreground.

     Finally the dust settles upon a graveyard of tusks.

     DISSOLVE TO


     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE

     In another region of the wasteland, a forest of tree trunks
     suddenly rains down from the sky.  The trunks thump to the hard
     ground, also rebounding in slow motion.  Cleanly sawn,
     branchless, palm-like trunks, they come to rest in the dust only
     to be followed by a second cascade of lumber.

     When the dust finally clears. the felled tree trunks lie in a
     huge, log-jam in the desert.

     DISSOLVE TO


     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE

     Next to descend from the sky, a torrent of firewood.  One shower
     after another, crashing to the plain.  Enough chopped lumber to
     fuel a thousand hearths.

     DISSOLVE TO


     A BARREN, EMPTY LANDSCAPE

     Joining the rest of the debris is a deluge of slate - sheets
     of shale from a great unseen quarry in the sky come slamming to
     earth.  Some of the pieces shattering, some rebounding into the
     air until the granite litters acres of landscape as far as the
     eye can see.

     TITLES ARE SPACED APPROPRIATELY THROUGHOUT THE PRECEDING
     SEQUENCE.  THE FINAL TITLE READS:

        T H E   N O T  -  T O O  -  D I S T A N T   F U T U R E

     The camera commences a long, slow pull-back from the pile of
     elephant tusks.  Gradually they are revealed as human
     fingernails magnified many hundreds of times.

     The tree trunks are mere hair follicles.  The firewood,
     whiskers.  The slate, flakes of skin.


     INT.  INCINERATOR.  EARLY MORNING.

     A naked MAN, thirties, seen in profile, is crouched upon a metal
     floor inside a small, brushed stainless steel tank, rubbing his
     skin raw with a wire brush.  JEROME MORROW.

     Having completed his scrupulous ablutions, Jerome arches his
     lean frame through the small, oval door of the metal room
     with practised ease.

     Securing the thick, fireproof windowed door behind himself, he
     turns a switch to release gas into the vacated chamber.  The gas
     instantly ignites in what is now revealed to be a gleaming
     modern stainless-steel custom-made incinerator.

     We refocus on a MAGNIFIED CLOSE UP of his exfoliated flesh in
     the incinerator as it blackens, curls and burns.

     Jerone covers himself with a silk robe and steps into a pair of
     backless slippers.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.

     JEROME emerges from the incinerator room into a large, luxurious
     loft-style condo containing a bizarre assortment of equipment -
     arranged somewhat like a production line.

     Long, scrupulously clean metal work benches are arranged along
     one entire wall.  Laid out on the benches in neat rows are
     dozens of plastic bags - some filled, some unfilled.  Instruments
     on trays - various types of tweezers, scissors and other less
     familiar utensils.  Round, stainless steel containers filled
     with hairs of differing lengths and other body matter.

     JEROME approaches another man slumped over one of the benches.
     EUGENE.  He clutches an empty vodka bottle.  He is snoring
     lightly - sleeping off the night before.  As JEROME gently
     prises the bottle out of his hand, we are struck by the
     similarity of Eugene's face to Jerome's.

     Jerome pulls Eugene's chair back from the desk with surprising
     ease.  A wheelchair - a modern, ergonomic design.  Jerome wheels
     Eugene to a bedroom and, with some difficulty, hauls the larger
     man onto the bed.  Through his alcoholic fog, Eugene feebly co-
     operates - his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight.

     After covering Eugene with a blanket, Jerome enters a bathroom
     containing a surgically-clean stainless steel basin, sink,
     shower and toilet.

     Beside the toilet stands a large, industrial-style stainless
     steel refrigerator.

     Donning protective gloves, Jerome opens the liquid-nitrogen
     cooled refrigerator.  A cloud of condensed water vapor billows
     out.  Revealed inside the fridge are racks of labelled jars and
     silicon pouches - some containing a yellowish liquid, some a
     deep, red liquid.

     In front of one of the jars is a handwritten shopping list -
     "TRUFFLES, CIGS, VODKA".  Jerome smiles to himself as he
     retrieves the note along with one of the jars.  He checks the
     jar's label.  Satisfied with the date written there, he breaks
     the seal and pours the contents into the clear, silicon pouch of
     an IV-like device lying on the steel bathroom counter.

     He seals the pouch and checks the apparatus by opening the valve
     on its fine tube and squirting a small quantity of the liquid
     into the nearby toilet bowl, as one would test a syringe.  We
     remain on Jerome's face as he reaches between his legs and
     inserts the pouch.

     Reopening the refrigerator, Jerome slides out a tray containing
     neat rows of slim, fingertip-sized plastic sachets filled with a
     deep, red-colored liquid.  He removes his gloves, selects one of
     the sachets and carefully adheres the sachet to the pad at the
     end of his index finger.  He prepares a second sachet for his
     middle finger.  Jerome then applies skin-colored cover-up makeup
     to the sachets, blending them in with the color of his fingers.
     JEROME, still dressed in his robe, climbs a large, spiral
     staircase to the floor above.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  EARLY MORNING.

     He emerges at the top of the staircase into a similarly large,
     loft-stlye condominium.  Through the floor to ceiling window
     that opens onto a balcony we see that dawn is only just starting
     to leak into the night sky.

     In the bedroom JEROME removes a shirt from a drycleaning bag.
     Printed on the bag - "Confidentiality Guaranteed".  He emerges
     from his bedroom, dressed in a smart albeit unconventionally cut
     suit.  He adjusts his tie in the mirror, careful not to disturb
     the sachets attached to his fingertips.


     INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S POOL.  MORNING.

     A lone MAN swims a ferocious lap of freestyle in what appears to
     be a pool of enormous length - yet he never reaches the pool's
     end.  We pull wider to reveal that the man is swimming against
     an artificial current in a pool barely larger than himself.

     Abruptly, the man stops and stands up - the fast-flowing current
     instantly stilled.  We glimpse the face of INVESTIGATOR LUCAS.
     Thirties, he has a youthful yet rigid face.  We have the
     impression that he does not swim for pleasure.


     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  MORNING.

     It is still early as JEROME exits the building's underground
     parking garage in an immaculate Studebaker Avanti and proceeds
     down the long straight driveway.  He exchanges a wave with a
     GARDENER trimming a lawn.

     The whir of the car's electric powered engine belies its
     conventional appearance.


     EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.

     JEROME's car exits a highway and turns up the sweeping road
     leading to the parking lot of "GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION".
     A sleek, modern, low-rise industrial compound boasting perfectly
     manicured landscaped gardens.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  DAY.

     JEROME strides purposefully up to the entranceway with hundreds
     of other GATTACA EMPLOYEES.  He carries himself with a certain
     arrogance, a cool detachment.  All employees wear similarly
     unconventionally-cut suits, short coiffed hair and robust tans.
     The Gattaca employees are a seemingly equal split of men and
     women and a diverse range of ethnicities.

     They filter through a row of channels supervised by SECURITY
     GUARDS.  Each channel contains a computerized security device,
     featuring a slim groove in which the employee places a finger
     under the watchful eye of a Security Guard.

     Jerome gives a polite nod to a Guard as he places his index
     finger in the groove.  His fingertip is jabbed with the
     finest of needles and a minute blood sample taken.

     The blood specimen confirms Jerome's identity - an ID photograph
     appearing on a computer screen.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Jerome spies a young woman
     entering through the adjacent channel.  She is also sneaking a
     glance in his direction - IRENE.  Catching each other looking,
     they both quickly avert their eyes.

     As Jerome enters the computer facility of Gattaca Aerospace
     Corporation he furtively glances at the pin-prick puncture in
     his fingertip sachet.


     SOMEWHERE IN DEEP SPACE.

     A GATTACA spacecraft skirts an asteroid.  Taking advantage of
     the rock's gravitational pull, the craft slingshots deeper into
     the black void.  Then abruptly the craft and the asteroid freeze
     in mid-space, suddenly reverse direction and proceed forward
     again - the spacecraft taking a slightly adjusted course.

     We pull back to reveal that the journey is merely a highly
     realistic graphic representation on a GATTACA computer screen
     operated by JEROME.

     Appearing simultaneously alongside the computer animation is a
     seemingly never-ending column of computer instructions for this
     celestial navigation - the incomprehensible language of the
     computer programmer.

              140 #x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20x08x$$x20{
              150 #x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00x00
              160 #xfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfe

     Jerome is transported - plotting a path through the heavens.
     As his fingers fly across the keys he does not once take his
     eyes from the screen.

     His is one of hundreds of ergonomically designed work stations,
     arranged in ever-widening circles in a huge, curcular, well-
     appointed if antiseptic room.  Each curved desk contains a
     computer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim,
     transparent screen behind which is seated a PROGRAMMER,
     designing software for the aerospace agency.  At the center of
     the room is a donut-shaped command console, chairs facing
     outwards, from which operations are monitored.

     Floor to ceiling smoked-glass curved walls offer the only
     concession to nature - a tinted view of a man-made, meticulously
     landscaped garden.

     Jerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a
     discreet mini-vac.  He vacuums between the keys of his keyboard.
     DIRECTOR JOSEF, 50's, a shorter, official-looking man
     approaches.  His assistant IRENE stands at his shoulder.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              You keep your work station so clean, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              --Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?

     The Director smiles at the notion and places a computer disc
     on Jerome's desk.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              I reviewed your flight plan.  Not one error
              in a hundred thousand keystrokes.  Phenomenal.
                      (placing a hand on Jerome's shoulder)
              It's right that someone like you is taking us
              to the Belt.
                      (glancing to notification on Jerome's screen)
              You have a substance test.

     The Director briskly departs, Irene in tow.  At a nearby work
     station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at
     the mention of the test.

     Jerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his
     ankle.  However he surreptitiously produced one of Eugene's
     transparent specimen bags from his sock.  An EXTREME CLOSE UP
     reveals the bag's contents - flakes of skin, hair follicles,
     eyelashes, a fingernail.  Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid
     detection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his
     keyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station.

     He opens his desk drawer and casually scatters the remainder of
     the bag.  Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two
     hair follicles.

     Jerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the
     testing lab.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - TESTING LABORATORY.  DAY.

     White-coated LAMAR, forties, buzzcut, a man's man, checks
     JEROME's eyes with an instrument.  Satisfied with his
     examination, he passes a transparent plastic container to
     JEROME.  Standing directly in front of the technician with his
     back to camera, Jerome opens his fly.  A steady stream of urine
     begins to flow into the container from Jerome's hidden pouch.

                           LAMAR
                      (staring admiringly at the discharge)
              Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command.
              You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told
              you that, Jerome?

                           JEROME
                      (deadpan as he continues to urinate)
              Only every time I'm in here.

     Jerome hands the container to Lamara who seals and label it as
     Jerome refastens his trousers.

                           LAMAR
              I see a lot of cocks.  I speak from experience.
              Yours is a beautiful example.  Why didn't my
              folks order a cock like that for me?

     LAMAR pours the urine sample into a high-tech device where it
     is instantly analyzed.  The urine identifies Jerone while also
     registering a negative drug reading.  The computer reads
     "VALID".

                           LAMAR
                      (walking Jerome to the door)
              If everything goes to plan, this could be the
              last time I see you for a while.  One week to
              go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.

                           JEROME
              I'll tell you at the end of the week.

     Jerome departs.


     INT.  GATTACA - RESTROOM.  DAY.

     JEROME enters the restroom and glances at the toilet stalls.
     Only three in the bank of twenty is occupied.  He tarries at the
     mirror above the uniform line of basins, unnecessarily
     reknotting his tie.

     A toilet flushes and a COLLEAGUE exits one of the stalls.  He
     and Jerome exchange a nod.  When the man has exited the restroom,
     Jerome enters the man's vacated stall.


     INT.  GATTACA - TOILET STALL.  DAY.

     JEROME immediately feels around the back of the toilet bowl and
     detaches a secreted stainless steel container.

     With surprising swiftness and dexterity, Jerome removes an
     extremely fine contact lens from each eye and drops the pair
     into the toilet bowl.  He inserts two replacement lenses from
     the container and reattaches it in its hiding place.
     Jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall.  He checks in the
     mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted.


     INT.  GATTACA - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

     Walking back along one of the long, glass-walled corridors,
     JEROME becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex -
     or to be more precise, a lack of noise.  The incessant tapping
     of computer keys has stilled.

     As Jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor, we see the
     reflection of his face, deep in thought.

                           JEROME (VO)
              The most unremarkable of events.  Jerome
              Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days
              away from a one-year manned mission to 951
              Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt.  Nothing so
              unique in that.  Last year over one thousand
              citizens from every walk of life embarked on
              some space mission or other.  Besides,
              selection for Jerome was virtually guaranteed
              at birth.  He is blessed with all the physical
              and intellectual gifts required for such an
              arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second
              to none.

     Jerome's gaze drifts to the sky.

                           JEROME (VO)
              No, there is truly nothing remarkable about
              the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I
              am not Jerome Morrow.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DUSK - THIRTY-ODD YEARS EARILER

     A starry sky.  The camera tilts down to find palm trees
     swaying against a setting sun.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I was conceived in the Riviera.  Not the
              French Riviera.

     The camera tilts down further to find a Buick Riviera parked in
     a deserted beachfront parking lot on a polluted stretch of
     beach.

                           JEROME (VO)
              The Detroit variety.

     Through the car's steamed windows we see Jerome's mother and
     father, MARIA and ANTONIO, early twenties, making love.

                           JEROME (VO)
              They used to say that a child conceived in love,
              has a greater chance of happiness.  They don't
              say that any more.


     INT.  FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC.  DAY.

     MARIA, wearing a medical gown, lies on an examining table, feet
     in stirrups.  A NURSE, forties, wheels an instrument tray
     towards her.  Maria suddenly disengages her feet from the
     stirrups and swings her legs off the table.

                           NURSE
              What are you doing?

                           MARIA
                      (shaking her head)
              I can't do this.

                           NURSE
                      (misinterpreting the problem)
              I told you, the government pays.  It's all
              taken care of.

                           MARIA
              No, you don't understand.  I can't.

     The nurse places a comforting hand on Maria's shoulder.

                           NURSE
                      (reassuring)
              The doctor will give you something.

                           MARIA
                      (removing the hand, adamant)
              I'm not doing it.

                           NURSE
                      (trying to make her see reason)
              Honey, you've made one mistake--

     The remark stings Maria.

                           NURSE
                      (softening her tone)
              --I've read your profile.  I don't
              know about the father but you carry
              enough hereditary factors on your own.
                      (pause)
              You can have other children.

                           MARIA
                      (holding her swollen stomach protectively)
              Not like this one.

                           NURSE
                      (trying to be diplomatic)
              Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't
              want one like that one.

     Maria gets off the table and reaches for her clothes laying
     across a chair.

                           MARIA
                      (irate)
              You don't know what it will be!

     The nurse watches Maria as she dresses, genuinely bewildered.

                           NURSE
                      (calling out to Maria as she disappears
                      out of the door)
              The child won't thank you!


     INT.  DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY.

     We focus on a crucifix dangling on a rosary.  Tilting up we find
     the rosary clasped between MARIA and ANTONIO's intertwined
     hands.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Those were early days--days when a priest
              could still persuade someone to put their
              faith in God's hands rather than those of
              the local geneticist.

     Bathed in sweat, Maria gives a final push on the delivery table.

     While still attached to his umbilical cord, the heel of the
     NEWBORN BABY BOY is immediately pricked by a masked NURSE.  A
     minute drop of blood is inserted into an analyzing machine.

     Even as the baby is put into Maria's arms, page after page of
     data begins to appear on a monitor, pulsing warning signals
     throughout the spreadsheets.

     Two assisting NURSES exchange a look.  Antonio senses something
     amiss.

                           ANTONIO
              What's wrong?

                           JEROME (VO)
              Of course, there was nothing wrong with me.
              Not so long ago I would have been considered
              a perfectly healthy, normal baby.  Ten fingers,
              ten toes.  That was all that used to matter.
              But now my immediate well-being was not the
              sole concern.

     Antonio turns his attention from his baby to the data appearing
     on the monitor.  We see individual items highlighted amongst the
     data - "NERVE CONDITION - PROBABILITY 60%", "MANIC DEPRESSION -
 42%", "OBESITY - 66%", "ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER - 89%"-- 
 JEROME (VO)               My destiny was mapped out before me--
              all my flaws, predispositions and
              susceptibilities - most untreatable to
              this day.  Only minutes old, the date and
              cause of my death was already known.

     Antonio focuses on a final highlighted item on the monitor's
     screen, "HEART DISORDER - 99% - EARLY FATAL POTENTIAL.".
     "LIFE EXPECTANCY - 33 YEARS".

                           NURSE
              The name?
                      (typing details into birth certificate)
              For the certificate.

                           MARIA
              Antonio--

                           ANTONIO
                      (correcting her)
              --No, Vincent Antonio.

     With a computer stylus he signs the nurse's handheld screen.


     EXT.  TRACT HOME - BACKYARD.  DAY.

     2-YEAR-OLD JEROME (REFERRED TO BY HIS GIVEN NAME OF "VINCENT"
     FOR MOST OF THE FOLLOWING FLASHBACK) running with a toy rocket
     falls more in clumsiness than fatigue.  MARIA suddenly whisks up
     the toddler.

                           MARIA
                      (hysterical)
              Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let
              you out of my sight.

     Maria frantically listens to her young son's heartbeat.  For
     his part, Vincent appears surprised by the attention.  Maria
     places a portable oxygen mask over Vincent's mouth.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I was born Vincent Antonio Luca.  And from
              an early age I came to think of myself as
              others thought of me - chronically ill.
              Every skinned knee and runny nose treated
              as if it were life-threatening.


     INT.  DAY CARE CENTER.  DAY.

     MARIA and ANTONIO drop off dark-haired 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT at a
     Day Care Center.

                           JEROME (VO)
              And my parents soon realized that wherever
              I went, my genetic prophecy preceded me.

     While HEALTHY CHILDREN play outside on tricycles, clamber over
     jungle-gyms and finger-paint, the PRE-SCHOOL TEACHER shows
     Vincent into a room where CHILDREN WITH OBVIOUS DISABILITIES
     sleep on mats.

     Maria wheels around and marches out of the center with Vincent
     in her arms.  Antonio follows close behind, pleading with his
     wife to see sense.

                           JEROME (VO)
              They put off having any more children
              until they could afford not to gamble -
              to bring a child into the world in what
              has become the "natural" way.


     EXT.  HOME.  DAY.

     ANTONIO reluctantly shows off his spotless Buick Riviera to a
     prospective BUYER.

                           JEROME (VO)
              It meant selling the beloved Buick.

     The two men haggle over the price while MARIA, holding VINCENT
     in her arms, looks on.  Finally money and a pink slip are
     exchanged.

                           VINCENT (VO)
              My father got a good price.  After all,
              the only accident he'd ever had in that
              car was me.

     As the BUYER drives away, Antonio shrugs to Maria to hide his
     disappointment.


     EXT.  GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE BUILDING.  DAY.

     ANTONIO, MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT exit a packed commuter
     bus and enter a Genetic Counselling office building bearing
     the sign - "PRO-CREATION".


     INT.  GENETIC COUNSELLING OFFICE.  DAY.

     A GENETICIST stares into a high-powered microscope as ANTONIO,
     MARIA and 2-YEAR-OLD VINCENT are shown into the office by a
     NURSE.  On the counter beside the Geneticist is a glass-doored
     industrial refrigerator containing petri dishes arranged on
     racks several feet high.

                           GENETICIST
                      (to the nurse, without taking
                       his eyes from his binocular microscope)
              Put up the dish.

     While Antonio and Maria take a seat in front of a television
     monitor, the Nurse puts a labelled petri dish under a video-
     equipped microscope.  The Geneticist swings around in his chair
     to greet his clients.

     Four magnified clusters of cells - eight cells on each cluster
     - appear on the television screen.

                           GENETICIST
              Your extracted eggs...
                      (noting the couple's names from
                      data along the edge of the screen)
              ...Maria, have been fertilized with...
              Antonio's sperm and we have performed an
              analysis of the resulting pre-embryos.
              After screening we're left with two healthy
              boys and two healthy girls.  Naturally, no
              critical pre-dispositions to any of the major
              inheritable diseases.  All that remains is
              to select the most compatible candidate.

     Maria and Antonio exchange a nervous smile.

                           GENETICIST
              First, we may as well decide on gender.
              Have you given it any thought?

                           MARIA
                      (referring to the toddler
                      on her knee)
              We would like Vincent to have a brother...
              you know, to play with.

     The Geneticist nods.  He scans the data around the edge of the
     screen.

                           GENETICIST
              You've already specified blue eyes, dark
              hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty
              of eradicating any potentially prejudicial
              conditions - premature baldness, myopia,
              alcoholism and addictive susceptibility,
              propensity for violence and obesity--

                           MARIA
                      (interrupting, anxious)
              --We didn't want--diseases, yes.

                           ANTONIO
                      (more diplomatic)
              We were wondering if we should leave some
              things to chance.

                           GENETICIST
                      (reassuring)
              You want to give your child the best possible
              start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection
              built-in already.  Your child doesn't need
              any additional burdens.  And keep in mind,
              this child is still you, simply the best of you.
              You could conceive naturally a thousand times
              and never get such a result.

                           ANTONIO
                      (squeezing Maria's hand)
              He's right, Maria.  That's right.

     Maria is only half-convinced, but the Geneticist swiftly moves
     on.

                           GENETICIST
              Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed
              child?

                           ANTONIO
                      (blank)
              Er, no...

                           GENETICIST
                      (explaining)
              Some believe it is associated with creativity,
              although there's no evidence.  Also for
              sports like baseball it can be an advantage.

                           ANTONIO
                      (shrugs)
              I like football.

                           GENETICIST
                      (injecting a note of levity)
              I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going
              to be at least a head taller than you.
              Prepare for a crick in the neck in
              sixteen years time.

     Antonio beams proudly.

                           GENETICIST
                      (scanning the data on the screen)
              Anything I've forgotten?

                           MARIA
                      (hesitant about broaching the subject)
              We want him--we were hoping he would get
              married and have children.  We'd like
              grandchildren.

                           GENETICIST
                      (conspiratorial smile)
              I understand.  That's already been taken
              care of.
                      (an afterthought)
              Now you appreciate I can only work with
              the raw material I have at my disposal but
              for a little extra...I could also attempt to
              insert sequences associated with enhanced
              mathematical or musical ability.

                           MARIA
                      (suddenly enthused)
              Antonio, the choir...

                           GENETICIST
                      (interjecting, covering himself)
              I have to caution you it's not fool-proof.
              With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.

                           ANTONIO
              How much extra?

                           GENETICIST
              It would be five thousand more.

     Antonio's face falls.

                           ANTONIO
              I'm sorry, there's no way we can.

                           GENETICIST
              Don't worry.  You'll probably do just
              as well singing to him in the womb.
                      (rising to end the appointment)
              We can implant the most successful
              pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.

     Maria is staring at the four magnified clumps on the screen.

                           MARIA
              What will happen to the others?

                           GENETICIST
                      (reassuring)
              They are not babies, Maria, merely
              "human possibilities".

     Removing the petri dish from beneath the lens of the microscope,
     he points out the four minuscule specks.

                           GENETICIST
              Smaller than a grain of sand.

     DISSOLVE TO


     INT.  TRACT HOME.  DAY.

     A red pencil draws a mark on a doorway at the height of a
     child's head.  The child moves away and the name, "ANTON 11" is
     written beside the mark by proud father, ANTONIO.

                           JEROME (VO)
              That's how my brother, Anton, came into the
              world - a son my father considered worthy
              of his name.

     There is little physical similarity between 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON
     and 13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT standing beside him, apart from their
     height.  In fact Vincent is mortified to see that his younger
     brother's mark is a fraction of an inch higher than the mark
     beside his own name, "VINCENT 13".  Vincent runs from the room.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DAY.

     13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT and 11-YEAR-OLD ANTON sit together on a
     windswept beach.

     Anton picks up a broken shell and deliberately slices the tip of
     his thumb with the sharp edge.  He hands the shell to Vincent
     who hesitantly follows suit.

                           JEROME (VO)
              By the time we were playing at blood
              brothers I understood that there was something
              very different flowing through my veins.

     The two brothers press their thumbs together, merging the blood.

                           JEROME (VO)
              And I'd need an awful lot more than
              a drop if I was going to get anywhere.


     EXT.  BEACH.  LATER IN THE DAY.

     While ANTONIO and MARIA doze under a beach umbrella, ANTON and
     VINCENT enter the water, diving through the waves.  From above
     we watch their two young bodies swimming beside each other
     beyond the breakers.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Our favorite game was "chicken".  When our
              parents weren't watching, we used to swim outside
              the flags, as far out as we dared.  It was about
              who would get scared and turn back first.

     Suddenly VINCENT stops swimming, pulling up sharply in the
     water, exhausted and fearful.  He watches ANTON swim on into the
     distance.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Of course, it was always me.  Anton was by far
              the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.


     INT.  SCHOOL - CLASSROOM.  DAY.

     A TEACHER gives a physics lesson.  The bespectacled 13-YEAR-OLD
     VINCENT has his arm energetically raised at each opportunity but
     is never called upon.  Eventually he lowers his arm in defeat.

                           JEROME (VO)
              My genetic scarlet letter continued to follow
              me from school to school.  When you're told
              you're prone to learning disabilities, it's
              sometimes easier not to disappoint anybody.


     EXT.  STREET.  NIGHT.

     13-YEAR-OLD VINCENT stands at a cul-de-sac at the end of a long,
     straight deserted street.  He places a basketball in the middle
     of the street to represent the SUN and begins to unwind the huge
     reel of string attached to the ball.  11-YEAR-OLD ANTON walks a
     pace behind him.  Several yards along the trail a bead is
     threaded through the string to represent the planet MERCURY.

                           ANTON
              How many astronauts are there, anyway?

     Vincent ignores him and continues to reel out the string.

                           ANTON
              I bet I could be one.

     Vincent stops and regards his younger brother with contempt.

                           VINCENT
              You're standing on Venus.

     Anton lifts his foot.  There is a bead beneath it.


     INT/EXT.  CAR / SATELLITE DISH.  DUSK.

     VINCENT has developed into a handsome 17-YEAR-OLD.  His
     spectacles hidden, he and a YOUNG WOMAN are necking in the front
     seat of a beat-up car, parked overlooking a huge satellite dish.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I was popular enough until it got around
              that I wasn't a long-term proposition.

     The love-making intensifies.  The YOUNG WOMAN moves down
     Vincent's chest and unzips his fly.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Those who didn't know already could easily
              find out for themselves.  It was certainly
              no problem coaxing the information out of me.

     We remain on Vincent's face as he climaxes.  The YOUNG WOMAN
     turns her head away from the spent Jerome and, out of his
     view, trickles semen from her mouth into a clear specimen vial.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I didn't blame them.  You need to know if a
              prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage
              or life insurance or can hold down a decent job.


     INT.  HOME.  DAY.

     In the living room of their modest home, the dark-haired, 17-
     year-old, bespectacled VINCENT sits opposite his PARENTS.  The
     crestfallen Vincent has a book on his lap entitled "CAREERS IN
     SPACE".

                           MOTHER
                      (trying to break it gently)
              Vincent, you have to be realistic.  A
              heart condition like yours--

                           VINCENT
              --I don't care.  I'll take the risk.

                           MOTHER
              It's not just you they have to be concerned
              about.  Perhaps we could get you one of
              those new pacemakers.  They're not perfect
              but--

                           FATHER
                      (letting his frustration show)
              For God's sake, Vincent, don't you understand.
              The only way you'll see the inside of a space
              ship is if you're cleaning it!

     Vincent looks at his father in disbelief.

     On a dinner table on the other side of the living room, 15-YEAR-
     OLD ANTON looks up from the biological specimen he is studying
     with a magnifying glass.


     INT.  PERSONNEL OFFICE - WAITING ROOM.  DAY.

     17-YEAR-OLD VINCENT hides his glasses in his pocket as he enters
     a WAITING ROOM.  He gazes around at other APPLICANTS.

                           JEROME (VO)
              My father was right.  It didn't matter how
              much I lied on my resumÈ, my real C.V. was
              in my cells.  Why should anybody invest all
              that money to train me, when there are a
              thousand other applicants with a far cleaner
              profile?  Of course, it's illegal to discriminate -
              "genoism" it's called - but no one takes the
              laws seriously.

     As Jerome enters the office, we focus on the doorhandle he has
     just touched.

                           JEROME (VO)
              If you refuse to disclose, they can always
              take a sample from a doorhandle...

     Vincent hesitates before shaking the PERSONNEL OFFICER's
     outstretched hand.

                           JEROME (VO)
              ...or a handshake...

     We focus on Jerome's envelope attached to his application form
     sitting on the Manager's desk.

                           JEROME (VO)
              ...even the saliva off your application form.

     Sitting opposite the manager, Jerome's face falls.  The manager
     puts a clear, plastic cup in front of Jerome.

                           JEROME (VO)
              But for the most part we know who we are.
              And if all else fails, a legal drug test
              can just as easily become an illegal peek
              at your future in the company.

     Vincent saves the Manager the trouble and exits the office,
     leaving the cup where it sits.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DAY.

     17-YEAR-OLD JEROME walks up the beach to find 15-YEAR-OLD ANTON
     sitting with the YOUNG WOMAN Vincent had previously dated.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I didn't blame Anton for his free ride.  You
              can't blame someone for winning the lottery.

     The Young Woman hastily departs.

     LATER the two brothers face each other on the sand.  Anton is
     the more statuesque of the two.

                           ANTON
                      (cocky)
              You sure you want to do this?

     Vincent's answer is to walk towards the water.  Anton smiles
     mockingly at his brother's grim "game face" and
     follows.

     From an aerial view we watch VINCENT and his younger brother, ANTON,
     swim beyond the breakers.

                           JEROME (VO)
              It was the last time we swam together.
              Out into the open sea, like always,
              knowing each stroke towards the horizon
              was one we had to make back to the
              shore.  Like always, the unspoken contest.

     We watch the two young men swimming stroke for stroke.  They
     swim far out, beyond the point.  Suddenly ANTON starts to slow,
     his strokes becoming labored until he becomes motionless in the
     water.  He begins to sink like a stone.  VINCENT, realizing
     Anton is no longer beside him, turns back to lend support.
     Vincent takes him in a lifeguard hold and begins to nurse him
     back to shore.  Finally the two boys are coughed up onto the
     shallows.  They collapse, just beyond the waterline, exhausted,
     gasping for air.  ANTONIO and MARIA arrive on the scene.  ANTON
     is the first to recover while VINCENT clutches his side, his
     face screwed up in pain.  Maria kneels down and starts to
     administer to Vincent but his father, Antonio, is unable to
     conceal his anger and contempt for Vincent.

                           ANTONIO
              Vincent, you damn fool!  You could have killed
              Anton with your ridiculous contest!  Why should
              he risk his life to save yours?!  When are you
              going to get it through your thick head--you
              can't compete with your brother!  Why try?!

     Maria takes Antonio aside.  Anton and Vincent exchange a look.

                           ANTON
              Why didn't you say anything?

                           VINCENT
              Why didn't you?
                        (staring back at his father knowingly)
              It's okay.  It's the way they want it.

                           JEROME (VO)
              It confirmed everything in the minds of
              my parents - that they had taken the right
              course with my younger brother and the
              wrong course with me.  It would have been so
              much easier for everyone if I had slipped away
              that day.  I decided to grant them that wish.


     INT.  HOME.  NIGHT.

     ANTON stands at the mantlepiece in the dimly-lit living room.
     He gazes at a framed family portrait - Vincent's face has been
     torn out of it.  He suddenly spies VINCENT exiting the front
     gate, carrying a suitcase.  Anton goes to shout Vincent's name
     but the words don't get out.


     EXT.  GATTACA.  DAWN.

     A pick-up truck, packed with a CLEANING CREW, pulls into the
     rear of the building.  They are no longer strictly the migrant
     workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of
     ethnicities - all members of a genetic underclass that does not
     discriminate by race.

     As VINCENT exits the truck and turns towards the camera, we
     discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to
     know as JEROME.  The only visible differences are the glasses he
     wears and his hair, still naturally dark.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Like many others in my situation, I moved
              around a lot in the next few years, getting
              work where I could.  I must have cleaned
              half the toilets in the state.

     We follow VINCENT through the course of a day.  Cleaning
     restrooms, toilets, picking up litter, sweeping, washing
     windows - gazing at the AEROSPACE WORKERS below.  The building
     is part of the Gattaca facility, located near a shuttle launch
     site.  Throughout the day, with the regularity of 747's, Vincent
     spies rocket ships in the distance, launching into the sky.
     Jerome's is the only head that turns and looks up.  Long after
     the sun has set, Vincent is still working.  Another rocket ship
     lights up the darkness.  Vincent gazes forlornly into the
     heavens.


     EXT. GATTACA - GLASS WALL.  DAY.

     VINCENT cleans a window from the outside, staring in at the
     arrogant GATTACA EMPLOYEES entering the security channels -
     a smaple taken from their fingertips.  Jerome, in a trance,
     constantly cleans the same spot of glass.  He fails to notice an
     Older Janitor, CAESAR, appear beside him.

                           CAESAR
              When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't
              clean it too well.

                           VINCENT
                      (confused)
              What do you mean?

                           CAESAR
                      (glancing to the Gattaca workers)
              You might get ideas.

                           VINCENT
              But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier
              for you to see me when I'm on the other
              side of it.

     Caesar smiles at Vincent's cockiness.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     VINCENT empties garbage into a dumpster adjacent to Gattaca.
     His attention is drawn to something in the trash.  A discarded
     manual on Celestial Mechanics and Navigation.  He wipes food
     residue off the corner.


     INT.  ASTRONOMY & TELESCOPE SHOP.  DAY.

     A forest of telescopes on tripods in an astronomy shop.  VINCENT
     enters the store with a bucket and squeegee and immediately goes
     to clean the storefront window.  The STORE OWNER looks up from
     his tabloid - "STAR" magazine.

                           OWNER
              Where's Earl?

                           JEROME
              He fell.  Lucky it was only the second floor.

     The owner nods and returns to his magazine.  When he looks up
     again one of his tripods is missing its telescope and Jerome is
     nowhere to be seen.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME returns to his bare apartment.  He removes the cloth
     covering the bucket to reveal a dumpy-shaped telescope snugly
     wedged inside.  He starts to pour over his collection of
     textbooks.  Other tattered space paraphenalia adorns the wall.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Of course the best test score in the world
              wasn't going to get me in the front door
              unless I had the blood test to go with it.


     EXT.  GATTACA.  NIGHT.

     While his fellow WORKERS sit on the steps at the service
     entrance to Gattaca, passing around an unlabeled bottle of clear
     liquor, VINCENT sits some distance away studying his text book.
     In the absence of a computer, he practices typing commands on a
     keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box.

     A tiny, seedy-looking man, GERMAN, forties, appears from
     nowhere and takes a seat beside him.

                           GERMAN
                      (offering his hand)
              Vincent, I'm German--
                      (anticipating Vincent's response)
              That's my name.

     He looks the apprehensive Vincent up and down.

                           VINCENT
              What do you think?

                           GERMAN
                      (shrugs)
              I think I could do something
                      (glancing to the text book)
              provided you know what you're doing
              and you can meet the terms.

     Vincent pulls a plastic e-money card from his overalls.

                           GERMAN
              You got a photo of yourself?

     Vincent produces a snapshot of himself - torn from the family
     portrait.  German feeds the snapshot into the pocket-sized
     computer he carries.  The picture is instantly scanned and
     appears on the computer's small color screen.  German returns
     the photograph and hastily departs.

     CAESAR, the elderly janitor, notices German's exit.

                           CAESAR
                      (to Vincent)
              I thought I told you not to get any ideas.


     High up the side of a building, washing windows, VINCENT pauses
     occasionally to practice typing commands on his cardboard keys -
     viewing a screen in his imagination - or the nightsky itself.
     He hears his name being called.

                           GERMAN
              Vincent...Vincent...

                           VINCENT
                      (staring through his glasses)
              German, is that you?

                           GERMAN
              Vincent, come down.  I've found him.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.  NIGHT.

     GERMAN leads VINCENT through a maze of corridors.

                           JEROME (VO)
              For the genetically superior, success
              is easier to attain but is by no means
              guaranteed.  After all, there is no gene
              for fate.  And when, for one reason or
              another, a member of the elite falls on
              hard times, their genetic identity becomes
              a valued commodity for the unscrupulous.
              One man's loss is another man's gain.

     He gives a conspiratorial nod to another passing DNA BROKER,
     both men carrying their palm-top computers.

                           GERMAN
                      (enthusiastically reading from data on
                      his portable screen as he walks)
              He has the heart of an ox.  He could run
              through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run.
              Actually, he was a big college swimming star.

                           VINCENT
              I hope he's not just a body.

                           GERMAN
              No problem.  Before he dropped out he was
              an honor student, the right majors--

                           VINCENT
              How do I square the accident?

                           GERMAN
                      (still reading data from his
                      palm-top computer)
              It happened in Australasia.  He checked
              in yesterday.  No family complications, no
              record he ever broke his neck.  As far as
              anybody's concerned, he's still a walking,
              talking, fully-productive member of society.
              You just have to get him off the pipe and
              fill in the last two years of his life.
                      (correcting himself)
              Excuse me, your life.

     German has stopped walking as if they have arrived.

                           VINCENT
                      (looking around for a likely
                      candidate but finding none)
              Where is he?

     German reaches towards a PARAPLEGIC sitting in his wheelchair
     in the stairwell directly in front of them, his head slumped, an
     incriminating bong nestled in his lap.  German pulls the man's
     head up by the hair.  EUGENE.  Depsite the patchy, unkempt
     beard and thick glaze over his eyes he bears a striking
     similarity to Vincent.  Vincent holds a mirror beside the face
     of the lethargic Eugene to compare his own reflection.

                           GERMAN
                      (smiling confidently
              What did I tell you?  Which one's the mirror?

                           VINCENT
                      (still not fully convinced)
              That's the hair color in his profile?

     German checks an entry in his computer:  "HAIR: BLONDE"

                           GERMAN
              Yeah.

                           VINCENT
                      (touching his own dark strands)
              I'd have to bleach my hair.

                           GERMAN
                      (irritated, impatient)
              Why are you inventing problems?  You two
              are a couple of goddam clones.  You look
              so right together, I want to double my fee.

                           VINCENT
                      (a thought occurs, addressing the
                      paraplegic for the first time)
              How tall are you?

                           EUGENE
                      (deadpan)
              Four foot six.

     Vincent grins, realizing that Eugene is referring to his seated
     height.  There is an instant connection between the two men.

                           VINCENT
              Okay, how tall did you used to be?

                           EUGENE
                      (apathetic, still under the
                      influence of whatever he's been smoking)
              Six one.

                           VINCENT
                      (to German, disappointed)
              He's too tall.

                           GERMAN
                      (shrugs)
              You can wear lifts.

                           VINCENT
              Even with lifts I'm never that tall.

                           GERMAN
              There's a way.


     INT.  BACKSTREET SURGERY.  NIGHT.

     In a primitive operating theatre, VINCENT lies on a table, his
     lower legs masked off for surgery.  The SURGEON switches on a
     surgical saw and lines it up with handdrawn incision marks.
     Metal struts are ready to elongate his legs.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     GERMAN wheels the dazed EUGENE into the apartment, cluttered
     with space paraphenalia.  One wheel of his rusting wheelchair is
     flimsily held on with wire.  VINCENT follows behind on crutches,
     both lower legs in casts and cross-braces.  Vincent signs the
     contract German puts in front of him.


     EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE A BAR.  DAY.

     EUGENE, glassy-eyed, strides out of a bar, past camera and into
     the street.  We hear a squeal of brakes and a sickening thud.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     EUGENE awakens with a scream, bathed in sweat, arms bound to a
     bed - the only real piece of furniture in the room.  VINCENT,
     sitting on a crate beside him, soaking a towel in a bowl of
     water, is taken by surprise.  Eugene continues to scream and
     thrash, fighting against his bindings.  Vincent stuffs the towel
     into Eugene's mouth and holds onto his arms.

                           JEROME (VO)
              I confess, at first I wondered if I had rescued
              a man who was already dead.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT - BATHROOM.  NIGHT.

     VINCENT holds EUGENE's head over the toilet bowl as he vomits
     violently.  Eugene's paralysis and Vincent's broken legs make
     the operation doubly difficult.

     Finally Eugene has nothing left in his stomach to vomit.  He
     drops to the floor in exhaustion.  Vincent, also exhausted from
     the effort of holding Eugene over the bowl, joins him on the
     broken linoleum.  Both men stare up at the ceiling that carries
     a map of the constellation.

                           VINCENT
              You okay, Jerome?

                           EUGENE
                      (ironically referring to
                      their mutual immobility)
              Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?

     Vincent smiles.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE turns his nose up at the plate of boiled meat and
     potatoes that VINCENT puts in front of him.  Vincent catches the
     look.

                           VINCENT
              What's wrong with it?

                           EUGENE
              I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all,
              you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning
              how to be you.

                           VINCENT
                      (shrugs)
              Suit yourself.

                           EUGENE
                      (trying to be more diplomatic)
              Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful
              --I know you and that little broker--what do you
              call him?

                           VINCENT
              German.

                           EUGENE
              You're both going to a lot of trouble--
                      (trying to be tactful)
              Maybe you can con somebody into believing
              you're me to get your foot in the door--but
              once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm
              sure you're sincere...
                      (glancing to the space paraphenalia)
              ...but I was being groomed for something like
              this myself.  Even without the accident I don't
              think I would have made it.  My point is--how the
              hell do you expect to pull this off?

     Jerome merely stares back as if the thought of failure has never
     occurred to him.

                           VINCENT
                      (shrugs and states it simply)
              I don't know exactly, Jerome.

                           EUGENE
                      (laughing)
              At least you're honest.
                      (a thought occurs)
              Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're
              going to be Jerome, you may as well start
              getting used to it.

     NB:  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SCREENPLAY "VINCENT" IS REFERRED
     TO AS "JEROME".

     INT. HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME looks through Eugene's personal effects, including a
     photograph album.  He is drawn to a swimming medal inside the
     album at a page displaying a photo of a wealthy, austere
     MOTHER - Eugene evidently comes from money.

     Even as he wheels into the room in his rickety wheelchair we see
     that EUGENE has the bearing of someone of good breeding.  He has
     a bag of blood on his lap.  More blood is being drawn from his
     arm through an IV.  Eugene catches Jerome looking at the album.

                           JEROME
                      (guiltily closing the book)
              I have to know where you come from.

                           EUGENE
              If anybody asks, tell them the truth--
              your family disowns you.  You are a
              disappointment, Jerome.

                           JEROME
                      (referring to Eugene's medal, impressed)
              What about this?

                           EUGENE
              Wrong color.  It's silver.
                      (tossing the bag of blood to Jerome)
              It's not easy living up to this.

     Eugene wheels away.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     JEROME practises writing with his right hand, trying to
     replicate Eugene's signature.

                           EUGENE
                      (wheeling by, looking over Jerome's
                      shoulder at the signature)
              It needs work.

                           JEROME
                      (rueful)
              You had to be a right-hander.

                           EUGENE
              Noone orders southpaws anymore.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     A pair of spectacles lie on the bed.  JEROME, still wearing his
     twin casts, sits behind an optometrist's portable examining
     device.  GERMAN hovering in the background, an OPTOMETRIST
     custom-fits JEROME with gossamer thin contact lenses.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Myopia is a dead giveaway - one of the earliest
              and most justifiable of the quality-of-life
              corrections.  Anybody with impaired vision is
              certain to be suffering from all the other
              deficiencies of a "nonadvantaged" birth.

                           GERMAN
                      (inspecting the lens in Jerome's eye)
              It's no good.  I can see an edge.  He may as
              well walk in there with a cane.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     The Optometrist has been replaced in the living room with a
     BLACK MARKET DENTIST who bonds JEROME's small, gapped teeth to
     match EUGENE's perfectly straight, white picket fences.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     Hair already bleached and cut to match Eugene's hairstyle,
     JEROME sits in a chair against a hastily erected white paper
     backdrop.  From his wheelchair, EUGENE puts the finishing
     touches to Jerome's hair.  He wheels himself out of the way.
     The final accomplice in Jerome's deception, a BLACK MARKET
     COMPUTER GRAPHICS DESIGNER, takes Jerome's photo with a video
     camera.  Manipulating the captured image, the Designer morphs
     Jerome's face into the face of Eugene.  The resulting photo that
     spits out of a printer is neither one nor the other but an
     acceptable combination of the two.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     EUGENE is starting to prepare Jerome's specimen bags for the
     first time.  He winces in pain as he plucks several hairs from
     his head.  JEROME, now out of his casts, prepares job
     applications.

                           EUGENE
                      (still grimacing, referring to the follicles)
              You really need that much?

                           JEROME
              More than that.  You'll get used to it.

                           EUGENE
                      (yanking out another hair)
              God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?

                           JEROME
                      (inspecting a hair follicle)
              Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in
              this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star.
              I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.

                           EUGENE
                      (marvelling at Jerome's earnestness)
              God, you're serious, aren't you?

     Jerome ignores him.  Having learnt his lesson, he hands the
     envelopes to EUGENE to lick the flaps.


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  DAY.

     JEROME is doing a late-minute cram on a geriatric computer from
     the late 1990's.  Checking the time, Jerome hurriedly picks up
     the shirt that EUGENE has been ironing from a prone position on
     the floor.

                           JEROME
              It's not too late to back out.

                           EUGENE
              You don't know what a relief it is not to
              be me.  Are you sure you want the job?

     Jerome contemplates the question for a moment.

                           JEROME
              What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the bladder bag he wears)
              Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may
              as well pay my rent.

     Jerome hurrise to the bathroom where, with some difficulty, he
     inserts his urine device for the first time.  The new improved
     Jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview.


     INT.  GATTACA CORPORATION - TESTING LAB.  DAY.

     JEROME emerges from a bathroom and hands a TECHNICIAN his
     plastic cup full of fraudulent urine and inserts it into the
     analyzer.

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (reading off the profile)
              Congratulations.

                           JEROME
                      (perplexed)
              What about the interview?

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (referring to the cup)
              That was it.


     EXT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME, scarcely able to disguise his delight, exits Gattaca,
     trying not to stare at the superb specimens who are now his
     "colleagues".

                           JEROME (VO)
              The majority of people are now made-to-order.
              What began as a means to rid society of
              inheritable diseases has become a way to design
              your offspring--the line between health and
              enhancement blurred forever.  Eyes can always be
              brighter, a voice purer, a mind sharper, a body
              stronger, a life longer.  Everyone seeks to give
              their child the best chance but the most skilled
              geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.

     In a nearby park MODEL CHILDREN from MODEL PARENTS play
     together.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Anyone who is the product of an altered
              DNA is proudly referred to as a "DAN",
              "self-made man or woman", "man-child". 


     INT.  HOUSING PROJECT - APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME wheels EUGENE out of their housing project.  He takes in
     the neighborhood for the last time.  We focus on a POOR COUPLE
     cradling an INFANT.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Those parents who, for moral or, more likely
              economic reasons, refrain from tampering with
              their offspring's genetic makeup or who fail
              to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children
              to a life of routine discrimination.

     We glimpse other PEOPLE in the neighborhood.  They appear poor
     but, for the most part, physically normal.  However a pall of
     gloom hangs over them.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Officially they are called "In-Valids"*.  Also
              known as "godchildren", "men-of-god", "faith births",
              "blackjack births", "deficients", "defectives",
              "genojunk", "ge-gnomes", "the fucked-up people".

     [* "IN-VALID" pronounced as in "an invalid license"]

                           JEROME (VO)
              They are the "healthy ill".  They don't
              actually have anything yet - they may never.
              But since few of the pre-conditions can be
              cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them
              as if they were already sick.

     As they enter a car, driven by GERMAN, Jerome spies a beautiful
     young GIRL, 11, sitting on the steps of the housing project,
     staring forlornly into space.  While there is no outward sign of
     any deficiency, she is somehow aware that she is damaged goods.

     Jerome glances in the rearview mirror.

                           JEROME (VO)
              By means of a donor I have cheated the
              system for the last four years to open doors
              that would otherwise be closed to me.

     Jerome wheels Eugene into the palatial condominium complex where
     the two men now reside.


     INT.  GATTACA.  PRESENT DAY.

     We return to JEROME's reflection in the glass.  Other GATTACA
     EMPLOYEES are gradually gathering behind him.

                           JEROME (VO)
              In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen
              quickly through the ranks of Gattaca.  Only one
              of the Mission Directors has ever come close
              to discovering my true identity.

     We now see what Jerome has been gazing at through the window
     the whole time - the sight that has brought a hush to the
     complex.  Through an open office door lies the body of a large
     man - the MURDERED DIRECTOR, lying where he has just been
     discovered, in a pool of his own blood.

                           JEROME (VO)
              Strange to think, he may have more success
              exposing me in death than he did in life.

     Jerome wipes his eye and also goes to investigate.  We focus on
     an extreme close up of his EYELASH.  Loosened by Jerome's hand,
     it breaks free and floats gently down to the floor where it
     comes to rest.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION.  MORNING.

     DETECTIVE HUGO, late-forties, wearing a crime-scene hygenic suit
     and gloves and a full clear mask - looking more like a surgeon
     or a toxic waste worker than a detective - places a blood-
     spattered computer keyboard alongside the Director's shattered
     skull.  The indentations match the blunt corner of the keyboard.
     Hugo detaches the dangling keyboard from its parent computer and
     seals the likely murder weapon in a marked, transparent plastic
     bag.

     A CREW of similarly-suited homicide detectives systematically
     vacuum the surrounding office area with metallic, industrial-
     looking mini-vacs.  Once each work space has been vacuumed, the
     transparent plastic vacuum bag is detached, sealed and labelled.

     OTHER DETECTIVES video the scene with camcorders.  Video prints
     spit out of the cameras for instant inspection.


     EXT.  GATTACA - LANDSCAPED GARDENS.  DAY.

     A silicon police tape cordons off the crime scene.  From the
     landscaped garden, a crowd of GATTACA EMPLOYEES view the
     proceedings through the glass walls.

                           EMPLOYEE 1
                      (staring at the Director's body)
              Awful.

                           EMPLOYEE 2
              Yeah, awful it didn't happen sooner.

     Nervous smirks from nearby employees.  We focus on JEROME.
     Standing slightly apart from the others, he does not appear to
     share the joke, or perhaps even hear it.  Jerome watches, wide-
     eyed, as a DETECTIVE approaches his work station with a mini-
     vac.  A chill goes through Jerome as the detective's cleaner
     passes over his desk.

     Jerome is distracted by a smear on the window, obstructing his
     view.  Without thinking, he breathes on the glass and rubs the
     smear away with his elbow.  Nearby, elderly janitor, CAESAR
     notices Jerome's fastidious act and reads the panic in Jerome's
     eyes.  DIRECTOR JOSEF suddenly appears at Jerome's shoulder.
     Standing a pace behind the Director, computer notepad in hand,
     is IRENE.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              You're lucky to be getting out of this.

                           JEROME
              We're still going ahead as planned?

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              The launch window is only open until week's
              end.  Tragic though this event may be, it
              hasn't stopped the planets turning.

     He glances towards a group of Detectives headed by HUGO.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              You'll have to excuse me, Jerome.  I have to
              meet with the authorities--naturally, we're
              co-operating in any way, although I won't
              tolerate a major disruption.
                      (as he departs)
              I wish I was going with you, Jerome.

     As the pair depart, Jerome and Irene exchange a glance.  Irene
     is also aware of Jerome's unease.


     INT.  GATTACA - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

     We focus on JEROME's eyelash, still lying on the floor.
     A huge crescent-shaped hair that fills the screen.  Suddenly
     there is a roar of a mini-vac and the eyelash is sucked up.  We
     follow the eyelash's journey, down the throat of the cleaner
     into the specimen bag where it is sucked against the bag's
     clear, plastic wall.


     INT.  GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     The DIRECTOR's corpse is sealed in a plastic bodybag and wheeled
     away on a gurney.  The blood and other body matter from the
     murder scene is sucked up by a portable wet-vac and the sample
     bag appropriately labeled.


     EXT.  GATTACA - COURTYARD CAFETERIA.  DAY

     A chime sounds over the P.A. follwed by an announcement.

                           ANNOUNCER (OC)
              Thank you for your co-operation.  Please
              return to your work stations immediately.

     The PROGRAMMERS get to their feet en masse and begin filing into
     the work room.

                           EMPLOYEE 3
                      (sarcastic aside)
              What, no counselling?


     INT.  GATTACA COMPUTER COMPLEX - DIRECTOR'S OFFICE.  DAY.

     A WOMAN ASSISTANT whose keyboard was used in the attack has to
     pause as a MAINTENANCE WORKER gives her work station a final
     spray to return it to its former pristine condition.  A new
     keyboard is plugged into her monitor to replace the one taken as
     evidence.


     INT.  GATTACA COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     JEROME opens his desk drawer to check his comb, now plucked
     completely clean.  He carefully places two of Eugene's hairs to
     the comb and scatters another bag of fraudulent matter around
     his work station.


     INT.  GATTACA - SIMULATOR ROOM.  DAY.

     In a large, bare room a simulator does a slow dance back and
     forth on its hydralic legs, miming the path of the space
     craft Jerome will soon be aboard.  The simulation ends and
     JEROME exits the simulator through a small door.  IRENE
     hesitantly approaches, carrying a slim electronic tablet.

                           IRENE
              Excuse me, Jerome.  I'm sorry to bother you.

     Jerome turns, not displeased by the interruption.

                           JEROME
              No bother.

                           IRENE
                      (referring to her notepad)
              I've been asked to compile a log for the
              investigators--they want to know everyone's
              whereabouts last night.

                           JEROME
              Last night?  I was at home.

     Irene makes a note with her stylus.

                           IRENE
              Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?

                           JEROME
              No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.

     Irene makes another note.

                           JEROME
                      (wry smile)
              Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about
              you?  Where were you last night?

                           IRENE
              I was at home.

                           JEROME
              Were you alone?

                           IRENE
                      (hesitant)
              Yes.

                           JEROME
                      (teasing)
              So we don't know for sure about you, either.

                           IRENE
                      (wary, wondering where the
                      conversation is headed)
              No.

                           JEROME
              Why don't we say we were together?

                           IRENE
                      (confused)
              Why would we do that?

                           JEROME
              I have better things to do this week than
              answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot.
              Don't you?

     Irene contemplates the question.

                           JEROME
                      (gently pressing)
              Well, shall we say we spent the evening together?

     Irene is still unsure whether or not Jerome is serious.

                           IRENE
              To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to know
              what that was like.

     Irene turns and departs.  Jerome watches her go.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     The paraplegic EUGENE, seated by the window, meticulously cuts
     a long fingernail into numerous clippings.  He places the
     clippings in small plastic bags and seals them.  He then begins
     to fill tiny sachets with blood.  He turns as he hears JEROME
     enter down the spiral staircase with the groceries.

                           EUGENE
              You didn't forget the truffles?

     JEROME places the items in the refrigerator in the bathroom and
     retrieves a bottle of vodka - the vodka incongruous-looking
     beside the blood and urine specimens.  Joining Eugene at his
     workbench, he pours them both a drink.

                           EUGENE
                      (sensing something amiss, trying
                      to keep his humor)
              Who died?

                           JEROME
              The Mission Director.

                           EUGENE
                      (misinterpreting the deadpan remark)
              You wish.

                           JEROME
              They found him in his office this morning--
              beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.

     Eugene takes in the news, a smile broadening across his face.

                           EUGENE
              What an act of benevolence--a service to the
              community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing
              between you and ignition.

                           JEROME
              He was still warm when they confirmed.

                           EUGENE
                      (confused by Jerome's attitude)
              This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?

                           JEROME
              The place is crawling with Hoovers.

                           EUGENE
              So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?

     Jerome shoots him a glance for the inappropriate remark.

                           JEROME
              That's not the point.

                           EUGENE
                      (scoffing)
              Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the
              "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--
                      (glancing up to the night sky)
              you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.
                      (gently chiding)
              Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.

                           JEROME
                      (still tempering Eugene's enthusiasm)
              You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got
              my final physical tomorrow.

     Jerome wheels Eugene's chair to a specially constructed platform
     that allows the wheels to spin in mid-air.  Jerome tapes an
     electrode to Eugene's chest and attaches the wire to a slim
     recording device.  Eugene begins to spin the wheel of the chair
     faster and faster.  Jerome monitors Eugene's steady heartbeat
     through a set of headphones.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  NIGHT.

     The complex is virtually empty - only a handful of the hundreds
     of PROGRAMMERS working late into the night.  IRENE approaches
     JEROME's work station on the pretext of delivering some
     documents.  Trying to act casually, she looks under the papers
     on his desk, then opens the top desk drawer.

     We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of the comb lying there - the two
     hairs trapped between the teeth of the comb.  Irene removes one
     of the follicles and drops it into an envelope she is carrying.


     INT.  24-HOUR SEQUENCING LAB.  NIGHT.

     "SEQUENCING-WHILE-U-WAIT".  Similar to a 1-hour photo lab, the
     store - little more than a booth - displays a price list on the
     wall.  "FULL SEQUENCE - $80".  IRENE waits in line with a cross-
     section of other CUSTOMERS.  She checks the contents of the
     envelope that contains the hair.

     The YOUNG WOMAN in line ahead of her allows the TECHNICIAN to
     take a swab from her full lips with a Q-tip.

                           TECHNICIAN
              How old?

                           YOUNG WOMAN
                      (confused)
              Me?

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (mustering patience, referring
                      to the Q-tip)
              The specimen.

                           YOUUNG WOMAN
                      (proudly)
              I kissed him five minutes ago.  A real good one.

     Overhearing, several PEOPLE in the line snicker.

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (long-suffering)
              I'll see what I can do.

     The technician hands the swab to an ASSISTANT.  The Young Woman
     is handed a number and takes a seat.  Irene hands her envelope
     over the counter.  She too is handed a number.  We follow
     Jerome's follicle as another TECHNICIAN places it in an
     analyzing machine.


     INT/EXT.  SEQUENCING LAB / PARKING LOT.  NIGHT.

     The TECHNICIAN returns the envelope to IRENE along with a
     miniature compact disc.

                           TECHNICIAN
                      (remarking on the profile result)
              9.4...very nice.

     Irene does not appear to share the technician's enthusiasm.
     She emerges from the sequencing lab and enters her car.  Taking
     a palm-top computer from her purse, she inserts the disc into
     the computer.  Jerome's counterfeit genetic profile appears on
     the screen.  The details confirm her worst fears.


     EXT.  MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and EUGENE, dressed to the nines, pull up in the car
     to a darkened doorway in a poorly lit street.  A VALET appears
     out of the shadows.  Familiar with the car, he goes immediately
     to the trunk to retrieve Eugene's collapsible wheelchair.
     Jerome tips the valet - a credit card wiped through a device.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB.  NIGHT.

     The chic, elegant establishment inside belies its darkened
     exterior.  JEROME wheels EUGENE into a decadent dinner club
     full of an odd assortment of people.  They are immediately
     greeted respectfully by MICHAEL, the owner and maitre d'.
     Jerome and Eugene are obviously regulars.

                           MICHAEL
              Good evening, gentlemen.  Your table is ready.
                      (referring to Jerome's mission)
              Not long now, sir.  You'll be upstairs
              before you know it.  We're going to miss you.

                           JEROME
              Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff.
              I'd like to take one of your chefs with me.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S DINNER CLUB.  NIGHT.

     In a secluded booth JEROME and EUGENE toast from a bottle of
     1999 vintage Bordeaux.  Eugene drinks longer than Jerome.
     Jerome dabs his mouth with a napkin.  He fails to notice a
     minute FLAKE OF SKIN dislodged from his chin.  We follow the
     flake as it comes to rest beneath the table.

     LATER, Eugene and Jerome watch COUPLES dancing a samba on the
     dance floor.  A WAITER vacuums the table with a discreet,
     handheld miniature vacuum while a WAITRESS clears the plates.
     She accidentally drops a knife onto Eugene's leg.

                           WAITRESS
                      (aghast at the sight of his lifeless legs)
              I'm so sorry.  Did I hurt you?

                           EUGENE
                      (smiling, a trace of bitterness)
              Honey, if you'd hurt me, I'd be cured.

     Eugene, the worse for drink, gropes for the waitress's leg but
     she easily avoids his clumsy pass.

                           EUGENE
              You want to meet a real-life spaceman?

     Jerome, always aware, scanning the club, suddenly spies
     NAPOLEON, his Gattaca colleague, on the other side of the
     room.  Napoleon is taking a hit from a vial concealed in his
     hand.  Jerome abruptly turns his back to avoid being recognized.

                           JEROME
              Let's get out of here.

                           EUGENE
                      (knocking back his drink,
                      misinterpreting the hasty departure)
              You're right, there's more atmosphere
              where you're going.


     INT/EXT.  CAR.  NIGHT.

     Driving along the freeway, Jerome's car suddenly dives down an
     escape road.  EUGENE looks sideways at JEROME.

                           JEROME
              You drive.


     INT/EXT.  CAR.  NIGHT.

     The car careens around and around a small circular building -
     a cloud of dust billowing up behind the car.  We focus on a
     BRICK wedged against the car's gas pedal.

     EUGENE is at the wheel, JEROME in the passenger seat.

     The hard turn is repeated with increasing recklessness, Eugene
     fighting to control the bucking car.

                           EUGENE
                      (screaming in both fear and exhilaration)
              I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!

                           JEROME
              Keep going!!  Keep going!!

     Finally the car spins to a halt in a cloud of dust.  When the
     dust settles it is revealed that they have been circling the
     base of a huge satellite dish in a desolate location.


     EXT.  SATELLITE DISH.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE lies on the hood of the car, leaning against the
     windshield, drinking from a bottle of vodka.  In the
     background, the unmanned satellite dish.  JEROME relieves
     himself against the building at the base of the satellite.

                           EUGENE
                      (gently chiding Jerome over the joyride)
              You idiot.  You could ruin everything
              with a stunt like that.

     Eugene spies a spacecraft launching from Gattaca city.

                           EUGENE
                      (gazing up into the night sky)
              At least up there your piss will be worth something.
                      (smiling at the thought)
              You'll all be showering in it, right?

                           JEROME
                      (zipping his fly)
              And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the
              time it's filtered.

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the rocket ship)
              What is that one?

     Jerome doesn't bother to look in the direction of the craft but
     merely glances to his watch.  He joins Eugene on the hood of the
     car.

                           JEROME
                      (looking at his watch)
              11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.

                           EUGENE
              How long do you stay up there before you go?

                           JEROME
              A day or so.

                           EUGENE
                      (beaming)
              I still can't believe they're sending you to
              the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be
              born, on a mission to discover the origin
              of life.

     Eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to Jerome.

                           JEROME
              You should be going instead of me.

     Jerome taps Eugene's lifeless legs with his foot.

                           JEROME
              Up there they wouldn't be a problem.

                           EUGENE
                      (glancing heavenwards, shaking his head)
              You know I'm scared of heights.


     INT.  CRIME LABORATORY - AUTOPSY ROOM.  NIGHT.

     The body and clothing of the MISSION DIRECTOR, lying on a metal
     examining table is scanned with a blue-light magnifying
     instrument.  Fingernail specimens are taken for analysis.  In
     another area of the laboratory, the labelled vacuum bags are
     attached to analyzers and the contents sucked out and
     automatically identified.  ID names and photographs of GATTACA
     EMPLOYEES begin appearing on a computer screen at high speed
     along with other personal details - all data automatically
     logged for later review.

     The photographs and personal details of JEROME and IRENE flash
     past, amongst the faces of other employees.

     We focus on a magnified close up of JEROME'S EYELASH, still
     clinging stubbornly to the side of its specimen bag.  We
     continue to follow its journey as it is finally sucked into the
     analyzer.


     INT.  CRIME LAB - ANALYZER MACHINE.  NIGHT.

     Inside the machine, a minute, cell-thin sliver is sliced from
     JEROME'S EYELASH and analyzed.


     INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S CRIME LAB.  NIGHT.

     A severed HUMAN TONGUE sits on a tray in a sterile, sealed
     chamber.  Using gloves that protrude through the chamber's glass
     wall, face buried in a binocular eyepiece, the INVESTIGATOR
     takes a swab from the tongue.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to the tongue, as he inserts the
                      tip of the swab into an analyzer)
              Let's see what you've got to say for yourself.

     A FEMALE ASSISTANT, looking on, hardly has time to smile at the
     remark before information begins to appear on a nearby computer
     terminal.  The computer gradually builds a portrait of the owner
     of the tongue using genetic predictors.  The Investigator
     wanders over to the window as his Assistant reads the
     information from the screen.

                           ASSISTANT
              The tongue is male.  Mature.  Blonse hair.
              Brown eyes.  Light complexion.  Between
              5'11 and 6'1.  Pronounced Caucasian nose.
              Thin lips.  Weak chin.  Lobeless ears.
              Prematurely balding.  Slightly bow-legged.
              Broad shoulders.  Barrel chest...
                      (pause)
              Blind.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (interest piqued)
              Blind?
                      (mildly amused, checking the
                      monitor for himself)
              The tongue is blind?

                           ASSISTANT
                      (confused)
              Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shrugs)
              Someone who is mindful that the blind
              still speak.

     The INVESTIGATOR is alerted by the chime of his nearby computer.
     On the screen, he discovers the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT
     and the accompanying flashing message: TRACKING IN-VALID
     883000181105-10  - NEW DATA -


     INT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX - PARKING GARAGE.  NIGHT.

     Having plugged his car into an overnight charger, JEROME pushes
     EUGENE in his wheelchair to the elevator.  Bottle in hand,
     Eugene leans over and vomits on the ground.  Jerome shakes his
     head resignedly.  Eugene looks drunkenly up at Jerome.

                           EUGENE
                      (sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit)
              I'm sorry.  Did you want it?

     Jerome meets Eugene's gaze.  There is a trace of bitterness
     in Eugene's drunken smile.

                           EUGENE
              Let me get it for you.

     Eugene bends down to scoop up some vomit with his hand but the
     elevator arrives and Jerome quickly wheels him away.  Eugene's
     head flops to the side as he passes out.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME unlocks EUGENE's condo and wheels his chair inside.  We
     see their reflection in a full-length mirror as Jerome pushes
     Eugene to the bedroom.  After removing Eugene's soiled clothing,
     he heaves the tall man from the chair and onto the bed.

                           EUGENE
                      (maudlin, sobbing like a child)
              I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

                           JEROME
                      (attempting to comfort)
              It's okay, Eugene.

                           EUGENE
              You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was
              doing when I walked in front of that car--

                           JEROME
              --What car?--Go to sleep.

                           EUGENE
              --I walked right in front of it.  I was never
              more sober in my life.

     Jerome looks at Eugene's lifeless legs, trying to cover his
     shock at the revelation.

                           JEROME
              It's all right.

                           EUGENE
                      (grabbing Jerome by the collar)
              I'm proud of you, Vincent.

     Eugene's head falls back onto the pillow.

                           JEROME
                      (smiling to himself)
              You must be drunk to call me Vincent.

     But Eugene does not reply, drifting into sleep once again.
     Jerome pulls a blanket over him.

     On the verge of leaving, Jerome's attention is drawn to a wall
     on the far side of the room.  Approaching the wall, near
     Eugene's mirrored closet, he detects a faint mechanical whir
     coming from inside the adjacent condominium.  Jerome
     contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead
     - climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME fastidiously vacuums with an upright cleaner.  Using a
     hose attachment he cleans around a picture frame that contains
     Jerome's original computer keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a
     cardboard box.


     INT. GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     In the vast room of COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS we pull-focus to
     discover that we have been filming the complex through the
     transparent specimen bag containing JEROME'S EYELASH.

     On the mezzanine floor overlooking the scene of the crime,
     the INVESTIGATOR holds the bag, transfixed by the lash.  The
     lead homicide detective, DETECTIVE HUGO, finishes interviewing
     a GATTACA SECURITY GUARD and approaches the Investigator.
     A large telescope in the background.

     Although Hugo is deferential to his more youthful superior, his
     body language betrays his displeasure.  Hugo clearly does not
     relish the Investigator's involvement in his case.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              I don't understand why you were dragged out
              here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your
              time--a no-nothing case like this.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (gently rebuking his subordinate)
              A man's dead, Detective.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log,
              alibis, grudges...

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Grudges?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (looking out over the balcony)
              I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes.
              The Director was not...
                      (searching for the words)
              ...universally loved.  He was leading the
              cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at
              a room full of motives.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shaking his head adamantly,
                      referring to the bag in his hand)
              No, this is your man.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (not so convinced)
              With respect, Sir--it may be the only
              unaccountable specimen but the profile
              suggests--

                           INVESTIGATOR
              --What about his profile?

     Hugo refers to a print-out of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT's profile
     including his Genetic Quotient.  (The fifteen-year-old photo of
     Vincent now bears little resemblance to his assumed identity.)

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital
              heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen
              has been here but there's an 80 percent chance
              the owner of that eyelash has already died
              himself from natural causes.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (terse)
              So there's a 20 percent chance he's not dead.

     Detective Hugo goes to comment further, then revises his
     remark in his head before speaking.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Even if this Vincent Luca is alive, is it
              likely he could bludgeon a man to death?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              No.  Not likely.

     The Investigator's tone suggests that the identity of the
     culprit is no longer a matter for debate.  There is an awkward
     pause before the Detective falls into step with his superior.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              I take it you're thinking along the lines of a
              robbery gone sour--a thief disturbed in the act?

     The Investigator merely shrugs.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (skeptical)
              Of course that doesn't jibe with what we
              found.  This was an angry killing.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (glancing to the profile in Hugo's hand)
              Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile
              indicates a proclivity for violence.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (trying to appear co-operative)
              I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for
              any family or associate connections--

                           INVESTIGATOR
              --I've already run it.  There's no record
              of any living relative.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              What a pity.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (irritated, glancing to the sample bag)
              Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and
              found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's
              minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.

     We focus on JEROME at his work station.  Although he continues
     to work, he clrarly feels the presence of the INVESTIGATORS on
     the mezzanine floor behind him.

     A MEDICAL DIRECTOR approaches the programmer in the neighboring
     work station - NAPOLEON, the programmer Jerome encountered in
     the nightclub the previous evening.

                           MEDICAL DIRECTOR
              Napoleon, you're late for your substance test.

     Napoleon looks up, ashen-faced.  Jerome intervenes.

                           JEROME
              Director, Napoleon's helping me today.

     The Director regards both men suspiciously.

                           MEDICAL DIRECTOR
              Well, you take it for him, Jerome.

     The Medical Director departs.  Napoleon, stunned by the
     reprieve, approaches Jerome's work station and pretends to
     study the program on his computer screen.

                           NAPOLEON
              Why did you do that?

                           JEROME
                      (exiting to the testing lab)
              Don't worry about it.


     INT.  GATTACA - TESTING LAB.  DAY.

     From behind we observe JEROME standing in front of LAMAR,
     issuing forth his steady stream of fraudulent urine.


     EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - WORKOUT CENTER.  DAY.

     Twenty GATTACA EMPLOYEES, identically-outfitted men and women,
     run in a perfectly straight line towards the tranquil lake of
     the picturesque grounds, never getting any closer to their goal.
     They run at a steady 10mph on twenty identical state-of-the-art
     treadmill machines sunken into the floor and arranged in a
     uniform row facing a floor to ceiling window.  The strain is
     beginning to show on many of the faces.  The heartrate of each
     employee is monitored via a wireless electrode attached to the
     chest.

     Outside in the sunshine the next batch of twenty EMPLOYEES
     limbers up in readiness for their physical.  JEROME's only
     preparation consists of thoughtfully dragging on a
     cigarette while staring out at the man-made lake.  His
     nonchalant attitude disheartens nearby colleagues, including
     IRENE who is amongst a group of workers excused from the run
     by benevolent, over-protective TRAINERS.

                           TRAINER
              You're excused, Irene.  You may resume your duties.

     On the way into the work-out facility Jerome stubs out his
     cigarette in a stainless steel ashtray.  Only we are aware of
     the slim credit card-sized recording device that he furtively
     slips out of his cigarette pack and secrets in his hand.  As he
     takes his place on one of the treadmills and adheres the
     cordless electrode to his chest, Jerome surreptitiously attaches
     his device to the underside of the running machine's control
     panel.


     INT.  GATTACA - WORK-OUT OBSERVATION ROOM.  DAY.

     From a mezzanine floor above the work-out room, LAMAR, the
     medical officer, monitors computer read-outs displaying the
     pace and pulse of the runners on each treadmill machine.


     INT. GATTACA - WORK-OUT CENTER.  DAY.

     One by one the GATTACA EMPLOYEES drop out until JEROME is the
     sole remaining runner.  Several of the other employees stand
     around and watch Jerome run as they towel off.

     He appears under little duress, staring directly ahead,
     seemingly in a trance.  As we focus on his chest, only we are
     aware of the sound of his furiously pounding heart making a lie
     of his calm exterior.


     INT.  GATTACA - WORK-OUT OBSERVATION ROOM.  DAY.

     Jerome's heart registers a far more measured beat on the
     computer in the observation room.  The DIRECTOR is at LAMAR's
     shoulder, beaming proudly.

                           LAMAR
                      (marveling at Jerome's heartrate)
              Six miles later it's still beating like a
              Goddamn metronome.  I could play piano by that
              heartbeat of his.

     The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO enter the observation room,
     escorted by IRENE.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Director Josef, this is our lead Investigator.

     The two men exchange a polite handshake.  However the
     Investigator is immediately taken with the SOLE RUNNER with his
     back to him, on the treadmill below.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              How often do you test, Director?

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              Often.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (intrigued)
              Surely you know what you have.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we
              can hardly turn the boat around.

     On the treadmill below, Jerome glances to his watch as he runs,
     the distress starting to show.  Caught up in the conversation,
     Lamar has forgotten to end the work-out.  Remembering, he
     finally presses the "WARM-DOWN" button, slowing the treadmill.

                           LAMAR
                      (still marveling at Jerome)
              I swear if I went to lunch and came back, he'd
              still be there.

     We focus on Jerome's recording device attached to the bottom of
     the control panel.  It clicks to a stop, indicating that the
     bogus heartbeat recording has ended before the workout.

     The heartbeat monitor in the observation room suddenly races
     from 80 to 250 beats per minute.  Lamar catches the discrepancy
     out of the corner of his eye but before he can take a second
     look, Jerome has whipped his electrode from his chest.  The
     physician shrugs it off as a glitch in the machine.

     The Investigator has turned his back on Jerome to face the
     Director.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              We believe we have a suspect.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              What a relief.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (referring to the profile of VINCENT
                      on Hugo's computer notepad)
              This unaccountable specimen was found in
              the south wing corridor.

     In the room below, Jerome nonchalantly steps off the treadmill,
     stealthily retrieves the recording device from beneath the
     control panel and returns it to his cigarette pack.

     He casually wipes off drops of sweat from the machine with a
     towel, briefly glances to Irene with the Investigators and exits
     to the locker room.

     The Director idly regards the image of VINCENT on Hugo's
     handheld screen.  He does not recognize the face.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              An age enhancement is being prepared as
              we speak.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (referring to his assistant)
              Irene will make it available to security.


     INT.  GATTACA - LOCKER ROOM.  DAY.

     JEROME wears his assured smile all the way along the corridor
     and into the now empty locker room.  He exchanges a cheery
     greeting with an exiting COLLEAGUE, enters a shower stall,
     closes the door behind him and promptly collapses on the shower
     stall floor.

     The effects of the gruelling work-out are only now apparent.  No
     longer sucking up the pain, he gulps air into his oxygen-starved
     lungs, his heart looking for a way through his tightened chest.
     He writhes in agony on the white-tiled floor - a brutal reminder
     of the physical frailty he seeks to disguise.


     EXT.  GATTACA - GARDEN.  LUNCHTIME.

     In Gattaca's perfectly landscaped gardens JEROME, dressed and
     recovered from his ordeal, joins his COLLEAGUES for lunch at one
     of the umbrella-covered tables.  While most of the others pick
     at unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication,
     Jerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray.

     The sight of the juicy steak is greeted with envious looks from
     his colleagues.  Jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by
     liberally sprinkling salt onto the meat.

     However when Jerome looks over towards IRENE, she avoids eye
     contact.  When she abruptly gets up and leaves, Jerome follows -
     thinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby
     trashcan.  A janitor reaches for the napkin.  It is the Old
     Janitor, CAESAR, from Jerome's former life.

                           CAESAR
              I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow.

     The two men exchange a conspiratorial smile.


     EXT.  GATTACA - WIND FARM.  AFTERNOON.

     A forest of wind turbines, supplying energy to the aerospace
     complex.  However the blades of the turbines are motionless in
     the still afternoon.  JEROME finally catches up with IRENE.  She
     turns, unsurprised by his appearance.  Standing beside her, he
     looks out over the complex as if he too has come for the view.

                           JEROME
                      (eyes fixed on the view)
              We were looking at each other.  You stopped.

     Irene, also keeps her gaze ahead.

                           IRENE
              I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.

                           JEROME
                      (shrugging as if it makes
                      no difference to him)
              We were just looking.

                           IRENE
              I know about you.

     Jerome turns to her, startled, trying to read her face.  Irene
     takes a deep breath and abruptly plucks a long, dark hair from
     her head.

                           IRENE
                      (offering the hair to Jerome)
              Here, take it.

     Jerome, confused, takes the hair - more in reflex than intent.

                           IRENE
                      (a challenge)
              If you're still interested, let me know.

     Jerome contemplates the hair in his fingers for a moment, then
     deliberately lets it fall to the grounf.

                           JEROME
                      (never taking his eyes from her)
              Sorry, the wind caught it.

     Irene meets his gaze.  There is not a breath of wind.  The
     hair lies, plainly visible on the ground.


     EXT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE COMPLEX.  AFTERNOON.

     As JEROME and IRENE walk between the wind turbines, Jerome
     pretends not to notice that Irene keeps furtively checking the
     pulse on her wrist.  They pause in the shade.

                           JEROME
                      (as if making conversation)
              Have they found our friend?

                           IRENE
              Friend?

                           JEROME
                      (shrugs)
              It was a mercy-killing after all.

                           IRENE
              They found an eyelash.

                           JEROME
              Where?

                           IRENE
              In the South Wing.

                           JEROME
              Does it have a name?

                           IRENE
              Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--
                      (trying to come up with the last name)
              --somebody.

     Jerome turns away to disguise his alarm.  He quickly recovers.

                           JEROME
              Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.

                           IRENE
                      (a smile playing around her lips)
              You celebrate, Jerome?


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDO.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE talks irritably on the phone, examining a container from
     a newly opened case of hair bleach.

                           EUGENE
                      (into phone)
              --I know what I ordered.  I ordered "Honey
              Dawn" and you sent me "Summer Wheat".

     JEROME descends the staircase, taking the steps two at a time.
     He immediately goes to the refrigerator, removing trays of
     samples.  Eugene abruptly hangs up the phone.

                           JEROME (OC)
              Call German.

                           EUGENE
              Any particular reason?

                           JEROME
                      (collecting up sample bags from
                      the work bench)
              We can't stay here.

                           EUGENE
              What are you talking about?

                           JEROME
              They think I offed the Director.

     Eugene wheels himself over to Jerome, unconcerned.

                           EUGENE
              What makes them think that?

                           JEROME
              They found my eyelash.

                           EUGENE
                      (a flicker of anxiety)
              Where?

                           JEROME
              In a corridor.

                           EUGENE
                      (blasÈ once again)
              Could be worse.  They could have found
              it in your eye.

     Jerome half-smiles despite the situation.

                           JEROME
                      (resuming his collection of samples)
              Come on--we're taking off.

                           EUGENE
              I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go.
              Not on your life--

                           JEROME
              --You don't understand, they'll make the
              connection, they'll hoover again.  We should
              cut our losses.

                           EUGENE
                      (angrily grabbing a tray from Jerome's hands)
              Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting
              like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash
              to you.  They won't believe that one of their
              elite navigators could have suckered them for the
              last five years.

                           JEROME
              They'll recognize me.

                           EUGENE
                      (scoffing)
              How could they recognize you?
                      (referring to the torn photo of
                      20-year-old Vincent on the wall)
              I don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a
              choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession,
              turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out--
              find out what we can but change nothing.  This is
              a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken
              worse heat than this.
                      (angry now)
              Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go
              belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I
              wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me
              now.  I've put too much into this.
                      (returning the samples to the fridge)
              Besides, this stuff is mine.  I had other offers,
              you know.  I could have rented myself out to
              somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in
              there and finish the job myself?
                      (meeting Jerome's gaze)
              We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like
              we planned.

     Jerome slumps down in a chair, Eugene's tirade starting to get
     to him.

                           EUGENE
              And keep your lashes on your lids where
              they belong.  How could you be so careless?

                           JEROME
              I'm sorry.
                      (reluctant admission)
              I think I was crying.

     Eugene is uncomfortable at the notion.

                           EUGENE
              Well save those tears.

     Jerome shrugs awkwardly and pours them both a drink.

                           JEROME
              You really had other offers?

                           EUGENE
                      (shrugs)
              I'm sure I could have.


     INT. CONDOMINIUM - INCINERATOR.  NIGHT.

     The naked JEROME scrapes away at his skin with even greater
     ferocity than usual.  After exiting the incinerator, he deposits
     all the incriminating trash he has collected during the day into
     the furnace and ignites the gas.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     From outside, a car horn sounds.  JEROME, in a formal suit and
     spectacles, abruptly enters the condominium.  He goes to a
     closet and starts searching through Eugene's clothes.

                           JEROME
              Mind if I borrow a tie?

     EUGENE is more interested in the car parked outside the
     condominium.  IRENE sits in a convertible Citroen DS, dressed in
     a classic but provocative black suit.  Unaware that she is being
     observed she touches up her lipstick in the rearview mirror.

                           EUGENE
              So it's not just the Hoovers who've got
              you rattled.

                           JEROME
              You're the one who said not to change anything.
              She's my ear to the investigation.

                           EUGENE
                      (skeptical)
              Is that all?

                           JEROME
              I've got enough on my mind without that.

                           EUGENE
              If you say so.
                      (referring to the ties in Jerome's hand)
              The stripe.

                           JEROME
                      (agreeing with the selection)
              Good choice.

     Jerome fumbles with the knot.  From his chair, Eugene knots
     Jerome's tie for him.  Jerome is intrigued that for once Eugene
     is abstaining - he has not touched his drink.

                           JEROME
              Not thirsty?
                      (referring to the fridge)
              We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.

                           EUGENE
              I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still
              drunk from last night.

                           JEROME
              Never stopped you before.
                      (regarding Eugene's head)
              And for God's sake stop plucking your hair.
              Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure
              you wouldn't go bald.

                           EUGENE
              If I were you I'd worry about myself.
                      (nodding to Jerome's spectacles)
              Haven't you forgotten something?

     Jerome pockets the spectacles and enters the bathroom for his
     contact lenses.  The horn sounds outside the window a second
     time and Jerome hastily exits.  We stay with Eugene.  Irene
     catches a glimpse of him before he moves away from the window.
     Jerome emerges from the building.

     As the couple drive away, Eugene wheels himself to the full
     length mirror.  He regards his own reflection for a moment and
     opens the mirror - a disguised door opening into the adjacent
     apartment.  A cloud of condensed water vapor billows out.
     GERMAN, the DNA Broker, emerges with an ENGINEER.

     He sends the engineer on his way and joins Eugene at his desk.
     Eugene hands German a credit card that he wipes through his
     computer.

                           GERMAN
              We still need to overhaul the back-up generator.
                      (fixing Eugene with a penetrating stare)
              What's going on, Eugene, I thought he was going
              away, not you--you going on vacation?

                           EUGENE
                      (looking away)
              You got it, German.

                           GERMAN
                      (nodding thoughtfully)
              You deserve it.


     INT. CONCERT HALL - AUDITORIUM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and IRENE step over feet, apologizing as they go,
     eventually finding their seats in a box in a sold-out concert
     hall.

     On the stage below, a YOUNG PIANIST - a teenage prodigy - has
     already taken his place at the keys of a grand piano.  The
     pianist removes his white gloves and begins to play - an
     extremely complex and beautiful piece we have never heard
     before.  IRENE looks to JEROME.  He is clearly caught up in the
     music.


     EXT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT.  NIGHT.

     The music from the piano recital continues under the following
     contrasting action.  A huge, brooding housing project.  PEOPLE
     hang around on street corners.  Menace in the air - a feeling of
     impending violence.

     Suddenly unmarked police cars appear from all directions,
     blocking any escape route.  Dozens of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES
     pour out of the cars and onto the street.

     People scatter, many running straight into the arms of the
     Detectives.  OTHERS, spilling out of the housing project, are
     also immediately apprehended.

     The Detectives quickly weed out those suspects not fitting
     Jerome's description - WOMEN, OLD MEN and TEENAGERS.  They are
     shepherded off the street.  A line of IN-VALIDS is formed
     several hundred yards long.  Detectives begin to laboriously
     move along the line, taking finger-prick blood samples from each
     suspect - instantly confirming their identities with portable
     analyzers worn on their hips.

     As if having the idea at the same time, TWO SEPARATE MEN
     suddenly bolt from the line, knowing that their blood will
     incriminate them.  Other Detectives, watching for such escape
     attempts, esaily apprehend them and escort them to a waiting
     police van.

     With the raid under control, DETECTIVE HUGO indicates to the
     INVESTIGATOR that it is safe to exit his car.  The Investigator
     appears irritated, only half-glancing at the TWO MEN already in
     custody, apparently certain that neither one is his suspect.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (enthusiastic)
              Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net.

     The Investigator clearly does not share Hugo's enthusiasm.  The
     Detective offers the Investigator an age enhanced photograph,
     computer-generated from the last existing photo of VINCENT as
     a 20-year-old.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              This is the age enhancement we're working with.

     The Investigator ignores the photo, preferring instead to trust
     his own eye as he wanders along the line of suspects.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (referring to the line-up)
              As you requested, we've kept the parameters
              wider than usual.

     The MEN they scrutinize are hardly mutants - the differences
     between an IN-VALID and a DAN are subtle at best.  Some shorter,
     some wearing glasses, some with receding hairlines or bald, many
     with no discernable physical difference at all.  The
     Investigator is only halfway down the line before he turns and
     starts walking back to his car.

     The mystified Detective Hugo follows his superior.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              This is the most likely location--

     The Investigator wheels on Hugo, suddenly angry, clearly unused
     to having his judgement questioned.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              --There's that word again.  I have a feeling
              This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not
              exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely"
              that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for
              fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come
              to us now like a lamb?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (taken aback by the outburst)
              Is there something more we should know about this
              suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid
              have shown up at the scene of four serious
              felonies.  Do you need any more than that?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent
              citizens have left specimens at as many crime
              scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              I don't like anybody this unlucky.
                      (pause)
              Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile
              radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier
              establishments.  Random car stops.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              We're already getting complaints about
              frivolous search.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              This is a murder investigation.  The public
              should be happy to co-operate, to get this
              disease off the streets.


     INT.  CONCERT HALL.  NIGHT.

     A standing ovation.  The YOUNG PIANIST on the stage bows deeply,
     soaking up the applause of the AUDIENCE.  The pianist tosses one
     of his white gloves into the front row where it is caught by an
     adoring FAN.  The second glove he tosses up to the box where
     JEROME and IRENE are standing.  Jerome snares the glove out of
     the air and immediately hands it to Irene.  She promptly slips
     the glove on her own hand.

     The glove fits snugly over her five fingers.  However one finger
     of the glove remains unfilled.  Jerome is stunned to realize
     that it is a six-fingered glove.

                           IRENE
                      (catching his look of astonishment)
              You didn't know?

                           JEROME
                      (trying hard to convince)
              Yes...yes...

                           IRENE
                      (picking up a resentment, confused)
              You're angry--

                           JEROME
              Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.

     He quickly turns away to lead the applause.  On stage, the
     pianist raises his hands to acknowledge the crowd.  Both his
     hands contain a perfectly formed extra finger.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - PROSTITUTE'S BOUDOIR.  NIGHT.

     From an upstairs window we observe the INVESTIGATOR's car
     cruise slowly back into the squalid housing project.  A MAN is
     buckling his pants at the window.

                           JOHN
              Shit!  One of those Hoovers is back.

     A prostitute, VALERIE, a slender, sylphlike beauty, joins him at
     the window.

                           VALERIE
              It's alright.  He's here to see me.

     Her client looks at her askance.  Despite her assurances, he
     hurries into his clothes anyway.

                           VALERIE
                      (to an unseen woman in the next room)
              Sonja, I can't see anyone else tonight.


     INT.  IN-VALID HOUSING PROJECT - PROSTITUTE'S BOUDOIR.  NIGHT.

     The INVESTIGATOR, sits up in the bed, glass in his hand.
     VALERIE lies on the tangled sheets, naked, making no effort to
     cover herself.  She regards the Investigator curiously.

                           VALERIE
              I don't understand you, Investigator.

     The Investigator glances idly in her direction.

                           VALERIE
                      (teasing good-naturedly)
              You hunt us by day and fuck us by night.  Do
              you only get it up for In-valids?

     The Investigator smiles and rejoins her on the bed.

                           VALERIE
              Wouldn't you be happier with one of your
              made-to-order whores?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (gently stroking her hair)
              You are so beautiful, are you sure you weren't
              altered?  This is not the face, the body, of
              a Godchild.  How could something so lovely
              be a product of chance?

                           VALERIE
              Is that what keeps you coming back?
                      (meeting his gaze)
              Look at you.  Such angry, beautiful, perfect eyes.
              Do you ever wonder what they would see if they
              weren't quite so perfect?  They will never see
              what I see.

     The Investigator tries to laugh off her assertion but his
     tight-lipped smile betrays his displeasure.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (a cruel edge to his voice)
              You have so much wrong with you, you'll
              be lucky to see next year.

     He roughly forces himself on top of her but she remains defiant.

                           VALERIE
              Are you so much more alive, Investigator?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (parting her legs)
              I'm not paying you to talk.


     INT/EXT.  IRENE'S CAR.  NIGHT.

     IRENE drives, JEROME at her side.  Cars are being flagged down
     by uniformed POLICE OFFICERS.  Irene slows down behind the car
     in front.  Spying an OFFICER shine a flashlight in the eyes of
     the MALE DRIVER up ahead, Jerome wipes the contact lenses from
     his eyes and flicks them out of the passenger window when Irene
     is not looking.

     An OFFICER approaches Jerome and, without a word, opens an
     electronic testing kit worn on his hip.  He removes a sterilized
     Q-tip and motions for Jerome to open his mouth so he can scrape
     a culture.  Jerome waves his hand in front of his mouth,
     feigning embarrassment.

                           JEROME
                      (conspiratorial)
              Better not.
                      (nodding in Irene's direction)
              Don't want to give you a contaminated
              specimen...if you get my meaning.

     IRENE plays along, shrugging coyly at the cop.

     We see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of Jerome's hand as he furtively
     retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff.  With the
     hair already in his fingers, he pretends to pluck a hair from
     his head, faking a wince at the appropriate moment.

     The cop, wearing transparent latex gloves, takes the follicle
     and places it in a receptacle in his kit.  After a short moment
     the hair confirms JEROME's driving ID which appears on the kit's
     electronic screen.  As the cop departs, Irene looks
     questioningly at Jerome.

                           JEROME
              Thanks.
                      (answering her unasked question)
              You never know where those swabs have been.

     Irene nods, however clearly not convinced.  She shakes the doubt
     from her mind.

                           IRENE
              I want to show you something.

     She accelerates away.  We see the road ahead from Jerome's POV.
     Without his contact lenses, it is a blur.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB.  NIGHT.

     After closing time, suited DETECTIVES vacuum the club in which
     Jerome and Eugene dined the previous evening.  MICHAEL, the
     owner, looks on disdainfully.  Waiting in the background, the
     regular CLEANERS - most likely In-valids themselves - smirk to
     each other, enjoying watching the cops do their work for them.


     EXT.  OCEAN HIGHWAY.  NIGHT.

     With no place to turn the car around, IRENE parks on the cliff
     side of the six-lane highway.  In the darkness she dashes from
     the car and, without a second thought, runs directly out into
     the heavy commuter traffic.  Easily negotiating the on-coming
     cars, she emerges safely on the other side of the highway.

     JEROME, rounding the car from the passenger side, is about to
     follow, when he suddenly pulls up sharply at the curb.  We focus
     on his eyes, deprived of the benefit of their contact lenses.
     From Jerome's POV, we see that the headlights rushing towards
     him are nothing but a series of fast-moving blurs - blurs that
     merge together.  He is unable to distinguish between the
     vehicles or judge their distance.

                           IRENE
                      (calling back urgently from the
                      other side, mindful of the light
                      beginning to leak into the sky)
              Come on!  We'll miss it!

     Irene stares expectantly back at Jerome with her 20/20 vision,
     unaware of his predicament.  Jerome puts a foot off the curb at
     the wrong moment and is almost collected by an on-coming car.
     Irene is taken-aback at his mistiming.  Does she detect a squint
     on Jerome's face?  To Jerome, the figure of Irene on the other
     side of the highway is merely a featureless shape but he feels
     her expectation.  He touches the spectacles, still in his
     pocket, but they are an unthinkable option.

     He shakes the idea from his head and turns back to the swiftly-
     flowing highway.  He makes up his mind - he cannot allow himself
     to be shamed, even at the risk of life and limb.  Hardly even
     glancing at the traffic, he suddenly bolts blindly across the
     road.  Headlights hurtling towards him, cars fortuitously
     brushing past his heels, horns blaring.  Jerome makes a final
     leap to the haven of the far curb, the rush of air from a large,
     fast-moving truck blowing him the final inches to the sidewalk.

     Irene is stunned by the near miss.  She is about to comment but
     Jerome takes her by the arm and ushers her towards the dunes.

                           JEROME
              Come on.  We'll miss it.


     EXT.  BEACH.  DAWN.

     JEROME and IRENE huddle beneath an overcoat as the sun crests
     the horizon, staining the sky with an ochre blush.

                           IRENE
              What did I tell you?

     Jerome nods.  However, to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing
     but an out-of-focus, abstract ink blot.

                           IRENE
              I envy you, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              You'll be next.

                           IRENE
              I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make
              in space is around the sun--
                      (letting a handful of sand
                      slip through her fingers)
              --on this satellite right here.

     Irene turns to Jerome.

                           IRENE
                      (blurting out what's really on her mind)
              --Listen, I don't want to waste your time
              and I really don't want you to waste mine.
              I don't know what you're after but I have
              a feeling I'm not it.

     Irene suddenly takes Jerome's hand and puts it up her
     sweater, onto her breast.  Although taken aback, Jerome makes
     no effort to withdraw his hand.

                           IRENE
                      (enjoying his unease)
              It's here.  My heart.
                      (adding quickly)
              I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a
              drug maintenance program, blood thinners,
              diet--
                      (slowly removing his hand)
              I just want you to know what you'd be getting
              yourself into.

                           JEROME
              What exactly is wrong?

                           IRENE
              Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing
              symptoms in my late-fifties.
                      (matter-of-fact)
              But unless they come up with something between
              now and then, I won't live much past 67.

     Jerome's mouth drops a little, betraying his surprise at the
     statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties.

                           IRENE
              Of course I think about it every day.

                           JEROME
                      (still not quite recovered from his surprise)
              Of course.


     INT.  POOL.  MORNING.

     The INVESTIGATOR swims his race with the unseen opponent.  The
     Investigator's ASSISTANT, carrying a phone, tries to attract his
     attention.


     EXT.  JEROME'S POOL.  MORNING.

     JEROME sits at his own poolside in his robe, feet dangling over
     the edge, smoking a cigarette.  EUGENE, from his wheelchair, is
     applying bleach to Jerome's hair and eyebrows with gloved
     hands.

     At the same time, Jerome plays a sleight-of-hand game with a
     syringe.

                           EUGENE
              How was your evening?

                           JEROME
              Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.

                           EUGENE
                      (teasing)
              You are a catch.  No doubt she's worried that
              she would lower the standard of your offspring.
              Everybody wants to "breed up".
                      (idly curious)
              What's wrong with her?

                           JEROME
                      (trying to be blasÈ)
              You know how it is with these altered births
              --somebody told her she's not going to live
              forever and she's been preparing to die ever
              since.

                           EUGENE
              You're not thinking of telling her, are you?

                           JEROME
              Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.

                           EUGENE
                      (adamant)
              She doesn't have to know.  She doesn't want to know.

     The camera travels down Jerome's scarred legs to find that the
     pool is completely drained.  We now realize that it never
     contained water.


     A BARREN WASTELAND.

     A desolate landscape, resembling the surface of the planet Mars.
     We pull back to find that we are peering at this forbidding
     desert through a circular aperture.


     INT.  CRIME LAB.  DAY.

     The INVESTIGATOR lifts his head from the eyepiece of an
     electron microscope through which he has been examining a tiny
     fragment of skin - the skin is identified as belonging to 20-
     YEAR-OLD VINCENT.  DETECTIVE HUGO stands at the Investigator's
     side - his attitude more respectful in light of the discovery.

     Detective Hugo points out a location on a computer-generated
     map.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (chagrined)
              The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant.
              The employees are all accounted for.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (shifting the view of the map
                      to include the Gattaca complex)
              No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have
              shown up there in the past.

     The Investigator understands the significance.  They wander over
     to a blow-up photograph of the 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              We have to consider the possibility that he's
              playing somebody else's hand.

     A smile gradually broadens across the Investigator's face.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (taking a perverse pleasure in the
                      slowly dawning revelation)
              Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".
                      (glancing to a photo of the
                      Gattaca crime scene)
              He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find
              the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to
              take a leak during a murder.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (quickly covering himself)
              It's still possible the eyelash specimen came
              from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown
              in through an open window.

     The Investigator appears not to be listening, his mind made up.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (mind racing)
              He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (puzzled)
              It is hard to believe he could be one of
              their elite workers.  You've seen their
              security system.  They know who works there.
                      (referring to 20-year-old Vincent's profile)
              Even if you ignore the man's expiration date,
              his profile suggests that he doesn't have the
              mathematical propensity let alone the stamina
              to pass their physicals.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Don't underestimate these imposters.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (skeptical, referring to a file of
                      Gattaca employee ID photos)
              None of the ID photos match the enhancement.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (smiling to himself)
              A man can change his face--but blood is forever.
              Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.
                      (pause)
              Intravenous.

     Hugo's mouth drops open at the mention of "intravenous".

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (immediately protesting)
              You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at
              least fall into the category.  We'll be
              closing down their operation for days.
                      (seeking a compromise)
              At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shaking his head)
              Blood.  From the vein.

     The Investigator turns on his heel to prevent further protest.
     The Detective and his ASSISTANTS exchange looks of exasperation
     behind the Investigator's back.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME, drinking water, stands in front of a large video
     bulletin board.  Among other things, it displays the electronic
     mugshot of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT alongside the recent computer
     generated age enhancement of his face.

     Some distance away, CAESAR, the elderly janitor, discusses the
     mugshots with a YOUNGER JANITOR.

                           CAESAR
              Look like anybody to you?

                           YOUNGER JANITOR
              Not to me.

                           CAESAR
              Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he?

     Jerome half-smiles, realizing that the conversation is for his
     benefit.  Having made it clear that they do not intend to expose
     their former colleague, the two janitors continue their rounds.

     Jerome crushes his paper cup.  Forgetting himself, he
     drops the cup into the wastebasket.


     INT.  CRAFT.  DAY.

     JEROME familiarizes himself with the interior of a spacecraft
     under the supervision of DIRECTOR JOSEF and the MISSION
     COMMANDER.  The screen that Jerome sits at is identical to the
     one he operates in the computer complex - displaying asteroid
     951 Gaspra.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              --Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key.
                      (warming to his theme)
              Back to the beginning of the book--the life we
              became.  With the original building blocks who
              knows how far we can take "the godding".

                           MISSION COMMANDER
                      (wry smile)
              Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be
              last year's model by the time we're done.

                           JEROME
                      (smiling back)
              I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander.

     Irene enters the craft.

                           IRENE
              Excuse me, Mr Morrow.  The investigators have
              begun their testing.

                           DETECTIVE JOSEF
              This is so inconvenient, Irene.  They can
              make an exception for Jerome.

                           IRENE
              I'm afraid not.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              I apologize, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              It's not yor fault, Director.
                      (afterthought)
              If your predecessor were still around
              we may not be going to Gaspra at all.
              That's what I would call inconvenient.

     Jerome exits the craft with Irene.


     INT.  GATTACA CORPORATION - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

     A line of MALE GATTACA EMPLOYEES snakes out the door and down
     the corridor.  The INVESTIGATOR walks slowly down the line,
     trying to eyeball his suspect.  Concentrating on the shorter,
     dark-haired men in the line, he looks straight past JEROME.
     However, as the Investigator ignores him and walks by, we see a
     haunted look in Jerome's eyes.


     INT.  GATTACA - TESTING LAB.  DAY.

     Every available TECHNICIAN is working to accommodate the testing
     of the thousand or so PROGRAMMERS.  Twelve testing stations
     operate simultaneously.  A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE supervises each
     station.  JEROME reaches the head of the line.  He notes an
     exiting COLLEAGUE holding a cotton ball to his arm.

     A NURSE directs Jerome to LAMAR's testing station.  Lamar
     deposits the previous patient's labeled vial into a blood
     carousel under the watchful eye of a large DETECTIVE, clearly
     not relishing his assignment.  Jerome rolls up his sleeve.

                           JEROME
                      (referring to the table lined with syringes)
              What's with the plungers, Lamar?  What are
              you doing, opening a blood bank?

     The syringes are clearly not Lamar's idea.

                           LAMAR
                      (sarcastic)
              The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that
              my testing methods may have been compromised.

     Lamar inserts a fresh syringe into Jerome's arm.  As Lamar draws
     the blood, Jerome suddenly flinches and flexes his arm
     violently, causing the needle to bend and buckle, exiting the
     skin from a second puncture point.

                           JEROME
              Damn!!

     Having pulled away from Lamar's grasp, Jerome withdraws the bent
     needle himself, blood still squirting from his vein.

                           LAMAR
                      (grabbing a nearby wad of gauze)
              Jesus--I'm sorry, Jerome.

     The large Homicide Detective winces and turns away from the red
     arcing spray, a splash of blood spattering his shoes.  In the
     midst of the commotion, with his practised sleight-of-hand,
     Jerome removes the vial from the syringe and replaces it with
     another concealed vial.

                           JEROME
                      (unfazed, putting Lamar at his ease)
              You must be out of practise, Lamar.

     Lamar hurriedly takes the syringe from Jerome.

                           LAMAR
                      (examining and removing the
                      switched vial from the bent syringe)
              I've got enough here.

                           JEROME
                      (regarding the squimish detective,
                      as he holds the gauze to his arm)
              Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.

     The Detective notices the spatter of blood across his brogues
     and, with a look of disdain, wipes it clean.  He tosses the
     incriminating tissue down a hygenically sealed garbage shoot.

     Lamar places Jerome's labelled vial in the carousel where it is
     immediately analyzed by the computer.  Jerome's "legitimate"
     Employee ID code appears on the screen - "VALID".  Another
     EMPLOYEE enters the testing lab.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME exits the testing lab with the gauze held to his arm.
     IRENE is standing outside the door.

                           IRENE
              So you didn't do it after all.

                           JEROME
                      (joking darkly)
              I guess somebody beat me to it.


     INT.  GATTACA - MEZZANINE FLOOR.  LATER IN THE DAY.

     From above, the INVESTIGATOR and HUGO observe the final EMPLOYEE
     exit the testing lab.

     LAMAR, following the employee out of the lab, throws a look of
     vindication to the two cops.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              That's the last.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Something's not right.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (losing his patience)
              He's not here.  It's a blind alley.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (resolute)
              No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              We don't have the manpower.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Get it.  From outside, if you have to.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              From what budget?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (angered by Hugo's excuses)
              I'll take it out of your damn pension if
              you question my authority one more time!

     The INVESTIGATOR turns his back on his subordinate and idly
     contemplates the nearby telescope.  Hugo resignedly relays the
     news to Director Josef who is standing some distance away.
     Josef's immediate reaction is to march towards the Investigator,
     Hugo trailing behind.  DIRECTOR JOSEF collects himself as he
     notices the Investigator's hand on the telescope.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              Would you care to look--in the telescope?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Thank you, no.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (still referring to the telescope)
              One look through there and you would know why
              I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations
              any further.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (unfazed)
              You're so unconcerned that you have a killer
              in your midst.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              Right now, your presence is creating more of
              a threat.  I don't think you have any concept
              of what we do here--how meticulous our
              preparations must be.  We are about to send
              twelve people through 140 million miles of
              blackness to rendezvous with an object the size
              of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather
              critical to point them in the right direction.
              And we certainly don't need you looking over our
              shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is
              any evidence that the killer is amongst us.  I
              don't see too many other dead bodies littering
              the place.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (surveying the mostly empty facility)
              No, but since there aren't too many live ones
              tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one
              further sweep.  If he does not work here, then
              there should be no other trace of him.
                      (to Hugo)
              I think you'd better get some people out of bed,
              Detective.
                      (a thought occurs)
              In the meantime we can re-check his favorite
              haunt.

     Director Josef quietly seethes.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to Josef, referring to the telescope)
              You see, Director, I prefer my microscope.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     JEROME readies himself for an evening out - a bandage around his
     arm from the needle puncture.  EUGENE wheels himself in.

                           EUGENE
              Where are we going?

                           JEROME
                      (slightly guilty)
              I'm sorry.  I've got plans.

                           EUGENE
                      (feigning hurt)
              Again?

                           JEROME
                      (referring to his bandage)
              She's already got her doubts.  I have to act
              like nothing's wrong.

                           EUGENE
              I'm sure you'll be very convincing.

     Jerome ignores the remark.

                           EUGENE
              Where are you taking her?

                           JEROME
              Michael's.

     Eugene looks at him askance.

                           JEROME
              Everybody goes there.

                           EUGENE
                      (incredulous, glancing around the room)
              You may as well invite her here.

                           JEROME
                      (afterthought as he picks up his jacket)
              Will you be okay?

                           EUGENE
              Don't worry about your little pin cushion.
              To be honest, I'm looking forward to having
              the place to myself.

                           JEROME
                      (seeing through the bravado)
              We'll still be able to talk when I'm away.
              The conversation will just keep getting longer.

                           EUGENE
              How long?

                           JEROME
              By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and
              say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes
              later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"

                           EUGENE
              I guess I'd better have something important
              to say if it takes that long to get an answer.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB.  NIGHT.

     IRENE and JEROME step off the dance floor of the smoky, decadent
     dinner club and take a seat at their table.  Irene is agog at
     the strange assortment of PATRONS, the cigars, the laden dessert
     trolleys.  It is all slightly off from the pristine world she is
     accustomed to.

                           IRENE
              What is this place?

                           JEROME
                      (wry smile, enjoying her fascination)
              You've never been here?
                      (a dessert trolley is wheeled up)
              Let me order for you.

     Jerome selects a chocolate torte from the trolley.  Jerome
     savors a spoonful.  Irene is tempted but then remembers herself.

                           IRENE
              I'd better not.

     She reaches for her elegant pill box.  Jerome takes another
     spoonful.

                           JEROME
              So sure of what you can't do.  Do you even
              know what it tastes like, Irene?

     Irene goes to deny it but cannot.

     MICHAEL suddenly approaches the table with a WAITER in tow.
     Irene is about to steal a taste of the dessert with her finger
     when their plates and glasses are whisked away and the table
     immediately hoovered.  Michael whispers in Jerome's ear.

                           MICHAEL
              Take the side door.

     Jerome looks up in time to see DETECTIVE HUGO coming through the
     front entrance with several other DETECTIVES.

                           DETECTIVE
                      (to his colleagues)
              Check for lenses, hairpieces--

     A Detective shines a flashlight in the eyes of a MALE PATRON.
     A SECOND DETECTIVE tugs the hair of a SECOND PATRON.  Jerome
     takes Irene by the hand and escorts her out of the side exit.
     Several other COUPLES make for the parking lot.

                           IRENE
              Why are we leaving?

                           JEROME
                      (attempting to explain the hasty exit)
              Those checks take forever.


     EXT.  MICHAEL'S CLUB - SIDE ALLEY.  NIGHT.

     Spilling out of the exit, JEROME and IRENE find a burly
     plain clothes DETECTIVE barring their way.  Before the Detective
     can say a word, Jerome has wrapped his fist in his jacket sleeve
     and smashed him in the face.  He continues to beat the Detective
     until he lies motionless on the ground.

                           IRENE
                      (stunned)
              Jerome!

     Spying other Detectives some distance away in the parking lot.
     Jerome leads Irene out of a hidden side gate.

                           IRENE
              What about the car?

                           JEROME
                      (grabbing her by the hand)
              Let's walk.

                           IRENE
              Who are they?

                           JEROME
                      (holding his bruised knuckles)
              It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.

     Jerome drags Irene across a vast, desolate lot, lit only by
     moonlight.  Feeling exposed, he breaks into a run.

                           IRENE
              I can't.

                           JEROME
                      (anxious)
              Come on.

                           IRENE
              My medication.  I left it back there.

                           JEROME
              We'll get it later.
                      (forcing her to look him in the eye)
              Irene, please.

     Irene realizes his seriousness.  She begins to run with him.
     The clearing is wider than Jerome anticipated.  They are only
     halfway across - extremely vulnerable if the Detective think yo
     look in their direction.


     INT.  MICHAEL'S.  NIGHT.

     The INVESTIGATOR is grilling MICHAEL, the club's owner.  The
     investigator suspiciously regards the multitude of mini-vacs in
     the kitchen and the incinerator burning the refuse.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (an accusing tone)
              You run a clean establishment.

                           MICHAEL
              Are you a health inspector?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (showing Vincent's mugshot)
              Do you recognize this man?

                           MICHAEL
              My eyes aren't so good.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              I bet.

     Hugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered
     his fallen colleague.

                           HUGO
              Sir.

     The Investigator hurries to him.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to the still dazed Detective,
                      examining his injuries)
              Did he hit you with his fist?

                           DETECTIVE
                      (head in his hands)
              More like a hammer.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (reprimanding the beaten Detective)
              Don't touch your face.  Don't swallow.
              Don't spit.
                      (to Hugo)
              Quick, clean his teeth.

     Hugo uses a flashlight and a small dental-like implement to try
     to pick skin from Jerome's knuckles from between the Detective's
     teeth.  The Investigator finds the hidden side door.


     EXT.  DESOLATE LOT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and IRENE continue to sprint across the enormous vacant
     lot in the moonlight, splashing through deposits of mud and
     water.  Just as the gate opens in the distance, Jerome hurls
     Irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side.
     Irene, out of breath, desperately feels for her pulse.

                           IRENE
                      (upset, a strangled protest)
              Are you trying to kill me?  Are you?!
              Don't you understand, I can't do that!

     Jerome tenderly removes Irene's hand from her pulse.

                           JEROME
              You just did.

     Irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just
     negotiated, realizing what she has just done.

     From across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing
     cry from the center FIGURE.

                           INVESTIGATOR (OC)
              Vincent!  Vincent!


     EXT.  MICHAEL'S.  NIGHT.

     The INVESTIGATOR is about to cry out Vincent's name once again
     when he realizes DETECTIVE HUGO and the other DETECTIVES are
     watching him, askance.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to Hugo, covering his frustration)
              What are you waiting for?

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Where do we start?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.

                           DETECTIVE
                      (handing the Investigator Irene's pill box)
              We caught them trying to flush these, Sir.

     The Investigator carefully examines the heart pills.


     EXT.  IRENE'S APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

     JEROME walks IRENE to the steps of her apartment.  Jerome thinks
     about departing but Irene takes him gently by the hand.

                           IRENE
              So sure of what you can't do.

     Jerome follows her inside.


     INT.  IRENE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and IRENE climb a staircase to her bedroom.  Without
     another word they begin to make love.

     LATER THAT NIGHT, JEROME cannot sleep.  He rises quietly so as
     not to disturb IRENE.  He silently opens the double-windows of
     the upstairs bedroom.  He carefully gathers his pillow from the
     bed and shakes it out of the window.

     Slowly Jerome turns to gaze at the wood floor.  In the moonlight
     we see an EXTREME CLOSE UP of a single hair lying on the
     floorboards.  Jerome bends and picks up the hair, trying to
     identify it in the dim light.  On his hands and knees he tries
     to clean the floor with a towel.  Irene turns over in the
     bed.  Jerome freezes but she continues to sleep.  He realizes he
     may be spreading even more of his skin and hair over the floor.
     Overcome with frustration and the enormity of his task, he
     begins to quietly weep.


     EXT.  A FIELD.  DAWN.

     A light shroud of mist hangs over the trees that encircle a
     grassy clearing beyond Irene's building.  Something lies in the
     center of the clearing.

     We jump-cut to an EXTREME CLOSE UP of two or three blades of
     grass.  Bristles rain down on the blades.  Withotu access to his
     incinerator, the crouched, naked figure of JEROME disposes of
     his whiskers, skin and hair in an open field.  His clothes sit
     in a neat pile at his side.  He pours glycolic acid over his
     body and scrubs at his back, feet and hands with a brush.  There
     is a haunted, tortured look in his eyes as he tries desperately
     to rid himself of himself.


     INT.  POOL.  MORNING.

     The INVESTIGATOR swims obsessively in his aquatic treadmill.


     INT.  IRENE'S APARTMENT.  LATER THAT MORNING.

     Back in the bedroom, JEROME, partially dressed, holds IRENE
     in bed.  She softly touches the scars on his shins.

                           IRENE
                      (referring to the shins)
              What happened?

                           JEROME
              You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?
              It's the exact height of the front fender.
                      (shrugs)
              Looked right instead of left.

                           IRENE
                      (comforted by the thought)
              So you're not so smart after all.
                      (awkward about raising the subject)
              I want you to know--if it ever came to it--
              I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg
              Bank.  In fact, I'd rather use a donor egg--
                      (quickly covering herself again)
              --if it came to it.

                           JEROME
              But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--
                      (searching for an appropriate body part)
              --nose.
                      (stroking her face)
              How perfect does your child have to be?

                           IRENE
                      (mildly irritated by what she
                      perceives as his mocking)
              You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment
              you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't
              for who you are--what you are?  Don't you get
              any satisfaction knowing that your children
              will be able to live to a ripe old age unless
              they do something foolish?

                           JEROME
              That's precisely what scaresme--that they
              won't do anything foolish or courageous or
              anything--worth a Goddamn.

     Irene is taken aback by Jerome's passion, regarding him in a new
     light.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  MORNING.

     EUGENE urinates into a large plastic container while drinking
     bottled water at the same time.  He already has several other
     containers of urine on the table beside him.


     INT.  GATTACA.  MORNING.

     The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO keep a wary eye on the
     outfitted DETECTIVES re-vacuuming the empty computer complex
     with their mini-vacs.

                           HUGO
                      (reading newspaper)
              My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (shrugs, ambivalent)
              Why not?

                           HUGO
              These new personality corrections I've been
              reading about.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              You worried about the cost?

                           HUGO
              Not that.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (regarding Hugo with a condescending smile)
              They said the same thing about myopia and
              obesity.  You think your children would be
              less human if they were less violent, angry,
              spiteful?  Maybe they'd be more human.  From
              where I sit the world could stand a little
              improving.

     We dwell on one DETECTIVE in particular, snatching a garbage
     bag from CAESAR, the janitor.

                           DETECTIVE
              Don't touch that.  It's evidence.

     He puts a pile of discarded paper cups aside for later testing.


     INT.  GATTACA CORPORATION.  LATER THAT MORNING.

     In the vast, empty Gattaca complex the INVESTIGATOR inspects a
     specimen bag containing Jerome's paper cup with DIRECTOR JOSEF
     and DETECTIVE HUGO.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              Positive saliva match.  The cup was
              definitely used since the original sweep.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              So we have two choices.  Either our suspect
              came back to the murder scene for a drink of
              water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...
                      (looking out over the empty complex)
              ...he is here.
                      (resolute)
              We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a
              desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that
              night--perhaps their place in line.
                      (to Director Josef)
              I'd like the profiles of everyone with an
              upcoming mission.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (nervous)
              Twelve have a mission within the week.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              This time I will supervise each test personally.


     INT/EXT.  GATTACA.  MORNING.

     JEROME and IRENE walk towards the entrance to Gattaca.  Spying
     the Homicide Investigation trucks parked at the rear of the
     building and the silhouette of the INVESTIGATOR in the doorway,
     Jerome pulls up sharply.  Irene notices his unease.

                           IRENE
              What is it?

                           JEROME
              I forgot something--something at home.
              I'll see you later.

     Jerome kisses her.  Irene, also aware of the trucks,
     interrogates Jerome with her eyes.

                           IRENE
              I'll miss you.

     Jerome is still focussed on the entranceway.

                           IRENE
                      (looking skywards)
              --when you go away.

                           JEROME
              We could go together one day.

     Irene considers the idea.  She enters Gattaca alone.


     INT.  GATTACA AEROSPACE CORPORATION - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  DAY.

     IRENE prepares a stack of ID photos of CREW MEMBERS for the
     INVESTIGATOR.  She closely inspects the doctored photo of
     JEROME, hesitating before adding it to the file.

     The camera dwells on JEROME's vacant work station.  The
     INVESTIGATOR curiously regards the empty chair.  He is
     accompanied by DETECTIVE HUGO, DIRECTOR JOSEF and IRENE.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              He's the only absentee.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
              A little nausea.  Quite common.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              At least it's nothing contagious.

                           DIRECTOR JOSEF
                      (unduly agitated)
              I will not permit any further testing on the
              eve of a mission.  We're already counting
              backwards.

     The INVESTIGATOR ignores Josef and takes a pocket knife from his
     jacket.  He prises out the "ESC" key from Jerome's keyboard,
     places the key in a specimen bag and deposits it in his jacket.

                           IRENE
                      (picking up a phone)
              I'll call and let him know.

     The Investigator gently but firmly removes the phone from
     Irene's hand and replaces the receiver in the cradle.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Let's not spoil the surprise.
                      (to Irene)
              I understand you can show us the way.

     The anxious Director Josef calls out to protest one further
     time but the Investigator is on his way out of the door.


     EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE GATTACA.  DAY.

     Outside the entrance to Gattaca, trying to hail a taxi, JEROME
     is startled to see a car carrying the INVESTIGATOR, DETECTIVE
     HUGO and IRENE roar out of the driveway.  JEROME calls on his
     portable wristphone.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     EUGENE, at his window, filling sachets as usual, hesitates
     before answering the phone.

                           EUGENE
              Hello?

                           JEROME (OC)
              How would you like to be yourself for the day?

                           EUGENE
                      (nonchalant)
              I was never very good at it, remember?


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM / HALLWAY.  DAY.

     With a look of resolve, EUGENE hangs up the phone.

     He wheels his chair up to the sweeping staircase and regards the
     first of many dozen steps.  The daunting staircase spirals away
     above him.


     INT.  INVESTIGATOR'S CAR.  DAY.

     HUGO drives.  The INVESTIGATOR looks to IRENE in the rear seat.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (taunting)
              You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?

     He hands her the pill box found in Michael's.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              You think you have problems?


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDO/JEROME'S CONDO.  DAY.

     Having wheeled his chair out of sight, EUGENE eases himself out
     of his wheelchair and onto the floor.  Using his elbows,
     commando-style, dragging his lifeless legs behind him, he
     proceeds to crawl across the floor and up the first step of the
     long spiral staircase.  We observe his agonizingly slow progress
     up a staircase that, from Eugene's point of view, appears to
     have doubled in length.


     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  DAY.

     The INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO emerge from their car with
     IRENE in tow.  They take in the impressive complex - the
     Investigator gets a glimpse of the empty pool.  They approach
     the intercom at the entrance.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     EUGENE, bathed in sweat, finally crests the landing of the
     staircase.  No respite.  As he drags himself across the floor
     the internal phone rings.  He frantically stretches up and
     knocks the phone off its hook so he can talk from his prone
     position on the floor.


     INT.  CONDOMINIUM - LOBBY.  DAY.

     IRENE is on the phone, closely watched by the INVESTIGATOR and
     DETECTIVE HUGO.

                           EUGENE (OC)
                      (through intercom, no trace of his distress)
              Hello.

                           IRENE
                      (a moment's hesitation)
              Jerome--?

                           EUGENE
              Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     With no mean effort, EUGENE finally manages to replace the phone
     on its cradle.  He desperately crawls up onto the sofa.
     However, spying the upright vacuum cleaner in the open closet,
     he is forced to crawl there and remove the vacuum bag.  He
     frantically crawls back towards the sofa and stuffs the bag
     behind a cushion.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     IRENE enters the door deliberately left ajar, closely followed
     by the INVESTIGATOR and DETECTIVE HUGO.  EUGENE is propped up on
     the sofa, TV remote control placed in his useless hand to cover
     his paralysis.  He has a stainless steel bowl next to him and
     has crossed his lifeless legs for a more natural effect.  Eugene
     calmy motions the confused Irene towards him.

                           EUGENE
              Where's my kiss?

     The Investigator scrutinizes Irene's reaction.  With only the
     merest hesitation she takes her cue from Eugene and kisses
     him affectionately on the forehead.  She perches herself on the
     arm of the sofa.  Eugene takes the opportunity to rest his
     arm on her leg.

                           IRENE
              Good to see you're feeling better.

                           EUGENE
              Now you're here.  Who are your "friends"?

                           IRENE
              It's about the Director.

                           EUGENE
                      (feigning boredom)
              Again?

     The Investigator slowly circles Eugene, regarding him with the
     utmost scrutiny.  He compares his face to the doctored Gattaca
     ID photo - a passable likeness.  Eugene bends towards the bowl
     and dry retches.

                           EUGENE
              Forgive me for not getting up.

     Irene puts a comforting hand on Eugene's shoulder.

                           IRENE
                      (to the Investigator)
              Couldn't we do this another time?

                           INVESTIGATOR
              I don't believe so.

     Detective Hugo takes a seat in the chair beside the sofa and
     unpacks a syringe from the kit he carries.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              This won't take a moment.

     Detective Hugo swabs Eugene's inner arm.  All eyes are trained
     on the tip of the needle as it punctures the vein.

                           EUGENE
                      (reassuring to Irene, referring to
                      the blood flowing into the syringe)
              It's okay.  Maybe they can find out what I've got.

     Under the Investigator's watchful eye, Detective Hugo withdraws
     the syringe and immediately inserts a small amount of the blood
     into the portable analyzer he wears.  Naturally, it confirms
     that Eugene is Jerome.

     Irene does her best to conceal her shock.  Hiding his
     frustration, the Investigator distractedly tours the room while
     Hugo packs up his gear.  The Investigator idly toys with
     the telescope pointed out of the window.

     Next he wanders towards the closet and reaches for the doorknob.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Mind if I take a leak?

                           EUGENE
              As long as you don't do it in my closet.
                      (nodding to the other side of the room)
              Over there.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM - BATHROOM.  DAY.

     The INVESTIGATOR immediately pulls a specimen bag from his
     jacket pocket and closely inspects the stainless steel toilet
     and sink.  They are both spotless.  The shower stall is also
     scrupulously clean.  He flushes the toilet and exits.

     Lost in thought, the INVESTIGATOR approaches the closet again
     and wheels out Jerome's upright vacuum cleaner.  He is
     disappointed a second time to find no vacuum bag inside.  The
     Investigator returns the vacuum cleaner to the closet and
     produces a mini-vac from Detective Hugo's crime bag.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (to Eugene, referring to ther mini-vac)
              May I?

                           EUGENE
              Clean the whole house if you want.

                           IRENE
                      (taking Eugene's lead)
              Actually, the kitchen needs doing.

     The Investigator switches on the mini-vac to take a specimen
     from the floor, then promptly kills the machine.  Looking down,
     the Investigator notices the trail of Eugene's perspiration
     on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase.

     Eugene, reading the Investigator's mind, goes to call out but
     the words remain frozen on his tongue.  Hugo follows his
     superior as they start to descend the stairs.  Irene and Eugene
     are left staring at one another.


     INT.  CONDO - STAIRCASE.  DAY.

     JEROME catches the merest glimpse of the INVESTIGATOR and
     DETECTIVE HUGO before he slips behind a doorway in Eugene's
     condominium.

     Jerome anxiously regards Eugene's empty wheelchair sitting
     there.  On the stairs, Hugo's phone rings.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO (OC)
                      (into phone, increasingly encouraged)
              Yes?...Yes...yes...

     The Investigator is already at the foot of the stairs in
     Eugene's condo when the Detective calls to him.

                           DETECTIVE
                      (urgent, to Investigator)
              Come quickly.  We have him.

     The Investigator's eyes light up.  He retraces his steps
     up the staircase after Detective Hugo.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.

     JEROME, white as a ghost, climbs the stairs, emerging into his
     own condominium.  He embraces the beaming EUGENE, still sitting
     on the sofa.

                           JEROME
                      (numb)
              How are you, Jerome?

                           EUGENE
              Not bad, Jerome.

                           JEROME
              How the hell did you get here.

                           EUGENE
                      (deadpan)
              I could always walk.  I've been faking it.

     Jerome almost laughs, despite the situation.  Only now does he
     notice Irene on the other side of the room, her mind racing.
     She looks at Jerome and Eugene together and runs from the
     apartment.

                           JEROME
                      (calling after her)
              Irene.

     Jerome goes to follow but Eugene stops him.


     INT.  CRIME LABORATORY.  DAY.

     An EXTREME CLOSE UP of dried blood - brittle and cracking - on
     a pair of soiled latex gloves.  A latex head mask, suit of
     clothes and shoe covers are similarly caked.  The INVESTIGATOR
     and DETECTIVE HUGO watch as a white-coated FORENSIC TECHNICIAN
     feeds a minute sample of the dried blood into an analyzer.

     The INVESTIGATOR wanders over to a one-way glass window through
     which he can observe DIRECTOR JOSEF, sitting numb but strangely
     serene in an interrogation room.  The Investigator, in a state
     of shock himself, cannot yet bring himself to believe what is
     plainly obvious.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (gazing at the Director, struggling
                      to come to grips with the turn of events)
              This can't be him.

     The Detective regards his superior incredulously, intrigued that
     he could still cling so stubbornly to his theory in the face of
     such overwhelming evidence.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (intrigued)
              We found his spit in the dead director's eye.
              He's signed a confession--supplied us with the
              suit he wore on the night.  What more do you
              want?

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (a trace of desperation, grasping at straws)
              Luca could still be an accomplice.

     The Investigator turns away, unwilling or unable to accept the
     explanation.  Hugo regards the Investigator with a trace of
     sympathy.  He furtively retrieves the Investigator's tissue
     from the trash.


     INT.  GATTACA.  DAY.

     JEROME sits in a formal briefing room with the other CREW
     MEMBERS of his mission, receiving their final pre-flight
     instructions.  LAMAR looks on approvingly.

                           MISSION COMMANDER
              --Finally, I'd like to welcome Navigator Morrow
              on his debut mission--if we get lost out there,
              nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like
              Jerome.

     Jerome looks up bashfully.

                           MISSION COMMANDER
                      (adopting a more serious tone)
              I'm gratified that there is no longer a cloud
              hanging over tomorrow's launch.  Now we can put
              this unpleasantness behind us and concentrate
              on the task at hand.  I don't have to tell you how
              important this mission is--the Belt could hold
              the key to the origin of life - why we are what
              we are.
                      (injecting a note of levity)
              I know many of you have been asking that
              question about me for long enough.
                      (referring to a projected photograph
                      of a misshapen asteroid behind his head)
              Gaspra--how could something so ugly hold so
              many beautiful secrets?

     Polite smiles from his colleagues.

                           MISSION COMMANDER
              Enjoy your final evening with your families.
              We'll all be a year older when they see
              us next.  And don't be late tomorrow.  You
              don't want to miss this.

     We focus on Jerome.  He appears to have his head in the heavens
     already.


     INT.  CRIME LAB.  NIGHT.

     The tormented INVESTIGATOR lies on the floor of his lab, staring
     at the ceiling.  he winces in discomfort.  He is lying on
     something.  He rolls over and retrieves the irritation from his
     pocket.  It is the "ESC" computer key he prized from Jerome's
     keyboard.

     He gazes at the key for a moment and then gets to his feet.  He
     resurrects an old fingerprint kit from a cupboard.  Carefully
     removing the key from the specimen bag - marked, "MORROW,
     Jerome" - he begins to dust it for a fingerprint.

     He places the key under a camera.  The enlarged print appears
     on the lefthand side of his computer screen.  The word "MATCH"
     blinks onto the screen.  However the face that appears from the
     computer's databank is not that of "MORROW, Jerome" but
     "LUCA, Vincent".  The Investigator regards the photograph in
     disbelief.

     DETECTIVE HUGO casually enters the lab, something odd in his
     nonchalant demeanor.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (excited)
              Hugo!  I've found him!

                           HUGO
              I've found him too.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (not listening, referring to his discovery)
              A fingerprint.  There's something to be
              said for nostalgia.
                      (realizing what Hugo has said)
              What did you find?

     Hugo puts a specimen bag on the counter.  It contains the
     Investigator's discarded tissue.  The Investigator does
     not recognize it.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
              It's not exactly him.

                           INVESTIGATOR
                      (interest piqued)
              Where did you get this?

     The Investigator immediately deposits the tissue into an
     analyzer.

                           DETECTIVE HUGO
                      (referring to the tissue)
              But this man does share some common
              characteristics with your suspect.  Not so
              many but enough.  It appears the eyelash
              has a brother--of a kind.

     The Investigator realizes the significance and looks guiltily
     to Hugo.  Hugo exits the lab, leaving the Investigator to stare
     at his own FACE in his analyzing machine.


     INT.  GATTACA - JANITOR'S LOCKER ROOM.  NIGHT.

     CAESAR, the old janitor, enters the locker room.  He is about to
     wearily open his locker when he senses another presence in the
     room.

     He turns to find JEROME sitting there on a bench.  Although
     clearly delighted, CAESAR tries to disguise his pleasure.

                           CAESAR
              So you've finally seen sense and come back
              to your old job, Vincent.

                           JEROME
              Not yet, I'm afraid.

                           CAESAR
              No?  What's keeping you?

                           JEROME
              I guess I'm a slow learner.

                           CAESAR
              I guess so.
                      (looking up through the
                      small window)
              Well, while you're up there, maybe you could
              tidy the place up a bit.

                           JEROME
              I'll see what I can do.

     The two men embrace, Caesar breaking off before Jerome.

                           CAESAR
              And don't go getting everybody lost out there.
              You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have
              me to keep an eye on you, you know.

                           JEROME
                      (glancing to Caesar's locker)
              By the way, I left some trash in your locker.

                           CAESAR
                      (happy to oblige)
              I'll take care of it.

     Jerome departs.  Caesar watches him go and turns back to his
     locker.  He opens it to find a brand new, high-tech telescope
     sitting inside.

     The old janitor gets over his surprise and beams broadly -
     he looks back in Jerome's direction but he has gone.  The
     old janitor cannot help himself and reverently reaches for the
     telescope's eyepiece.


     INT.  GATTACA - COMPUTER COMPLEX.  NIGHT.

     In the dimly-lit, empty computer complex, JEROME takes a last
     look around.  He sits at his computer, one final time replaying
     the graphic representation of his path through the cosmos that
     he is on the eve of taking for real.

     He notices the key missing from his keyboard.  Instantly
     realizing the significance, he rises from his seat to flee.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Vincent--

     Jerome is stopped in his tracks by the sound of his given name
     and the voice that calls it.

     He makes no further attempt to flee but turns to face his
     pursuer.  The Investigator steps out of the shadows.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Vincent, what are you running from?

                           JEROME
                      (disturbingly calm)
              From Vincent.

     The two men face each other for the first time in a long
     time.  The Investigator is transfixed by Jerome's face -
     scarcely able to believe his eyes.

                           INVESTIGATOR
              Has it been so long, you don't remember
              who I am?

                           JEROME
                      (nodding to the Investigator's badge)
              Maybe it's you who's forgotten.
                      (meeting his gaze)
              What are you doing here, Anton?

     It is finally apparent the Investigator is Jerome's younger
     brother Anton [AS WE SHALL REFER TO THE INVESTIGATOR FOR THE
     REST OF THE FILM].

                           ANTON
              I could ask you the same question.
                      (glancing to the impressive complex)
              I have a right to be here, you don't.

     Jerome smiles at him condescendingly.

                           JEROME
              You almost sound like you believe that.

                           ANTON
                      (ignoring the remark, extending his hand)
              Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far
              as you can go.

                           JEROME
                      (refusing Anton's hand, glancing
                      to the telescope above them)
              There are a few million miles to go yet.

                           ANTON
                      (adamant)
              It's over.

                           JEROME
                      (shaking his head)
              Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton,
              to see me fail?

                           ANTON
              It's for the best.

                           JEROME
                      (increasingly angered)
              God, even you want to tell me what I can't do.
              In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't
              need rescuing.  But you did, once.

     Anton is clearly stung by the memory.

                           JEROME
                      (goading)
              Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that
              possible?

                           ANTON
                      (resolute)
              You didn't beat me that day.  I beat myself.

                           JEROME
              Who are you trying to convince?

                           ANTON
                      (angry)
              I will prove it to you.  Come swim with
              me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.

     Jerome regards Anton with a knowing smile.  Somewhere in Gattaca
     a phone rings.


     INT/EXT.  IRENE'S CAR OUTSIDE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX.  NIGHT.

     IRENE, sitting in her car outside Jerome's condominium, hangs up
     her portable phone.  In her agitation, her finger involuntarily
     goes to her pulse.  She catches herself and removes the finger
     from her wrist as if it has burned her.  She exits the car.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM/EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     IRENE quietly knocks on Jerome's door but there is no response.
     Trying the handle, the door opens.  Her curiosity takes her
     inside.  All is quiet.  IRENE calls out.

                           IRENE
              Hello.

     No reply.  Irene hesitantly ventures further, drawn to the
     spiral staircase.  She tentatively makes her way down the stairs
     and into Eugene's dimly lit condominium.  With wonder and
     reverence, she examines the instruments and samples laid out on
     Eugene's work benches.  She opens the refrigerator in the
     bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets.  Finally she
     regards the empty incinerator.

                           EUGENE (OC)
              Quite something, isn't it?

     Irene turns.

     Eugene has entered through the mirrored door, not at all
     displeased by her unexpected visit.

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the incinerator)
              That's where we get rid of the traces of him
              although we never truly succeeded.

                           IRENE
              I've been looking for him.  Do you know where
              he is?

                           EUGENE
                      (unconcerned)
              He's probably leaving some more of me
              around the place before he goes.

     Eugene idly inspects one of the blood sachets.

                           EUGENE
              Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are
              just the clothes.  He has to wear them.
              Something I could never do.

                           IRENE
              What's wrong with him?

                           EUGENE
                      (sympathetic smile)
              You have more in common than you know.

     Irene's hand involuntarily goes to her heart.

                           EUGENE
              But they say hisis already ten thousand beats
              overdue.  I have my doubts.
                      (wry smile)
              For all my gifts, they could never engineer
              me a heart like Vincent's.

     Irene turns back to the incinerator, lost in though.


     EXT.  BEACH.  NIGHT.

     JEROME and ANTON walk down a dune together towards the beach not
     far from Gattaca - an ocean beach pounded by an angry, black
     sea.  Jerome picks up a sharp piece of shell and slices the end
     of his thumb.  A drop of blood oozes out.  He offers the shell
     to Anton but Anton does not take it.

     Both men begin to disrobe.  The brothers stand beside each other
     on the sand once again - Anton still the more athletically-built
     of the two.

     Together, they enter the raging surf.  Diving through the
     breaking waves, they begin to swim.

     In the moonlit night, we watch their two bodies swimming side by
     side.  They swim a long distance, Anton waiting for his brother
     to tire.  But the pace does not slacken.  Anton pulls up in the
     water.  Sensing his brother is no longer beside him, Jerome also
     pulls up.  They tread water several yards apart.

                           ANTON
                      (attempting to conceal his distress)
              How are you doing this, Vincent?  How
              have you done any of this?

                           JEROME
              Now is your chance to find out.

     Jerome swims away a second time.  Anton is forced to follow
     once again.  Angry now, gritting his teeth, Anton calls
     upon the same determination we have witnessed during his
     constant swimming in the pool.  He puts on a spurt, slowly
     reeling in Jerome.

     Anton gradually draws alongside Jerome, certain that this effort
     will demoralize his older brother.  But Jerome has been foxing -
     waiting for him to catch up.  Jerome smiles at Anton.  With
     almost a trace of sympathy, he forges ahead again.  Anton is
     forced to go with him.  They swim again for a long distance.

     It is Anton who gradually becomes demoralized - his strokes
     weaken, his will draining away.  Anton pulls up, exhausted and
     fearful.  Jerome also pulls up.  However his face displays none
     of Anton's anxiety.

     They tread water several yards apart.  The ocean is choppier
     now.  The view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the
     peaks of the waves.

                           ANTON
                      (panic starting to show)
              Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out.
              We have to go back!

                           JEROME
                      (calling back)
              Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.

     Anton looks towards the empty horizon.

                           ANTON
              What other side?  How far do you want to go?!
              Do you want to drown us both?
                      (becoming hysterical)
              How are we going to get back?!

     Jerome merely smiles back at his younger brother, a disturbingly
     serene smile.

                           JEROME
                      (eerily calm)
              You wanted to know how I did it.  That's
              how I did it, Anton.  I never saved anything
              for the swim back.

     Anton stares at Jerome, aghast.  The two men face each other in
     silence, treading water several yards apart in the dark, rolling
     ocean.

     Jerome turns and heads back towards the shore.  Anton is left
     alone with the terrifying realization.  The only sound, the wind
     and the water.


     EXT.  CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     JEROME, dishevelled and distressed, arrives back at the
     condominium.  He notices IRENE standing at the edge of the pool.

     She turns.  He approaches her.  They stand several yards apart.
     Looking into each other's eyes, they do not speak.  Jerome
     abruptly pulls a hair from his head - for once one of his own.

                           JEROME
                      (wry smile, offering the hair to Irene)
              Here, take it.

     Irene takes the hair, the significance not lost on her.

                           JEROME
                      (echoing Irene's words from
                      their first encounter)
              If you're still interested, let me know.

     Irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment, then
     deliberately lets it fall to the ground.

                           IRENE
                      (never taking her eyes from him, echoing
                      Jerome's words from their first encounter)
              Sorry, the wind caught it.

     Once again there is not a breath of wind.  The hair lies,
     plainly visible on the edge of the pool.

     From an upstairs window, EUGENE observes the couple.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     We watch the silhouette of IRENE and JEROME making love in
     the bedroom.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE, sitting in his darkened room, unscrews the cap of a
     plastic container and places it on a nearby table.  We remain
     on Eugene's face as he opens his fly.


     INT.  JEROME'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     IRENE and JEROME lie in bed together after making love.  For
     once Jerome is able to sleep unconcerned.  It is Irene who lies
     awake, head against JEROME'S chest, listening to the sound of
     his erratically beating heart.  However it has a soothing
     effect on her.

     She kisses Jerome and reluctantly rises from the bed.

                           JEROME
                      (awakening)
              A year is a long time.

                           IRENE
              Not so long--just once around the sun.

     Jerome smiles.  For once Irene seems to be looking forward
     to the trip.  She exits the room.


     INT.  INCINERATOR.  MORNING.

     Inside the incinerator, JEROME scrapes away at himself - for the
     final time.  He wistfully regards the brush in his hand.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  MORNING.

     JEROME, dressed for his departure, emerges down the spiral
     staircase into Eugene's condo.  Jerome notices several suitcases
     at the foot of the stairs.

     EUGENE wheels into the room.

                           EUGENE
              I have your samples ready.

                           JEROME
                      (confused)
              Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples
              where I'm going.

                           EUGENE
                      (meeting Jerome's gaze)
              No, but you might need them when you get back.

     Eugene wheels across the room and opens the mirrored door.  The
     water vapor billows out.  Jerome regards Eugene.

     Eugene leads Jerome inside for the first time.

     Inside are two rows of four identical, industrial refrigerators.
     They contain thousands of blood and urine specimens.

     Jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease.

                           EUGENE
              Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.

     EUGENE points out an extra specimen of semen in the first
     refrigerator.

                           EUGENE
              There's an extra specimen.  I wish I
              could give it to her myself.
                      (afterthought)
              But then, you always were better at being me.

     Eugene leads the way out of the refrigerator room.

                           JEROME
                      (struggling to come to terms
                      with the discovery)
              Why have you done this?

                           EUGENE
                      (as he seals the mirrored door)
              In case you get back before I do.

                           JEROME
              Where are you going?

                           EUGENE
                      (glancing to the suitcases)
              I'm travelling too.

     Jerome goes to question Eugene's travel plans but thinks better
     of it.  He kneels before his friend and embraces him.

                           JEROME
              Thank you.

                           EUGENE
              I got the better end of the deal.  I just
              lent you my body--you lent me your dream.

     Jerome smiles and hugs Eugene a final time.  Eugene stuffs an
     envelope into Jerome's pocket.

                           EUGENE
                      (referring to the note,
                      glancing heavenwards)
              Not until you're upstairs.

     Jerome exits.  Eugene watches him go.


     INT.  GATTACA - DEPARTURE LOUNGE.  NIGHT.

     JEROME enters a large holding area along with his other eleven
     CREW MEMBERS.

     Jerome's heart sinks as he recognizes LAMAR, greeting the crew
     for one final unexpected substance test.  His colleagues
     groan good-naturedly but it is clearly far more than an
     inconvenience to Jerome.  He looks towards the door he has just
     entered but there is no way back.  One by one the crew are
     ushered behind a screen.  Before he can think of a way out, it
     is Jerome's turn.  He enters the cubicle.

                           JEROME
                      (as he takes the plastic cup from Lamar)
              What's this, Lamar?

                           LAMAR
              New policy.

     From behind, we see Jerome unzip his fly.  However for once
     Jerome does not urinate on cue - unused to operating his own
     equipment in front of the physician.

                           LAMAR
                      (intrigued by the
                      out-of-character discharge)
              Flight got you nervous?

                           JEROME
              There's a problem, Lamar.

                           LAMAR
                      (apparently not listening)
              Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's
              a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.

     Jerome realizes he has no choice.  Resigned to his fate, he
     begins to fill the cup.

                           JEROME
                      (as he urinates)
              Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up
              and back and nobody would have been the wiser--

                           LAMAR
                      (cutting him off)
              --Unfortunately my son's not all that they
              promised.  But then, who know what he could do.

     Lamar takes the cup from Jerome in his gloved hand.  Jerome
     anxiously watches his sample poured into the analyzer.

     Confirming Jerome's worst fears, the face of 20-YEAR-OLD VINCENT
     appears on the computer screen.  However Lamar does not look at
     the screen.  He stares Jerome in the eye.

                           LAMAR
              For future reference--
                      (a brief glance to where
                      Jerome has just zipped his fly)
              --righthanded men don't hold it with their
              left.  It's just one of those things.

     Never lookig at the screen, Lamar presses a button marked,
     "VALID".

                           LAMAR
                      (knowing smile)
              Have a safe trip, Vincent.

     Jerome exits up a long enclosed escalator, realizing that Lamar
     has known all along.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     EUGENE knocks back a vodka.  With a certain reverence he places
     his silver medal around his neck.


     INT.  ESCALATOR.  NIGHT.

     At the top of a long escalator, the door to a craft is secured.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM.  NIGHT.

     Eugene's wheelchair, empty, sits beside the door of the
     incinerator, also secured.


     EXT.  LAUNCHPAD.  NIGHT.

     A CLOSE UP of the flame of a rocket's engines igniting - the
     ball of fire engulfs the launchpad - filling the screen.


     INT.  EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM - INCINERATOR.  NIGHT.

     Inside the incinerator another ball of fire - this time
     engulfing the unseen figure of EUGENE.  We glimpse the medal
     around his neck, melting in the fierce blaze.


     EXT.  GATTACA - LAUNCHPAD.  NIGHT.

     As we have seen so often in the past, a rocket launches into
     the sky over Gattaca - however on this occasion it carries
     Jerome.


     INT.  SPACECRAFT.  NIGHT.

     We focus on JEROME's face - seeing little if any of the craft.
     Jerome's eyes are closed.  His head is still - alarmingly still.
     Could the launch itself have been too much for him?  He hear the
     thoguhts in his head.

                           JEROME (VO)
              We came from the stars so they say, now
              it's time to go back.  If I was conceived
              today, I would not get beyond eight cells,
              and yet here I am.  In a way they were
              right, I don't have the heart for this world.
                      (pause)
              The question is, why am I having so much
              trouble dying?

     Jerome's eyes blink open.  He holds the letter from Eugene in
     his hand.  It contains no words, merely a lock of EUGENE'S hair
     - for once preserved solely for its sentimental value.  The
     hair, weightless, floats off the page.

     We focus on a porthole looking out upon a starscape.


     A STARSCAPE

     As we pan across the constellations, a title is superimposed
     upon the starscape:

              In a few short years, scientists will
              have completed the Human Genome Project,
              the mapping of all the genes that make
              up a human being.

              After 4 billion years of evolution by the
              slow and clumsy method of natural selection,
              we have now evolved to the point where we
              can direct our own evolution.

     The first title is replaced in the heavens by a second title.

              If only we had aquired this knowledge
              sooner, the following people would never
              have been born:

     A succession of portraits and photographs of RENOWNED and
     HISTORIC FIGURES fades in and out of the constellations - the
     accompanying titles list their affliction rather than their
     accomplishments.

                               HOMER
                         Blind from birth

                         NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
                              Epileptic

                               COLETTE
                              Arthritic

                              LOU GERHIG
                      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
                         (Lou Gerhig's Disease)

                             RITA HAYWORTH
                         Alzheimer's Disease

                             HELEN KELLER
                            Blind and deaf

                           STEPHEN HAWKING
                        Lou Gerhig's Disease

                         JACKIE JOYNER-KERSEE
                             Asthmatic

                           CHARLES DARWIN
                          Chronic invalid

     The face of Charles Darwin fades off and another title appears
     out of the stars.

              Even Charles Darwin, the man who told of
              the survival of the fittest, numbered
              amongst our frailest.

     The title fades off and is replaced by one final title in the
     night sky.

              Of course, the other birth that would
              surely never have taken place is your own.

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

				GREER
		I bet you did.

				MURPHY
		Candy?

				EPPS
		It's my pen name.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

				GREER
		Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

				MURPHY
		Red sky in morning, sailor take 
		warning.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
	under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS
			(lying)
		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

				MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
		Yeah.

				GREER
		There's a large vessel out about ten 
		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an 
		hour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
		raise it on the radio either. Makes 
		me think it might be in trouble.

				MURPHY
		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright 
	point of light in the middle of nowhere.

	Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio

	Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on 
	the screen.

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be 
		doing up here? It's way out of the 
		lanes. There's not a port for 800 
		miles.

				DODGE
		Smugglers maybe.

				GREER
		Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

	A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

				MURPHY
		Merchant vessel at position one seven

	Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.

				GREER
		Call the Coastguard?

				MURPHY
		Steer to one eight five. Let's check 
		her out.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

	Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

				MURPHY
		How she got out here is one hell of 
		a good question.
			(a long beat, then)
		Jesus.

	Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
	other end.

				GREER
		What is it?

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy.

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy, goddamit.

				MURPHY
			(finally)
		Sorry.

	Another beat in silence.

				GREER
		What is it?

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

				MURPHY
			(jumping down)
		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million 
		bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
		more. Could be a lot more.
			(a beat)
		What I'm proposing is... we split it 
		four ways.

	A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

				MURPHY
		Think about it. A million bucks a 
		piece.
			(a beat)
		You want to spend the rest of your 
		days drag-assing tank barges on the 
		gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's 
		get to work.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - STERN WINCH - DAY

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of 
	the boat under the power winch.

				DODGE
		Okay. We're gonna use a heavier than

	He indicates the bow of the Chimera.

				DODGE
		Then we'll all be doomed. Any other

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally)
		Hit it!

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills 
	out of the anchor alley before Epps.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat 
	toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and 
	stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek 
	dangerously close to his face, until...

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor 
	alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A 
	beat as she holds there.

		Dodge? You alright?

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

				DODGE
		Yes!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down 
	into the water and come up again from the water to the tow 
	anchor on the tug's stern.

	Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by. He raises his 
	walkie.

				DODGE
		Alright, skipper, real easy.

	Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward. He turns 
	to see as the Chimera drops back behind them.

		Throttle back.

	The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water.

				DODGE
		More.

	The tug slows still more.

				DODGE
		More.

	It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and 
	the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water, 
	straightening as the slack is pulled out.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught 
	in the anchor alleys of the Chimera.

	Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand 
	over the map table.

				MURPHY
		With a little extra fuel, weather 
		permitting, we should make Sitka in 
		five days without another stop.

				DODGE
		Sounds reasonable.

				GREER
		Hypothetically speaking, what if we

		somebody wants it back?

				DODGE
		They shoulda thought of that when

				GREER
		I don't care what, ain't nobody just 
		gonna let us walk away with a ship 
		that size.

				MURPHY
		The law's on our side. If they want

		I'd sure like to get my hands on the

	Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.

				GREER
		That must be the old man right there.

	The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man 
	from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.

	Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

				EPPS
		Coffee?

				MURPHY
			(sitting up)
		Yeah. Thanks.

	She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back 
	from the Chimera.

				EPPS
			(taking a seat)
		What'd you find up there?

				MURPHY
		Some charts. A crew manifest.
			(looking them over)
		Looks like her last voyage was January 
		1953. The question is where the hell's 
		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane 
	hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.  
	Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

				MURPHY
		What's this?

				DODGE
		Turbine rotor's shot.

				MURPHY
		I thought you said it was just a 
		blade.

				DODGE
		Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace 
		the whole deal.

				MURPHY
		How much longer's that gonna take?

				DODGE
		Like I always say --

				MURPHY
		I know I know, two ways to do anything --

				DODGE
		The right way and the wrong way.

				MURPHY
		But how long?

				DODGE
		Hard to say.

				MURPHY
		We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A 
		storm blows up and we're history.

				DODGE
		I'm telling you, you don't want to 
		be running that fan like it is.

				MURPHY
		What about running number two by 
		itself?

				DODGE
		It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
		couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
		ice with it.

				MURPHY
		How long, then?

				DODGE
		I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
		everything in a new rotor -- .

				MURPHY
		How long?

				DODGE
		Three, four days.

				MURPHY
		Goddamit, Dodge.

				DODGE
		What do you want me to tell you, 
		that we can throw this sucker back 
		in and start pulling her like nothing 
		happened? Can't do it, skipper.

	A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right.

	A beat as they hold there, thinking about it.

				MURPHY
		Obviously it's some kind of screw 
		up. The shipping records aren't a 
		hundred percent accurate.

				DODGE
		Man, it gives me the creeps. We got 
		no business towing a ship that size 
		anyway. I say we fix the turbines 
		and hit the highway.

				GREER
		Are you crazy? Do you realize we got 
		ourselves a ship? We own a ship, 
		Dodge.

				DODGE
		Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have 
		been lost at sea fifty years ago. 
		You don't think that's just a little 
		freaky?

				EPPS
		If this thing turns out to be a ship

				DODGE
		Yeah, well how the hell you get

				MURPHY
		We all want to get outa here, Dodge. 
		Especially me. With that boat in

	A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

	A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming 
	to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates 
	to Dubayy.

	Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows 
	the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz 
	into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as 
	he looks on at it.

	He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He 
	empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts 
	from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks 
	over the passenger manifest.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY

	Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last 
	night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of 
	the papers inside.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads 
	in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he 
	skins his knuckles.

				DODGE
		Fucker!

				GREER
		Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a 
		piece of metal.

				DODGE
			(inspecting his skinned 
			knuckles)
		Damn mind of it's own.

				GREER
			(seeing Murphy)
		Morning, skipper.

	Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.

				MURPHY
		Morning.

				GREER
		You're up late.

				MURPHY
		Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. 
		Where's Epps?

				DODGE
		Went aboard.

				MURPHY
		She take a radio?

				GREER
		Yeah.

	Murphy nods. A beat.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
	into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
	steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
	about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
	CAN BE HEARD.

	A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
	sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
	TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
	her, now silent.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door 
	where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through 
	it.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port 
	holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming 
	pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating 
	bizarre patterns.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs 
	there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie 
	on the floor.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

	INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment 
	circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine 
	ball.

	She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera 
	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 
	4' stack of gold ingots.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		What the fuck we gonna do with it?

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all 
		ours.

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

				MURPHY
		The sooner we get under way, the 
		sooner we are to spending what's 
		ours.

	Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space 
	beyond the twisted hatch.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty. Two twenty one.
			(as Epps stacks the 
			last one)
		Two twenty two.

	Greer makes a note.

				GREER
		Two hundred twenty two kilograms of 
		solid gold.

				EPPS
		That's what I call a payday.

				GREER
		Hell yeah.

	They slap hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door 
	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
	on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
	curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

				GREER

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Hard to say.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United

			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY

		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

			 THE END

							 FADE IN

	INT. BARGE - DAY

	Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps 
	down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, 
	oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel 
	and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

	INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light 
	on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She 
	kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking 
	in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

	EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a 
	rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean 
	by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. 
	It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which 
	means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
	west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way 
	forward.

	EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel 
	smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

	Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and 
	professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific 
	Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her 
	true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts 
	and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be 
	considered pretty.

	She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches 
	to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto 
	the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the 
	bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing 
	that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward 
	the tug at the other end.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

	DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's 
	name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge 
	(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy 
	coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate 
	Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's 
	first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering 
	red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the 
	north.

	They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable 
	occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a 
	passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern 
	where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

				EPPS
		It's a slow leak.

	She unclips and drops to the deck.

				GREER
		What's slow?

				EPPS
		Maybe twenty gallons an hour.

				DODGE
		Where from?

				EPPS
		Amidships starboard at the beam.  
		Just under the waterline. I don't 
		think it's a problem.

				GREER
		Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think 
		it's a problem.

				DODGE
		I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar 
	and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, 
	pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and 
	most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that 
	every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to 
	bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

				GREER (V.O. RADIO)
		Greer to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(lifting the radio)
		Go.

	Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up 
	at him from the stern.

				GREER
		The number nine on the starboard 
		side's half flooded. Epps says it's 
		a slow leak just under the waterline, 
		about twenty gallons an hour. They 
		must've pumped it before we left 
		Sitka.

				MURPHY
		Of course they did.

				GREER
		Let the buyer beware.

				MURPHY
		What do you say, Dodge?

				DODGE (V.O. RADIO)
			(taking the radio)
		If it started out at twenty an hour 
		the piece of shit'd be at the bottom 
		of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll 
		make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

	HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against 
	the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

	The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port 
	town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior 
	approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one 
	side as it moves into the harbor.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

	A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the 
	listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie 
	her up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the 
	turbines.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat 
	Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered 
	orange coveralls approach from the dock.

				VASILI
		I thought you say Tuesday.

				MURPHY
		Better late than never.

				VASILI
			(seeing the listing 
			barge)
		What's this?

				MURPHY
		You got a leak in the number nine 
		compartment.

				VASILI
		No, no. You got leak.

				MURPHY
		You pump it out and re-seam the hull, 
		she'll be good as new.

				VASILI
		That cost me twenty grand at least.

				MURPHY
		Fifteen, at the most.

				VASILI
		Twenty. You knock off twenty and 
		then we see. After my guy looks at 
		it.

	INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

	In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts 
	a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the 
	book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

				MURPHY
		You're kidding, right?

				VASILI
		You want fair pay, make hamburger 
		for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to 
		sign.

	Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

	EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

	Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

				GREER
		Not bad for dragging a leaky tub 
		half way to Russia.

				MURPHY
		He'll sell the scrap for three times 
		what he paid.

				GREER
		I must be in the wrong business.

				MURPHY
		You got that right.

				GREER
			(imitating Vasili)
		Better than "making hamburger for 
		Mickey D."

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in 
	the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the 
	pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a 
	tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads 
	a paper near-by.

	Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer 
	and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's 
	name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack 
	of hundreds.

				DODGE
		Much obliged, skipper.

	INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

	The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her 
	way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. 
	She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope 
	of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a 
	young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they 
	laugh.

	AT A TABLE

	Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them, 
	Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who 
	is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

				GREER
		Looks like Epps' gonna get some 
		tonight.

				DODGE
		With that coxswain dickhead.

				MURPHY
		You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?

				DODGE
		Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps?  
		Gimme a break.

	Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

				DODGE
		What a laugh.

	A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

				WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I'll show you, bitch!

	They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late 
	20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

				GIRLFRIEND
		You want to mess with me, I'll kick 
		your bitch ass, girl.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered 
	around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

				EPPS
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about. I just bought this guy a beer.

				GIRLFRIEND
		This "guy" is my man, honey.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene --

				GIRLFRIEND
		You, shut up.

				EPPS
			(starting off)
		Listen, I don't want any trouble, 
		okay -- ?

				GIRLFRIEND
			(stopping Epps)
		Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right 
		now.

				MURPHY
			(stepping up)
		What seems to be the trouble, ladies?

				RIVETER
		Whyn't you mind your own business, 
		chief.

	Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a 
	beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back 
	to Epps and the Girlfriend.

				MURPHY
		As I said, what seems to be the 
		trouble?

				RIVETER
		Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you 
		got your hearing aid turned down?

				MURPHY
		I heard you. But I'm choosing to 
		ignore you. Epps, let's go.

	Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking 
	Murphy by the collar.

				RIVETER
		These ladies was having themselves a 
		discussion and you're interrupting 
		it.

				MURPHY
		You got about two seconds to get 
		your paws off me, Tarzan.

				RIVETER
		Or what?

	Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks 
	in two over the Riveter's head.

	Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half 
	he still holds, shaking his head.

	The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs 
	buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds 
	some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

				MURPHY
		Epps?

	He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She 
	grabs her coat.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Wait.

	Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his 
	girlfriend.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		Darlene. It's over.

	He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes 
	as the others look on.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
		I don't love you anymore.

	Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her 
	on the back.

				COASTGUARDSMAN
			(to Epps)
		Come on, Candy. Let's get out of 
		here.

	The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy 
	and the others as he leads her out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps 
	approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring 
	in her step and a song in her heart.

				EPPS
		Morning everybody.

				GREER
		Show your tatoos to that coxswain 
		last night, did you Epps?

				EPPS
		Showed him a hell of a lot more than 
		that.

				GREER
		I bet you did.

				MURPHY
		Candy?

				EPPS
		It's my pen name.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

	Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from 
	the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

				GREER
		Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

				MURPHY
		Red sky in morning, sailor take 
		warning.

	EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising 
	under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

				DODGE
		Fuck it.

	He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her 
	cigarette, collecting her winnings.

				EPPS
		One more?

				DODGE
		Why not.

	She gathers the cards, shuffles.

				DODGE
		What is your first name?

				EPPS
		What?

				DODGE
		It just occurred to me I don't know 
		your first name. All this time and I 
		don't know it.

	She deals the cards in silence.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		What?

				EPPS
		Maureen.

				DODGE
		Maureen?

	She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

				EPPS
		What's yours?

	Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

				DODGE
		Roger.

				EPPS
		Roger?

				DODGE
		Yeah.

	She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

				DODGE
		You think that's funny

				EPPS
			(lying)
		No.

	She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

	THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward 
	through a steady chop and a mild swell.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked 
	as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks 
	the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and 
	picks up a walkie-talkie.

				GREER
			(into walkie)
		Greer to Murphy.

	Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

				MURPHY (V.O. RADIO)
		Yeah.

				GREER
		There's a large vessel out about ten 
		miles to the north-west.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his 
	radio.

				GREER
		I been watching it for close to an 
		hour and it hasn't moved. I can't 
		raise it on the radio either. Makes 
		me think it might be in trouble.

				MURPHY
		Alright. I'll be right up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright 
	point of light in the middle of nowhere.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north.

	Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge 
	standing back.

				MURPHY
		This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner 
		two. Over.

	Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio 
	speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Merchant vessel at one seven four 
		one five west, five seven seven five 
		north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior 
		whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero 
		niner two. Over.

	Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on 
	the screen.

				MURPHY
		Too deep to anchor out there.

				GREER
		Looks like it's adrift.

				EPPS
		Could be a fishing boat.

				GREER
		Too big. More like a freighter.

				MURPHY
		What the hell would a freighter be 
		doing up here? It's way out of the 
		lanes. There's not a port for 800 
		miles.

				DODGE
		Smugglers maybe.

				GREER
		Smuggling what? Tundra grass?

	A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

				MURPHY
		Merchant vessel at position one seven 
		four one five west, five seven seven 
		five north, this is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Do you copy? Over.

	Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.

				GREER
		Call the Coastguard?

				MURPHY
		Steer to one eight five. Let's check 
		her out.

	EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

	The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

	Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

				MURPHY
		Alright. Back it off.

	Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

				MURPHY
		Hit the lights.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly 
	illuminating the water in front of the boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the 
	light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad 
	beam of light with a joy stick.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight 
	over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, 
	when a shadow looms into view.

				MURPHY
		Whoa, whoa.

	Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow 
	looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

	As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting 
	bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness 
	above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of 
	what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come 
	around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor 
	alleys.

				MURPHY
		"Chimera."

	Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

				MURPHY
		Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera 
	rising above it.

				MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER)
		This is civilian tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior. Is there anyone aboard?

	The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy raises the mic again.

				MURPHY
		Chimera, I am hove to at your port 
		bow. Is there anyone aboard?

	They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the 
	glare of their lights.

				MURPHY
		Epps, come with me. You guys sit 
		tight.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck 
	crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against 
	the movement of the water.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen 
	making their way up under the floodlights.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps 
	jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the 
	superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, 
	lending a still darker ominousness to it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights 
	as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything 
	seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no 
	apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her 
	light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in 
	here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

				GREER
			(into radio)
		Talk to me, skipper.

	After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

				MURPHY
		We're in a stairwell just under the 
		main superstructure.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

				MURPHY
		This is definitely an old boat, maybe 
		sixty years old. She hasn't been in 
		service for at least twenty years. 
		Probably a lot longer.

	They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which 
	takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them, 
	revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen 
	equipment, a few pots still hanging.

	They move through the galley and into another, narrower, 
	passageway.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Greer and Dodge look on.

				MURPHY
		It's funny.

				GREER
		How's that?

				MURPHY
		Besides a little rust, everything's 
		pretty well-preserved.

	Greer and Dodge look at each other.

				MURPHY
		How she got out here is one hell of 
		a good question.
			(a long beat, then)
		Jesus.

	Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the 
	other end.

				GREER
		What is it?

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy.

	No answer.

				GREER
		Murphy, goddamit.

				MURPHY
			(finally)
		Sorry.

	Another beat in silence.

				GREER
		What is it?

	INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over 
	an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
		It's a passenger ship. It's a damn 
		passenger ship.

	Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate 
	opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor 
	and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier 
	hanging over it all.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge 
	meet them at the bottom.

				MURPHY
			(jumping down)
		There's nobody on that boat.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

				DODGE
		Probably slipped her moorings, got 
		tangled up in a current.

				EPPS
		Out here? What, so a seven hundred 
		foot passenger liner drifted out of 
		Spokane harbor and nobody managed to 
		bump into her until now?

				DODGE
		Somebody's probably looking for her 
		as we speak.

				MURPHY
		Whatever the reason, she's adrift 
		and abandoned. We've got every right 
		to salvage her.

				GREER
		You mean tow her back? That's a thirty 
		thousand ton ship you're talking 
		about.

				MURPHY
		We've done it before.

				DODGE
		Yeah, from one side of the harbor to 
		the other. But we got half the Bering 
		Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to 
		drag her over.

				MURPHY
		You have any idea how much a ship 
		like that could be worth in salvage? 
		The fittings alone could go for a 
		few million.

				DODGE
		If you get it back in one piece.

				MURPHY
		It's a risk I'm willing to take.

				GREER
		All we got to do is hit some rough 
		weather and you can forget about it.

				MURPHY
		So we cut her loose and wait it out. 
		A little weather couldn't be anything 
		she hasn't seen before.

				DODGE
		It's a bloody navigation hazard.  
		One boat can't control a ship that 
		size.

				MURPHY
		The damn thing's been floating around 
		for God knows how long and it hasn't 
		hit anything yet. So we take it easy. 
		A little of the old push pull.

	A long beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Listen. Forget this job's just a pay 
		check for a minute. You know I've 
		been good to you. But I'm prepared 
		to offer you something better now.
			(a beat)
		If we do this right, it's worth a 
		lot of money. A lot of money.

	They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

				EPPS
		Go on.

				MURPHY
		Salvage fees on a vessel like this 
		could come in around four million 
		bucks. At least. Who knows, could be 
		more. Could be a lot more.
			(a beat)
		What I'm proposing is... we split it 
		four ways.

	A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

				MURPHY
		Think about it. A million bucks a 
		piece.
			(a beat)
		You want to spend the rest of your 
		days drag-assing tank barges on the 
		gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's 
		get to work.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	The tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull 
	stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - STERN WINCH - DAY

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of 
	the boat under the power winch.

				DODGE
		Okay. We're gonna use a heavier than 
		usual twin cable rig this time, 
		consisting of a pair of number three 
		gauge braided wire tows.

	He indicates the bow of the Chimera.

		Supposing one of those cables breaks 
		under tow.

				DODGE
		Then we'll all be doomed. Any other 
		questions?

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer 
	operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables 
	dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the 
	starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes 
	his face out from the other side.

				DODGE
		Ready?

				EPPS
		Bring it on, dude.

	Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with 
	a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through 
	the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of 
	the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten 
	it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

				EPPS
		OK.

	Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable 
	through the anchor alleys.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally)
		Hit it!

	Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow 
	cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's 
	hull with a shower of black rust.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot 
	cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor 
	alley.

	It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks 
	it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism 
	and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable, 
	entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the 
	deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills 
	out of the anchor alley before Epps.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat 
	toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and 
	stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek 
	dangerously close to his face, until...

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor 
	alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A 
	beat as she holds there.

				EPPS
		Dodge? You alright?

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

				DODGE
		Yes!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down 
	into the water and come up again from the water to the tow 
	anchor on the tug's stern.

	Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by. He raises his 
	walkie.

				DODGE
		Alright, skipper, real easy.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward. He turns 
	to see as the Chimera drops back behind them.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The tug moves slowly away from the Chimera as Epps, Greer

		Throttle back.

	The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water.

				DODGE
		More.

	The tug slows still more.

				DODGE
		More.

	It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and 
	the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water, 
	straightening as the slack is pulled out.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught

	Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand 
	over the map table.

				MURPHY
		With a little extra fuel, weather 
		permitting, we should make Sitka in 
		five days without another stop.

				DODGE
		Sounds reasonable.

				GREER
		Hypothetically speaking, what if we 
		get this boat to Sitka and find out 
		somebody wants it back?

				DODGE
		They shoulda thought of that when 
		they let her float away.

				GREER
		I don't care what, ain't nobody just 
		gonna let us walk away with a ship 
		that size.

				MURPHY
		The law's on our side. If they want 
		to challenge it, let them try.

				EPPS
		They must've scuttled it. Nobody 
		just lets a ship float away.

				DODGE
		Nobody just scuttles a passenger 
		liner either.

				EPPS
		Ever heard of insurance, big boy?

				MURPHY
		Either way, we found it. It's ours

	An EXPLOSIVE THUD shudders the boat. They look to each other.

		What the...

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another LOUD THUMP 
	BLOWS OUT OF THE TURBINE VENTS, SHOWERING OIL OVER THE DECK.

		ALL STOP! ALL STOP!

	behind. Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks 
	inside.

				DODGE
		Mother fucker!

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		Threw a turbine blade.

	Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum 
	intake blade, hot to the touch.

				DODGE
		Son of a bitch!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck.

				DODGE
		The number one turbine's pretty well

				MURPHY
		How long to fix?

				DODGE
		Hard to say. I gotta get in there 
		and have a look. At least a couple

	Murphy, Epps, and Greer top a staircase out onto a long,

	The forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before 
	them and the rusting foredeck about 150 feet below. Light 
	from the windows illuminates the bridge as Murphy, Greer and 
	Epps look around. Despite a little corrosion and a layer of 
	dirt, everything seems in its place.

				MURPHY
			(looking through 
			scattered charts and 
			papers)
		I'd sure like to get my hands on the 
		general log.

	Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.

				GREER
		That must be the old man right there.

	The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man 
	from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.

				EPPS
		Looks like one hell of a stick up

				GREER
		He'd let you off at the nearest port,

		Lemme see.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

	Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera 
	disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights.  
	Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

				EPPS
		Coffee?

				MURPHY
			(sitting up)
		Yeah. Thanks.

	She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back 
	from the Chimera.

				EPPS
			(taking a seat)
		What'd you find up there?

				MURPHY
		Some charts. A crew manifest.
			(looking them over)
		Looks like her last voyage was January 
		1953. The question is where the hell's 
		she been since.

				EPPS
		She was sailing up north, right?

				MURPHY
		Her destination was Halifax, yeah.

				EPPS
		Well, suppose she got a little further 
		north than she should have.  Got 
		stuck in the ice. The passengers and 
		crew evacuated. She froze into the 
		ice pack, which moved further north, 
		where it froze in solid. They write 
		it off. Fifty years later, the whole 
		global warming thing happens. The 
		ice melts, she gets loose and floats 
		around til somebody runs into her.

	Murphy nods, considering it.

				MURPHY
		As reasonable an explanation as any, 
		I guess.

	Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

				MURPHY
		Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		She was a two-masted brig boat sailing 
		out of New York in 1872.  One day 
		she was sighted off the coast of 
		Portugal by a merchant vessel, the 
		Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei 
		Gratia got closer, they discovered 
		that no one was at the helm of the 
		Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found 
		her completely deserted. The captain, 
		his wife, their daughter, and the 
		entire crew, all gone. The last entry 
		in their log made no mention of any 
		trouble. The table was even set for 
		dinner. And in the nine days after 
		the last entry, she sailed 700 miles 
		without anyone aboard.

				EPPS
		So what did happen?

				MURPHY
		Nobody knows. There've been a lot of 
		theories, of course. But we'll never 
		really know for sure.

				EPPS
		You think she's sailing without a 
		crew?

	Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

				MURPHY
		I think we'd be surprised where a 
		drifting ship might wind up with a 
		little wind and the right current.

				EPPS
		You're more practical than 
		superstitious.

				MURPHY
		Only way to be.

	Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the 
	rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane 
	hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.  
	Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

				MURPHY
		What's this?

				DODGE
		Turbine rotor's shot.

				MURPHY
		I thought you said it was just a 
		blade.

				DODGE
		Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace 
		the whole deal.

				MURPHY
		How much longer's that gonna take?

				DODGE
		Like I always say --

				MURPHY
		I know I know, two ways to do anything --

				DODGE
		The right way and the wrong way.

				MURPHY
		But how long?

				DODGE
		Hard to say.

				MURPHY
		We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A 
		storm blows up and we're history.

				DODGE
		I'm telling you, you don't want to 
		be running that fan like it is.

				MURPHY
		What about running number two by 
		itself?

				DODGE
		It's a full 2500 horses down. We 
		couldn't drag that boat down hill on 
		ice with it.

				MURPHY
		How long, then?

				DODGE
		I gotta pull the blades and re-seat 
		everything in a new rotor -- .

				MURPHY
		How long?

				DODGE
		Three, four days.

				MURPHY
		Goddamit, Dodge.

				DODGE
		What do you want me to tell you, 
		that we can throw this sucker back 
		in and start pulling her like nothing 
		happened? Can't do it, skipper.

		Man, it gives me the creeps. We got

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

	Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables 
	and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from 
	windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She 
	walks on.

	A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry 
	decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, 
	reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, 
	lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.  
	And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY 
	SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an 
	instant it is there and gone.

	She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She 
	turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing 
	to be seen now.

	INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares 
	into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps 
	steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered 
	about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK 
	CAN BE HEARD.

	A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the 
	sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the 
	TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the 
	doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, 
	coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see 
	is an ancient grandfather clock.

	All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, 
	but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

	Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the 
	TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces 
	her, now silent.

	bizarre patterns.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm 
	sea.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to 
	see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive 
	diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment 
	where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to 
	the ceiling.

	INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over 
	her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing 
	passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into 
	the depths of the ship.

	Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, 
	apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on 
	loading palettes.

	In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps 
	comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to 
	reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat 
	of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly 
	preserved.

	Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more 
	wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' 
	eye.

	A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, 
	as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

	Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her 
	light inside.

	A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the 
	shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She 
	swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object 
	between broken wood slats.

	Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The 
	yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away 
	some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram 
	ingot of gold.

	She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the 
	years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack 
	of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides 
	away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to 
	see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high 
	and five feet across.

	A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in 
	gold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

	The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x

	Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

				GREER
		What the fuck you think we gonna do 
		with it? It's ours, baby. It's all

	Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

				GREER
		How much you figure that's worth, 
		skipper?

				MURPHY
			(still looking it 
			over)
		Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty 
		million.

				GREER
		Ho, baby!

				EPPS
		That's a lot of money for somebody 
		to just let float away.

	Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

				MURPHY
		Yes, it is.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		It's a hell of a lot of money.

				DODGE
		What, you think there's something 
		funny about it?

				MURPHY
		A ship with fifty million dollars in 
		gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems 
		to care enough to come looking for 
		it?

				GREER
		If they thought it was lost at sea, 
		they probably just wrote it off.

				MURPHY
		Not for fifty million. An ocean liner 
		maybe. But fifty million in gold, 
		they come looking for.

				EPPS
		Maybe they didn't want it back.  
		Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.

				MURPHY
		Maybe. But there's always somebody 
		whose interest's at stake.

				GREER
		All I gotta say is it looks like 
		that somebody's us right now.

	Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

				EPPS
		And it looks like somebody got here 
		before us too.

	The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it 
	back from the wall.

				DODGE
			(inspecting it)
		Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell 
		you that. Torn parts rusted bad as 
		the rest of the boat.

				MURPHY
		Then it happened before they scuttled 
		her.

				EPPS
		You mean, before she sank.

				GREER
		Cargo like this could make a crew 
		think twice.

				MURPHY
		That it could.

	A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

	After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the 
	galley table.

				GREER
		Then why didn't they take it.

				EPPS
		Probably didn't have time.

				DODGE
		Or somebody stopped them.

				MURPHY
		Either way, they must've had a pretty 
		good reason.

				GREER
		Must be a damn good reason to jump 
		ship and leave fifty million dollars 
		aboard.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So what're we gonna do. That's the 
		big question, right?

				MURPHY
		A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's 
		as valid as a claim to the vessel 
		itself. It's ours.

				DODGE
		Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy 
		stinking rich.

				MURPHY
		It looks like it.

	A beat as they let this sink in.

				GREER
		So what? We gonna unload the gold 
		and get a move on?

				MURPHY
		We leave it where it is. Stick to 
		the plan.

				DODGE
		You gotta be kidding? What the hell 
		we need that tub for, we got fifty 
		million bucks?

				MURPHY
		So we get a little more for the boat. 
		Besides, the gold'll be safer where 
		it is.

				GREER
		Yeah, but we still gotta haul that 
		big piece of shit all the way back 
		to Sitka.

				MURPHY
		It's worth the effort. Believe me.  
		Besides we're gonna need her to prove 
		the salvage.

				EPPS
		Why not call for help?

				MURPHY
		For now the best thing we can do is 
		to keep quiet about this.

				DODGE
		Last thing we want is extra partners.

				EPPS
		Or uninvited guests.

				GREER
		I heard that.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

	marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in 
	dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the 
	windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is 
	ordered and in its place.

	Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind 
	it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the 
	drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and 
	protractor amidst other sundry items.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in 
	on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered 
	curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of 
	slippers lie beneath it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - 
	DAY

	Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with 
	time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the 
	shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on 
	at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an 
	EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the 
	ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior 
	is tied.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising 
	from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to 
	the deck.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open 
	hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, 
	coming to the engine room door.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and 
	black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an 
	extinguisher of his own.

	The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, 
	the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a 
	cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

	Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and 
	hands singed.

	An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through 
	the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in 
	fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

				DODGE
			(over the roar)
		Murphy!

	Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge 
	turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

				DODGE
		Propane tanks're gonna go!

	Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to 
	the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher 
	into them, holding it there.

	The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning 
	his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again 
	as clouds of halon rise up.

	Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge 
	fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the 
	wall again.

	Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine 
	well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the 
	deck, and finally out.

	They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with 
	smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, 
	but the fire is out.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned 
	leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

				DODGE
		One minute I'm minding my own 
		business, the next thing I know the 
		whole place is burning up.
			(taking a drag)
		An oxygen tank must've blown on the 
		welder. Started an oil fire.

				GREER
		Looks like it took out the backup 
		genny too.

				MURPHY
		Terrific.

	Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

				MURPHY
		How's that leg?

	Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

				DODGE
		Seen better -- Ow!

	Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

				EPPS
		This's gonna hurt a little.

				DODGE
		Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!

	Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

				GREER
		What now?

				MURPHY
		We could call for help.

				GREER
		And get a bunch of fools sniffin' 
		around here?

				EPPS
		What other choices have we got?

				DODGE
		I tell you one thing, we're not gonna 
		be towing no ship now.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, this is 
		tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha 
		sierra bravo four zero niner two. 
		Radio check. Over.

	A moment, then:

				COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO)
		Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic 
		Warrior. This is United States 
		Coastguard Station North Island. 
		Your radio check is affirmative. 
		Over.

				MURPHY
		Roger that, North Island. Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over and out.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and 
	takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under 
	the stark light of a gas lantern.

				GREER
		Fifty million four ways. That's twelve 
		million and change a piece.  What 
		you gonna do with your share, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Not much at all, I guess. Retire.  
		Live out my golden years and all 
		that.

				DODGE
		I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger.  
		Spend my time hauling rich Seattle 
		business men through the Puget.

				MURPHY
		How about you Epps?

				EPPS
		Guess I'll just keep working.

				DODGE
		What're you crazy?

				EPPS
		I like my job.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

				GREER
		Moving to Sweden.

				DODGE
		What's so great about Sweden?

				GREER
		It's a beautiful country. Very clean. 
		Very civilized. And cold.

				EPPS
		That's a good thing?

				GREER
		Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder 
		the better.

				DODGE
		Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish 
		girls you only gonna dream about.

				GREER
		We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.

				MURPHY
		Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be 
		doing if we don't get this boat 
		running.

				DODGE
		Yeah, yeah.

	A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS 
	OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

				GREER
		What the hell is that?

	The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE 
	EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on 
	the bow.

				EPPS
		It's coming from inside.

	They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

				DODGE
		Sounds like the hull.

				MURPHY
		Warm water current maybe, making the 
		metal expand.

				GREER
		That shit is seriously bizarre.

	The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

	The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in 
	halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of 
	sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden 
	crate of other supplies he's gathered.

	INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

	Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a 
	few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from 
	curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the 
	wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten 
	velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two 
	twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and 
	are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten 
	up, fifty years ago.

	In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling 
	back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging 
	there undisturbed.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over 
	which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material 
	crumbling in her hands.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, 
	a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette 
	holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket 
	watch and fob, and a room key.

	Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds 
	a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a 
	mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the 
	folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert 
	holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, 
	presumably his wife.

	INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

	Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but 
	stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

	THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing 
	the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway 
	creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame 
	one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in 
	the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

	Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, 
	the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A 
	beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, 
	then turns to walk away.

				EPPS
		Hey!

	Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

				EPPS
		Hey, wait a minute! Hey!

	MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the 
	passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto 
	another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

	Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next 
	corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.  
	She turns back, running right into Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Take it easy, you'll live longer.

				EPPS
		Did you see him?

				MURPHY
		Who?

				EPPS
		The guy. He just came this way.

				MURPHY
		What guy?

				EPPS
		There's somebody else on this boat.

				MURPHY
		What? What the hell're you talking 
		about.

				EPPS
		I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some 
		guy.

				MURPHY
		Are you sure?

				EPPS
		Of course I'm sure. I saw him.

				MURPHY
		You sure it wasn't me?

				EPPS
		It wasn't you. It was somebody else. 
		There's somebody else aboard.

	A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

				DODGE
		Light in those passages ain't so 
		good.

				EPPS
		I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I 
		don't know who it was. But I saw 
		somebody.

				GREER
		What'd he look like?

				EPPS
		Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get 
		a good look. He was far away. But I 
		saw him. I saw him as sure as you're 
		standing there.

				DODGE
		Where's his boat, then? Where's his 
		crew? He ain't gonna be out here by 
		himself, that's for damn sure.

				GREER
		She's so big somebody could come 
		alongside her on the other side and 
		we'd never know it.

				EPPS
		Maybe that is his boat.

				DODGE
		Gimme a break.

	A beat as they sit in silence.

				MURPHY
		If somebody's aboard her already, 
		she ain't ours. She's theirs.

				DODGE
		Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam 
		for fifty years. We found her. She's 
		ours.

				MURPHY
		Not in the eyes of the law.

				EPPS
		So, we find this guy and make a deal 
		with him.

				MURPHY
		We don't exactly have the best 
		bargaining position.

				DODGE
		I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a 
		professional salvage crew going about 
		our business. What's some yahoo doing 
		way out here by himself anyway?

				MURPHY
		And what do you propose? That we 
		knock this guy off?

				DODGE
		Why not? Why the fuck not?

	A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

				DODGE
		Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. 
		We gonna let this guy just take it 
		from us? One guy?

				EPPS
		So we kill him?

				DODGE
		I'm saying we gotta do whatever we 
		gotta do to preserve our interest.

				GREER
		I don't know.

				MURPHY
		Let's just take it easy here, alright? 
		Nobody's gonna kill anybody.

				GREER
		Supposing he wants to get bad with 
		us?

				DODGE
		One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.

				EPPS
		Maybe he isn't alone.

	They consider this a moment.

				GREER
		I say we off-load some of that gold 
		now.

				MURPHY
		Would you hold on just a minute here, 
		please? Look, there's no reason to 
		panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. 
		It's a big boat.  Chances're real 
		good he doesn't even know about the 
		gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be 
		the wiser.
			(a beat)
		The gold stays where it is til we're 
		ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a 
		hell of a lot safer there than here.

				DODGE
		What if that fucker finds it before 
		we're ready to go?

				MURPHY
		We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight 
		off. Low man first.

				EPPS
		Guess that'd be me. Again.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't 
		care if you don't sleep for a week.  
		The sooner you're done, the sooner 
		we can get out of here. How's the 
		food situation?

				GREER
		Pretty low all around.

				MURPHY
		We'll have to take it easy then. I 
		don't think we'll find much aboard 
		the ship, but it's probably worth 
		looking around.

				EPPS
		Say we run into this guy again.

	A beat as they consider this.

				MURPHY
		If he's reasonable, maybe we can 
		make some kind of deal. If not.  
		We'll have to re-consider our options.

				DODGE
		Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit 
		up.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

	Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a 
	locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back 
	the shotgun and a box of shells.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

	Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several 
	shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.  
	She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.  
	Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from 
	the deck house.

				DODGE
		Pretty handy with that scatter gun, 
		Epps. You raised on a farm?

				EPPS
			(setting the safety)
		Seen a lota movies.

				MURPHY
		No cowboy shit up there, understand?

				EPPS
		No cowboy shit. Right.

	Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

				GREER
		Coffee.

				EPPS
			(pocketing it in her 
			coat)
		You're a pal.

	She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

				MURPHY
		Got your light?

				EPPS
		Yup.

				DODGE
		Smokes?

				EPPS
		Oh yeah.

	Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings 
	the shotgun on her back.

				EPPS
		See you boys later.
			(to Greer)
		Don't be late, I need my beauty rest.

	She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened 
	ship above them.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

	A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps 
	approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is 
	terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the 
	cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching 
	the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping 
	there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

	She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to 
	the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. 
	She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos 
	to pour herself a cup of coffee.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

	Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY 
	somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds 
	there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING 
	SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

	As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly 
	somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING 
	CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the 
	silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive 
	propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.  
	Finally she comes out into...

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

	Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She 
	continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing 
	into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

	She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.  
	Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe 
	her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again 
	echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through 
	the line of burners. Nothing moves.

	Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive 
	watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding 
	herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. 
	THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

	She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding 
	her light out before her. She comes to the end of the 
	compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still 
	closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting 
	machinery and a stack of oil drums.

	She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the 
	BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

	She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady 
	as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is 
	metallic and staccato.

	She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums 
	have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs 
	her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at 
	the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way 
	through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that 
	betrays a throughway to the outside.

	The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of 
	oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to 
	fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to 
	push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.  
	She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off 
	the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic 
	flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large 
	albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top 
	of the ship and freedom.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

	She settles back, exhausted.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(taking her radio)
		Epps.

				MURPHY
		You just shoot at something?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid 
		bird.

	She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, 
	when she smells something really awful.

	She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the 
	toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam 
	of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light 
	on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash 
	runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by 
	scavenging birds.

	She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on 
	something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in 
	front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with 
	wide, unseeing eyes.

	It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines 
	her light back to the headless torso.

	She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent 
	steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried 
	blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind 
	her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

	She spins around to see another body above her. Except this 
	one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam 
	pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum 
	to mouth.

	One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below 
	it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another 
	bent pipe.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

	A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various 
	rotting parts.

				GREER (O.S.)
		Ho-ly shit.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Couldn't have happened much more 
		than a month ago.

	Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the 
	remains of the headless torso.

				MURPHY
		Bodies're too fresh.

				DODGE
		Fresh ain't the first word that comes 
		to mind.

	Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through 
	it.

				MURPHY
		Greek citizen. Merchant navy.
			(standing)
		Obviously we aren't the first to 
		come across this ship. They probably 
		stumbled across it just like we did.

				GREER
		And look what happened.

				DODGE
		Damn barbaric is what it is.

				MURPHY
		Could be meant as a warning.

				GREER
		Stay away. Or else.

				EPPS
		Because of the gold.

				MURPHY
		That'd be my guess.

				DODGE
		So whoever did this might still be 
		around.

				GREER
		Maybe Epps's mystery man had something 
		to do with it.

				MURPHY
		Maybe.

	A beat as they consider the implications of this.

				EPPS
		So, what? We report this? Call the 
		Coastguard?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				DODGE
		Let's not be too hasty.

				GREER
		Yeah. Hell, what difference does it 
		make if we report it now or later?  
		We call this in now, gonna be 
		Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all 
		over the place.

	A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

				MURPHY
		Dodge, if this isn't incentive enough 
		to fix that boat, I don't know what 
		is.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life, 
	turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of 
	smoke.

				DODGE
		All the seals and gaskets're shot.  
		Anything that was rubber burned up.

	Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

				MURPHY
		Can't you use something else?

				DODGE
		I might be able to find something on 
		the ship. But it's gonna take time.

				MURPHY
		Do what you need to do. Just do it 
		fast.

				DODGE
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	Epps sleeps in her bunk.

	INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

	Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

				DODGE
		I need lag bolts, especially one 
		inch standard. And sheet metal.  
		Preferably steel, about a sixteenth 
		of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll 
		do.

				GREER
		I ain't no mechanic, just so you 
		know.

				DODGE
		You find anything that even looks 
		like a compressor. I don't care what, 
		grab it.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and 
	communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and 
	cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.  
	He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call 
	log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

	Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has 
	difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when 
	he slips.

				GREER
		Dammit!

	A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT 
	SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human, 
	somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

				GREER
		Dodge?

	He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING 
	AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

				GREER
		Dodge!

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened 
	passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it 
	echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks 
	down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through 
	a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY 
	HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me 
	your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

	He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at 
	the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He 
	moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and 
	the light falling from the open door.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log 
	book.

	On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries, 
	coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble 
	notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

	His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to: 
	"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.  
	Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

	His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.  
	Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing 
	vessel 'China Sea.'"

				MURPHY
		Captain relieved of command.

	He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final 
	entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General 
	SOS."

	He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled 
	in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL 
	OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it, 
	but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT 
	BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open, 
	but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL 
	CLOSES AGAIN.

	Murphy takes the radio.

				MURPHY
		This is Murphy. Anybody trying to 
		call me? Over.

	He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.  
	Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there, 
	but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer? Dodge?

	Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy 
	holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY, 
	STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

				VOICE (V.O. RADIO)
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know, but won't say so."

	Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if 
	someone were there but not speaking.

				MURPHY
		Who is this!!

	The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.  
	Murphy squeezes the talk button.

				MURPHY
		Greer! Dodge!

	Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD 
	CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio 
	sounds.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy.

				MURPHY
			(taking radio)
		Murphy.

				DODGE
		You better get down here quick, 
		skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.

				MURPHY
		What is it?

				DODGE
		I think you better see this for 
		yourself.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw 
	Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls 
	from the open door as he approaches.

	AT CABIN 400

	As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the 
	middle of the cabin.

				DODGE
		I found him like this.

	Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and 
	his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so 
	that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists 
	quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

	Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed, 
	his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face 
	contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering 
	nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in 
	tongues.

				GREER

		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

	AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

	As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Hard to say.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing 
	as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy 
	looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

				EPPS
		I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a 
		coma.

				DODGE
		A what?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		it. He's breathing on his own, but 
		his pupils are completely blown out. 
		He's totally unresponsive to pain.
			(a beat)
		What happened up there?

				DODGE
		I heard a scream. When I got there I 
		found him on the floor. He was having 
		some kind of seizure. I didn't see 
		anybody else.

				MURPHY
		He must've seen something.

	A beat as they consider this.

				EPPS
		Other than the obvious, there's 
		nothing wrong with him that I can 
		see, not on the outside.

				DODGE
		Then what the hell happened to him?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Just before I heard him yell there 
		was somebody on the radio.

				EPPS
		Greer?

				MURPHY
		I don't know. No. Not Greer.  
		Somebody.

	Another long beat as they think about this.

				MURPHY
		It was a man's voice. Repeating some 
		sort of children's rhyme. I don't 
		know, it didn't make any sense. You 
		didn't hear it?

				DODGE
		Not me.

	Another beat as this sinks in.

				EPPS
			(looking to Greer)
		He needs a doctor.

				MURPHY
		I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many 
		signal flares you can scrounge up.
			(to Epps, meaning 
			Dodge)
		Keep an eye on him.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as 
	he holds the radio mic.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	No response.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		United States Coastguard, United 
		States Coastguard, United States 
		Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic 
		Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo 
		four zero niner two. Over.

	Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Mayday. Mayday. Mayday. To any vessel. 
		This is Arctic Warrior.  Arctic 
		Warrior. Arctic Warrior.  Whiskey 
		alpha sierra bravo four zero niner

		person, possibly comatose. I am a 
		one hundred twenty foot civilian 
		tug, hove to at port bow of disabled 
		passenger liner Chimera. I repeat, 
		Chimera. Over.

	Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door 
	comes open and Murphy steps in.

				MURPHY
		How's he doing?

				EPPS
		Same. Any luck?

				MURPHY
		No. I'll try again later.

	A beat as they look on at Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log 
	book Murphy found in the radio room.

				EPPS
			(reading it)
		They're dead in the water that 
		morning. Four hours later the 
		captain's relieved of his command.  
		And that evening they issue a general 
		SOS.

				MURPHY
		Possibly false. Hence the IMA record 
		of being lost at sea. I don't think 
		mutiny's out of the question here.

				DODGE
			(taking a seat)
		On a passenger ship in 1953?

				MURPHY
		If they knew what they were carrying.

				EPPS
		You're saying they mutinied for the 
		gold?

				MURPHY
		If they were close enough to shore, 
		they probably figured they could get 
		away in the lifeboats.

				EPPS
		Only something must've gone wrong.

				DODGE
		Yeah, way wrong.

	A beat as they consider it.

				DODGE
		So. I got a question. Just from a, 
		you know, purely technical standpoint. 
		We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard 
		shows up. What exactly is the plan?

				MURPHY
		How do you mean?

				DODGE
		Well, they're gonna be asking a lot 
		of questions. About us. About those 
		bodies. About the gold. Seems like 
		we oughta be prepared is all.

				MURPHY
		I guess the best strategy's just to 
		tell them the truth.

				DODGE
		Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.  
		When there's more than a few hundred 
		million dollars involved, that's a 
		whole new deal.

				MURPHY
		What do you propose?

				DODGE
		For starters, getting that gold off 
		the ship. What they don't know about 
		isn't gonna bother them.

	A beat as Murphy holds there.

				MURPHY
		There's no way we're gonna hide a 
		few thousand pounds of gold from the 
		Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be 
		safer where it is.

				DODGE
		With all due respect, skipper.
			(a beat)
		Part of that up there's mine. I'd 
		kinda like to have a little say in 
		what happens to it.

	A beat as Murphy looks on.

				MURPHY
		Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get 
		back to shore, you can do whatever 
		you want with your share. But until 
		then, the gold stays right where it 
		is.

	Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of 
	coffee.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic 
	Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.  
	He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

	The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely 
	demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from 
	behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

				MURPHY
		Just what the hell do you think you're 
		doing?!

				DODGE
		I don't know what you're talking 
		about?

				MURPHY
		I think you know.

				DODGE
		Maybe you can tell me then.

	Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

				MURPHY
		The radio!

				DODGE
			(not having a clue)
		The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip.

				DODGE
		Take it easy, willya? What about the 
		radio?!

				MURPHY
		You smashed it!

				DODGE
		What?!

				MURPHY
		Don't lie to me!

				DODGE
		What the fuck -- ?

				MURPHY
		You didn't want us calling anybody.  
		Too liable to ruin your big payday.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio.

	Murphy tightens his grip still more.

				DODGE
		I didn't touch the fucking radio!
			(a beat)
		Ever occur to you there's somebody 
		else on that boat, skipper?

				MURPHY
		Conveniently enough for you.

				DODGE
		Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?

	Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting 
	him go.

				DODGE
		Jesus.

	Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

				EPPS (O.S.)
		Murphy.

	They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

				EPPS
		It's Greer.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a 
	jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to 
	see them.

				GREER
		Never been more thirsty in my life.

				MURPHY
		Drink up then.

	Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a 
	seat, looking on at him.

				MURPHY
		How're you feeling?

				GREER
		Lost my sea legs.

				EPPS
		Any dizziness?

				GREER
		No.

				EPPS
		Headache, nausea, lights?

				GREER
		Lights?

				EPPS
		Sudden flashes of light.

				GREER
		I feel fine.

				DODGE
		What day is it?

				GREER
		I don't know. Tuesday?

				DODGE
		Wrong. It's Friday.

				EPPS
		Try Wednesday.

				DODGE
		Right. Wednesday.

	A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

				GREER
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		You don't remember?

				GREER
		Last thing I remember I was aboard 
		the Chimera. Down somewhere in there 
		scavenging around.

				MURPHY
		You've been out for about a day.

				GREER
		Say what?

				MURPHY
		Dodge found you out cold in one of 
		the cabins.

	Greer only holds there.

				GREER
		Oh, man.

				MURPHY
		We heard you scream. Any idea what 
		you might've seen?

				GREER
		I wish I could tell you. I'd be real 
		interested to know myself.

	Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink 
	of water.

				MURPHY
		The ah... the radio's out.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		Somebody took it out of commission 
		last night.

	A beat as they all hold there.

				MURPHY
		Smashed it up pretty bad.

				EPPS
		But, who -- ?

				DODGE
		The skipper seems to think I did it. 
		That I'm more interested in that 
		gold than my own safety or the safety 
		of my fellow shipmates.

	A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

				EPPS
		Did you?

				DODGE
		Hell no. You think I'm crazy?

	Another beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Regardless of how it happened, there 
		isn't much of a chance to fix it. 
		The odds of another vessel in range 
		of the walkie-talkies are almost 
		astronomical. So, as of today, we're 
		pretty much on our own out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

	Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the 
	ship.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

	Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an 
	aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees 
	that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

	Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He 
	looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

	He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them, 
	yanking them loose, breaking them off.

	INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

	The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty 
	assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

	WITH EPPS

	A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten 
	corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and 
	the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees 
	that it is the ship's log.

				EPPS
		Murphy.

	Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the 
	very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

				EPPS
		Looks like part of the general log.

	Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

				EPPS
		"The crew have gone mad with greed 
		and fight among themselves like wild 
		dogs over fresh kill."

				MURPHY
		February first.

				EPPS
		The same day she supposedly went 
		down.

				MURPHY
		Must not've been the captain's entry. 
		He was probably out of the picture 
		by then.

	Epps continues to read.

				EPPS
		"Their lacking diligence has 
		undoubtedly caused the collision.  
		Distress calls have been made."

				MURPHY
		Collision? With what?

				EPPS
		The page's missing. Then their SOS 
		was real.

				MURPHY
		But where's the damage?

				EPPS
		Maybe the other ship took the worst 
		of it.

				MURPHY
		If it was a ship she hit.

	A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

				DODGE
		Dodge to Murphy!

	Murphy reaches down for his radio.

				MURPHY
			(to radio)
		Yeah.

				DODGE
		You better get down here right now!  
		We're taking water! Big time!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

	Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is 
	starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house 
	and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly 
	filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a 
	pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

				MURPHY
		What the hell happened!

				DODGE
		Turbine chamber on number two must've 
		blown! Took out part of the hull!

				GREER
		We're not gonna be able to pump it!

				MURPHY
		Alright. Everybody grab your gear!  
		This' is where we get off!

	EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash 
	with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their 
	gear to the crane.

	Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the 
	towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs 
	precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

	Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

				MURPHY
		Dodge!

	INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to 
	one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, 
	then Murphy.

	Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, 
	which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

	WITH DODGE

	Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He 
	goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the 
	starboard rail.

	He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker 
	opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to 
	pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up 
	and edges his way toward the bow.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the 
	skewed deck crane.

	WITH DODGE

	The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, 
	the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

	Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it 
	sinks lower and lower.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug 
	pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

	Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

	WITH DODGE

	As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the 
	other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

	Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach 
	as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and 
	fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming 
	close but not close enough.

	The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and 
	Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, 
	coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as 
	the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

	The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space 
	by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

	WITH THE OTHERS

	Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water 
	and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

	Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls 
	still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, 
	slipping lower and lower.

	WITH DODGE

	As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail 
	well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of 
	Dodge's hand.

	A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables 
	coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the 
	Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

	With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against 
	the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It 
	starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the 
	cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

	Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

	A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air 
	escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water 
	forces it out of the tug below decks.

	The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, 
	as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

	Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their 
	hands barely reaching.

	The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to 
	scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull 
	like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with 
	everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

	Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other 
	hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a 
	SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

	Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, 
	slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation 
	of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it 
	slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally 
	disappearing altogether into the depths.

	A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom 
	bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		That just about says it all.

	Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards 
	above the deck.

				GREER
		Rotten stem to stern. Guess you 
		couldn't expect much else.

	Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

				GREER
		We ain't exactly in what you'd call 
		your high traffic neighborhood either.

				MURPHY
		The coast guard has our last position. 
		They'll send somebody out soon enough. 
		A ship this size you can't exactly 
		miss.

				EPPS
		It's a good bet they'll be asking a 
		lot of questions when they get here 
		too.

				MURPHY
		Let 'em ask. This ship's legally 
		ours now.

				DODGE
		When they find out what it's carrying, 
		they may not be so interested in 
		what's legal.

				GREER
		Maybe you shoulda thought a that 
		before you scuttled our boat.

	Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

				DODGE
		The turbine blew.

				GREER
		Lemme see, was that before or after 
		the oil fire?

	A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

				MURPHY
			(grabbing Dodge)
		Easy, easy.

	Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

				GREER
		Gettin' a little hot under the collar, 
		I'd say.

				MURPHY
		Shut up.

				GREER
		Must be a little too the truth, eh 
		Dodge?

	Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

				MURPHY
		I said, shut the hell up.

	Murphy shoves Dodge back.

				MURPHY
		Both of you. I don't want to hear it 
		again.

	A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

				MURPHY
		So just stow it. You understand?
			(a beat)
		We don't need this right now.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer 
	sit around it in silence.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly 
	as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light 
	under it. She sits down, trying it.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

	Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the 
	stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You shouldn't be down here alone.

	Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

				DODGE
		Just wanted to check on our little 
		baby.

	A beat as they look on at the gold.

				DODGE
		That oughta buy a man pretty much 
		anything he wants.

				MURPHY
		If money can buy what he wants.

				DODGE
		I don't figure there's much I want 
		money can't buy.

				MURPHY
		Then you're a lucky man.

	Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

				MURPHY
		We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. 
		You're up first.

				DODGE
		Right.

	Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge 
	looks after him.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the 
	top deck.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding 
	broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

	INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

	Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, 
	scavenging for food.

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

	Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, 
	open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND 
	THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

		Murphy?

	No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the 
	galley. Nothing.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry 
	to the swimming pool. She walks on.

	INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

	Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at 
	the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.  
	She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a 
	GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

	Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is 
	porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her 
	clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

				GIRL
		You must leave.

	A beat as Epps stands there.

				EPPS
			(finally)
		Who are you?

	From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully 
	discern the girl's features.

				GIRL
		There's great evil here, more than 
		you can know. Leave now or you may 
		never leave.

				EPPS
		But --

	A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.  
	When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND 
	ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is 
	now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the 
	depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising 
	up from the bottom.

	She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the 
	top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when 
	the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching 
	the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red 
	glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

	As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow 
	spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear 
	that the water is not water at all but blood.

	And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is 
	illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.  
	Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It 
	is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The 
	bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

	Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same 
	point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then 
	another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately 
	to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

				EPPS
		My God....

	Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the 
	blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far 
	apart.

	She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the 
	surface.

	The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches 
	out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

				EPPS
		No!!

	Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

	The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to 
	its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking 
	on in disbelief.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		You okay?

	Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

				EPPS
		Yeah.
			(looking back to the 
			pool)
		Yeah, fine.

	A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

	Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

				DODGE
		You'd think on a ship this size 
		there'd be something left to eat.

				GREER
		After fifty years there ain't nothin' 
		left but shoe leather.

				MURPHY
		Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find 
		some line and tackle. Use some of 
		those bodies below decks for bait.

				DODGE
		There's a charming thought.

				GREER
		We can always start shooting birds.

	Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

				DODGE
		What say, Epps? You up for some 
		roasted albatross?

				EPPS
			(snuffing it out)
		Why not?

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark 
	room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that 
	it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his 
	arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and 
	he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something 
	between a night terror and a seizure.

	INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

	Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of 
	morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming 
	down when Greer steps in.

				GREER
		Looks like we're in a strong current.
			(closing the door)
		Must be making almost five knots 
		full on ass backwards.

	Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

				GREER
		Nasty little swell outa the north 
		west too.

	Murphy nods as he looks out.

				MURPHY
		Let's just hope somebody sees us 
		first out here.

	INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

	A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

	Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE 
	PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.  
	She goes through them, coming to a section that says 
	"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

	She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening 
	it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to 
	Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back 
	to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, 
	Angela age: 17.

	She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 
	11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, 
	David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming 
	to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, 
	Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: 
	"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was 
	found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall 
	steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as 
	the ship drifts into it.

	WITH GREER AND MURPHY

	They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright 
	orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as 
	the ship drifts by.

				MURPHY
		It's a Noaa buoy.

				GREER
		A what?

				MURPHY
		Government weather. It's got a 
		transmitter aboard.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, 
	Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

				MURPHY
		Let's go, let's go, let's go.

	Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

	ON THE BUOY

	As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the 
	line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook 
	it on its wind gauge.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy corrects.

				EPPS
		Higher. You're gonna miss it.

	Murphy holds the loop steady.

	ON THE BUOY

	The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy 
	drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes 
	down.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Murphy yanks on the line.

	ON THE BUOY

	And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, 
	the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy 
	heels over as it's pulled.

	ON THE BUOY

	It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging 
	the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with 
	a huge BOOMING CLANG.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing 
	bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

				GREER
		We're still drifting.

				MURPHY
		The mooring hasn't come taught.

				EPPS
		It's not gonna hold us.

				MURPHY
		Doesn't matter.

	ON THE BUOY

	As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side 
	of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

	The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its 
	mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the 
	buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own 
	mooring.

	ON THE BUOY

	The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, 
	and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the 
	creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

				DODGE
		No fucking way.

	ON THE BUOY

	The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, 
	sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain 
	of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

	BACK TO SCENE

	The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising 
	on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

				MURPHY
		Damn it.

	They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the 
	ship drifts away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

				EPPS
		Hey.

				MURPHY
		Hey.

				EPPS
		Couldn't sleep.

				MURPHY
		Wish I could say the same.

	They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

				EPPS
		What do you think happened on this 
		boat?

				MURPHY
		I guess that's the sixty four thousand 
		dollar question, isn't it?

				EPPS
		The what?

				MURPHY
		Never mind. Before your time.
			(a beat)
		I think at least some of the crew 
		went a little nuts. The usual stuff 
		that happens when people stumble on 
		a fortune. Equal parts greed and 
		paranoia, usually resulting in 
		homicide. What happened after that 
		is anybody's guess. But, judging by 
		our Greek friends down below, it 
		doesn't look like the last time.

				EPPS
		Are we smart enough to avoid that?

				MURPHY
		I don't know, are we?

	A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire, 
	watching it.

				EPPS
		When you found me yesterday, at the 
		pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.

				MURPHY
		Not our mystery guest again.

				EPPS
		No. Someone else. A girl.
			(hesitating, a beat)
		I'm not sure she was... real.

	She looks up to Murphy.

				MURPHY
		Not real?

	A beat as she only looks back.

				MURPHY
		What, like some kind of ghost?

				EPPS
		I don't know what else you'd call 
		her. One second she was there, the 
		next she was gone.

	Another beat as he looks on at her.

				EPPS
		And I had a kind of hallucination.
			(a beat)
		There were others. I saw them in the 
		pool. Drowning.

	A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

				EPPS
		Maybe hallucination is the wrong 
		word. It was more than that. As though 
		they were showing me.

				MURPHY
		Showing you what?

				EPPS
		What happened.

				MURPHY
		Maybe it was one of them did the 
		handy work on those Greeks.

				EPPS
		No. I think they are, were, just 
		passengers. Innocent victims.

				MURPHY
		Victims of what?

				EPPS
		Something bad happened here, Murphy.

				MURPHY
		That much I think we've already 
		established.

				EPPS
		More than just a mutiny. More than 
		just the gold.

	A beat as he holds there.

				EPPS
		She said the ship was evil. That we 
		had to leave right away. That if we 
		didn't, we might never leave.

				MURPHY
		What's that supposed to mean?

				EPPS
		I don't know.

	A beat as she looks back.

				MURPHY
		Why you? How come the rest of us 
		haven't seen these people?

				EPPS
		Just lucky I guess.

	Another beat as he holds on her.

				MURPHY
		Well. Getting off this ship's exactly 
		what we're trying to do.  Short of 
		that, I don't know what else to tell 
		you.

	She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

				MURPHY
		Do me a favor and wake up Dodge.  
		He's next on.

	She starts to get up.

				MURPHY
		And Epps?

	She stands, looking back at him.

				MURPHY
		You can tell the others about this.  
		But, for my money, I think it's best 
		you keep it to yourself.

	She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

				EPPS
		Dodge.
			(no answer, knocking 
			again)
		Dodge.

				DODGE (O.S.)
			(finally, from inside)
		What?

				EPPS
		Get up.

				DODGE (O.S.)
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

	Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat 
	as she holds there in the darkness.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches 
	from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of 
	water.

				MURPHY
		You're late.

				DODGE
		Sorry.

				MURPHY
			(handing him the 
			shotgun)
		Don't fall asleep.

				DODGE
			(laying out his blanket)
		Right.

	INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

	Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, 
	increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to 
	speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words 
	are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical 
	language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

	Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC 
	CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" 
	playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another 
	passageway.

	He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors 
	of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. 
	It stops.

	He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light 
	back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the 
	CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

	He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL 
	REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

				DODGE
		Dodge.

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

				DODGE
		This is Dodge. Over.

	He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN 
	THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON 
	THE RADIO:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster 
		to the crow. "Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	Dodge hits the talk button.

				DODGE
		Who is this?

	The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

				DODGE
		Identify yourself, motherfucker!

	SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

	SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far 
	end of the passageway.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy --
		.

	Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he 
	can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM 
	IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle 
	of light.

	ON SHOTGUN

	As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in 
	frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun 
	muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing 
	pulls it away.

	EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

	A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

	Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

				MURPHY
		Dodge?

	INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

	Epps shines her light on something.

				EPPS
		Check it out.

	Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They 
	are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

				GREER
		I don't even want to know what that's 
		gonna taste like now.

				EPPS
		Better than starving to death.

	Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Epps.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Epps, over.

				MURPHY
		Either of you seen Dodge?

	She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

				EPPS
		Nope.

				MURPHY
		He's not on deck and I can't raise 
		him on the radio.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

	Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct 
	as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow 
	and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

				MURPHY
		He took the shotgun and a light.

				GREER
		Must've heard something below deck 
		and went down to check it out.

	A beat as they hold there.

				MURPHY
		Alright. We stay together. Nobody 
		goes any further than earshot.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

	Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

				MURPHY
			(into radio)
		Murphy to Dodge. Murphy to Dodge.  
		Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's 
	voice can be heard on it.

				MURPHY
		Murphy to Dodge. Do you copy? Over.

	INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

	Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

				MURPHY (O.S.)
		Epps? You there?

				EPPS
		Right here.

	WITH MURPHY

	As he moves along as well, eyes open.

				MURPHY
		Greer?

	WITH GREER

	As Greer moves along too.

				GREER
		Yeah, yeah.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across 
	bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds 
	there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

				EPPS
		Murphy?

	No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN, 
	far off, unintelligible. It stops.

	She moves on, shinning her light.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight 
	before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

	Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for 
	her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint 
	it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of 
	standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING 
	CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

	It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the 
	GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

	Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with 
	a start.

				GREER
		Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

	She holds there a beat, looking around.

				GREER
		You okay?

				EPPS
		Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard 
		something is all.

				GREER
		What?

				EPPS
		Nothing. Let's get outa here.

	They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

	Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the 
	darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

	MOVING WITH EPPS

	As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and 
	low to the deck. She stops.

	WITH THE LIGHT

	As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, 
	stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She 
	reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still 
	on.

	She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the 
	darkness and starts off, Greer following.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, 
	when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

	It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, 
	inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot 
	appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

	She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to 
	see that it is blood.

	She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging 
	suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them 
	from the darkness.

	He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high 
	pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging 
	limp beside it.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

	Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides 
	it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

				GREER
		Can't find the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		So whoever did this now has our 
		shotgun.

				GREER
		Doesn't look like it much matters.

				EPPS
		What do we do with him?

				MURPHY
		Leave him till we can get some help.
			(a beat)
		From now on, nobody comes down here.

				GREER
		What about the gold?

				MURPHY
		Leave it.

				GREER
		Now hold up just a minute. Let's be 
		reasonable here.

				MURPHY
		You think whoever did this is 
		reasonable?

				GREER
		All I'm saying is that gold's worth 
		a lot more to us now than it ever 
		was.

				EPPS
		I can't believe you. Dodge's dead 
		and all you can think about is cashing 
		in your share.

				GREER
		I didn't sign up to go home empty 
		handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll 
		over for the freaky motherfucker did 
		this.

				MURPHY
		Nobody's going anywhere with that 
		gold now. Anybody tries to board, 
		we'll know about it.
			(a beat)
		You can do what you want, Greer.  
		But neither of us is gonna risk saving 
		your ass down here if it comes to 
		that.

				GREER
		Fine with me.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

	Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She 
	moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where 
	Greer was found, room 400.

	She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. 
	She opens it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though 
	spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting 
	room in the front, is a bedroom.

	Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

	A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the 
	foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the 
	process of being unpacked.

	From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other 
	contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

	Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on 
	an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a 
	few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one 
	of the books, opening it.

	Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs 
	to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

	A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a 
	children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of 
	a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle 
	doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I 
	know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny 
	whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

	She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos 
	of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the 
	mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older 
	girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, 
	KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.  
	She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly 
	plays "Daisy."

	AT THE TABLE

	Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly 
	winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, 
	looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.  
	A beat.

	The dirty white light falling into the room through the 
	windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot 
	see. His expression is empty, hollow.

				EPPS
		Greer?

	He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, 
	stepping up.

				EPPS
		You okay?

	Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly 
	turns to see her.

	A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty 
	look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes 
	hard.

	She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his 
	wrists, fighting him.

				EPPS
		Greer!

	His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make 
	little difference.

				EPPS
		Let go!

	She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching 
	with it.

				GREER
		Oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska 
		getofedobrodijotosiantosg.

	He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, 
	eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass 
	and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still 
	choking her.

	He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe 
	the rest of the way.

	Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a 
	basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, 
	a little out of reach.

	She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles 
	her.

	Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

	She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting 
	with Greer's head.

	He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks 
	in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger 
	marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

				EPPS
			(into radio)
		Murphy! I'm on C deck, cabin 400!  
		Get down here now!!

	Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.  
	She throws down the radio.

	A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's 
	dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but 
	he dives, taking her down.

	He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He 
	raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

	Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch 
	and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her 
	with his other hand.

	She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the 
	head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across 
	the floor.

	She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and 
	bleeding.

	He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his 
	waist to do God knows what.

	Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that 
	she has unhinged her gill knife.

	As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife 
	with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through 
	his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

	After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, 
	wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears 
	in the doorway.

	Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from 
	behind at full speed, knocking him down.

	Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her 
	feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over 
	Greer, bringing it down on his head.

	CUT TO BLACK

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops 
	at the bottom, now starting to come to.

	OUTSIDE

	Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel 
	pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

	Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of 
	armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in 
	the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as 
	he speaks in his nonsensical language.

				MURPHY (V.O.)
		Must've been him all along.

	Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

				MURPHY
		Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. 
		Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. 
		He's off his nut, no doubt there.

	They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

				MURPHY
		What do you think?

				EPPS
		Could be a stroke. Who knows?
			(a beat)
		The general log said the crew were 
		fighting among themselves. "Like 
		wild dogs."

				MURPHY
		Over the gold.

				EPPS
		Maybe it was more than that.

	Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He 
	presses his face to the glass.

				EPPS
		They went crazy.

				MURPHY
		Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not 
		like him.

	A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his 
	hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his 
	wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps 
	and Murphy stand over it.

				MURPHY
		We lash a few of these together it 
		might get us far enough into the 
		shipping lanes to be rescued.

	A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

				MURPHY
		Hard to say which is worse, staying 
		here or taking our chances in open 
		water.

				EPPS
		If the weather holds it might not be 
		so bad.

				MURPHY
		It's not the weather I'm worried 
		about. The wrong current could drag 
		us as far as the Aleutians before we 
		come across another boat.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

	Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into 
	a single usable raft.

	INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

	Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white 
	light from the skylight falling on him from above.

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

	Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making 
	her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.  
	The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, 
	raises the radio.

				EPPS
			(holding down talk 
			button)
		Murphy?

	She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

				EPPS
		Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy?

	Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the 
	channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable 
	presence on the other end.

				EPPS
			(raising the radio)
		Who is this?

	The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound 
	of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE 
	RADIO.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES 
	TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, 
	stopping there.

	At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

	The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the 
	MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF 
	THE CORRIDOR.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, 
	coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

	The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, 
	she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

	Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

	She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio 
	CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

				VOICE
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find 
	the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme 
	"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the 
	page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

				VOICE
		Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy. Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle 
		toy.

	On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes 
	it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA 
	SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows 
	a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across 
	the room.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so."

	On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the 
	photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor 
	with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

				MOTHER
		"Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster 
		to the crow. Where are you now? I 
		know but won't say so." Cassandra, 
		if you insist on playing that while 
		I read I'll just stop right now.

				THE GIRL
		Sorry.

	The room is warm with light, restored to its original 
	condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen, 
	no longer holding the whistle.

	A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom 
	wearing a new coat.

				FATHER
		What do you think?

				MOTHER
		He certainly did shorten it, didn't 
		he?

				FATHER
		I thought this was all the rage.

				KATIE
		Maybe last year.

	Katie joins them from the outer room.

				FATHER
		What about this year?

				KATIE
		It's not your color anyway.

				GIRL
		I like it, daddy.

				FATHER
		Well thank you!

				GIRL
		Daddy, how much longer before we 
		start moving again?

				FATHER
		They're working on the engines, honey. 
		As soon as they fix them we'll be on 
		our way.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with 
	sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and 
	objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their 
	original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE 
	HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks 
	in to see people doing various things, some packing and 
	putting their things in order.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three 
	STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift 
	him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and 
	protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

	INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the 
	galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end 
	and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen 
	among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from 
	the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their 
	neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other 
	end.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway 
	as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a 
	door slams shut.

	The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE 
	SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

	As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN 
	fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering 
	the contents.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

	Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man 
	and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD 
	takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches 
	over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

	Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 
	400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from 
	inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting 
	room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several 
	MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships 
	officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

	The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from 
	between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of 
	the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, 
	the bed rocking, the others looking on.

	Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied 
	behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of 
	the bed.

	EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

	EPPS' POV

	a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her 
	feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

	The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of 
	the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, 
	but Katie.

	The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of 
	the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

				MUTINEER
		You like that, daddy? I'll show you 
		something else now.

	The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so 
	that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe 
	over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling 
	blur --

				EPPS (V.O.)
		NO!!!!

	BACK TO SCENE

	The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the 
	room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned 
	state.

				KATIE
		It isn't real.

	Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where 
	she stands.

				KATIE
		Many bad things have happened here.  
		But you mustn't allow the evil inside. 
		I tell you this because you can see 
		me. The others can't. But you must 
		leave. You must leave.

	A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns 
	back Katie is gone.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

				MURPHY
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

				EPPS
		Epps to Murphy.

	Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out 
	onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be 
	seen.

	As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is 
	nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken 
	out.

	A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF 
	METAL follows it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged 
	mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

	The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a 
	mine field for a drifting ship.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, 
	almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas 
	duffle.

				EPPS
		What happened?

				MURPHY
		We hit land.

				EPPS
		What?

				MURPHY
		We're in an island chain. It's only 
		a matter of time before we hit another 
		one.

				EPPS
		Greer's gone. He broke out of the 
		tank.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING 
	shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as 
	it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull 
	precariously.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As 
	they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the 
	passage some distance down.

	AT THE OTHER END

	Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face 
	down in the passage.

	They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the 
	body over. It is Greer, dead.

				EPPS
		He's been shot.

	Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

				MURPHY
		Let's get the hell out of here.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

				MURPHY
		It should be enough to get us to one 
		of those islands. Gimme a hand, 
		wouldya?

	She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to 
	the rail.

				MURPHY
		Prop it here. We need to pull these 
		braces off. There's a hammer on the 
		stand. There.

	Epps crosses back to the stands.

	AT THE STANDS

	Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle, 
	folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge 
	had when he died.

	A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

				MURPHY
		I'll take that.

	A beat as she looks to Murphy.

				EPPS
		It was you.

	He only looks back at her as she stands there.

				EPPS
		You killed them.

				MURPHY
		It was only a matter of time before 
		somebody killed somebody.
			(a beat)
		You saw it coming as well as I did.  
		Dodge had his plans, starting with 
		scuttling the boat. And Greer too, 
		except he went nuts. Couldn't take 
		it, I guess. Could've happened in 
		the middle of downtown Anchorage.  
		But did it make him any less 
		dangerous? I don't think so.

				EPPS
		So you killed them?

				MURPHY
		The way I figure it, it was them or 
		me. I thought putting Dodge up on 
		that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a 
		little time. Made it look like whoever 
		killed those Greeks was still around. 
		But it's just us on this ship. Us 
		and your... spirit friends.

				EPPS
		And now you're gonna kill me, is 
		that it?

				MURPHY
		I didn't want it to turn out this 
		way.

				EPPS
		Murphy, don't you see what's 
		happening?

				MURPHY
		I think I see it pretty well.

				EPPS
		It's the ship. The ship's making you 
		think this way.

				MURPHY
		I know a little bit about human nature 
		and what I've seen only confirms 
		that.

				EPPS
		It's a trap. There was no way we 
		were gonna get away with that gold.  
		Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. 
		This ship sucks people in and it 
		never lets them out.

				MURPHY
		I think maybe you been on this boat 
		a little too long, with all that 
		supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's 
		nothing supernatural about greed.  
		And that's what it comes down to, 
		pure and simple.

				EPPS
		I don't give a damn about the gold.

				MURPHY
		I wish I could believe that. Either 
		way, you know what I've done. I've 
		got no choice.

	He raises the shotgun.

				MURPHY
		I'm sorry.

	He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps 
	ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the 
	vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS 
	as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun 
	again.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged 
	rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

				MURPHY
		There's no reason to make this any 
		more difficult than it has to be.

	WITH EPPS

	As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls 
	herself up and climbs inside.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its 
	width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down 
	where several vent ducts lead in different directions below 
	it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

	INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a 
	passageway.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when 
	something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

	FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back 
	into the shadows, holding there.

	The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the 
	other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

	Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at 
	the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch 
	slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN 
	THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving 
	toward it.

	As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, 
	swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

	A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps 
	into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot 
	ricochets off the metal around her.

	She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings 
	down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

	AT THE BOTTOM

	Epps gets up, runs.

	WITH MURPHY

	Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps moves quickly along.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

	INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking 
	on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS 
	IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the 
	ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, 
	as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

	She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it 
	becomes absolutely deafening.

	The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move 
	and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back 
	and forth.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy slows and finally stops.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING 
	GROWS STILL LOUDER.

	Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, 
	when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing 
	out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate 
	of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH 
	WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

	Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through 
	the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a 
	HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious 
	rock promontory of a small island.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off, 
	water pouring in behind it.

	EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a 
	huge gash rising on its port side.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in 
	through the breach.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end 
	of the passage. He begins backing away.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already 
	half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING 
	EXERTION.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo 
	compartment.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris, 
	tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead 
	as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

	Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under 
	the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she 
	was.

	WITH EPPS

	Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and 
	the bulkhead.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.  
	Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in 
	his pockets.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is 
	trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

	ABOVE THE WATER

	The level of the water has now almost completely reached the 
	deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

	INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last 
	ingot and makes his way for the exit.

	INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.  
	She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at 
	the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the 
	murky water.

	Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the 
	water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.  
	They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

	As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.  
	It is Katie.

	She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her 
	hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

	The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she 
	finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the 
	breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

	Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks 
	back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the 
	light of the surface.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

	Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the 
	Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully 
	awash.

	INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

	EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged 
	and the stern beginning to rise.

	Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins 
	swimming toward it.

	INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the 
	top.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

	INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with 
	difficulty.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself 
	up.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top 
	deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under 
	as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft 
	portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps collapses on the rocks.

	EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under 
	momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward 
	smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the 
	current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

	EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

	Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

	EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that 
	pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he 
	is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the 
	smokestack's opening.

	The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of 
	the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, 
	without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke 
	stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing 
	water.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on 
	at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she 
	goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

	She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the 
	Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts 
	and waves her arms.

	EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

	The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time 
	dropping a survival pack.

	The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical 
	now, slipping further and further under.

	Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

	EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

	The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the 
	CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water, 
	then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS, 
	MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface, 
	there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the 
	ocean.

	FADE TO BLACK

ACT ONE
-------
								FADE IN:

EXT. -- A FARMHOUSE OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT

On the farmhouse roof a CHICKEN-SHAPED WEATHERVANE stands silhouetted
against a FULL, BLOOD-RED MOON.  The wind HOWLS and the vane swivels with
an EERIE SQUEAK.  Then a weird ANIMAL CRY is heard--a cross between a
chicken CROWING and a wolf HOWLING.

				WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(A CROWING HOWL)

						CAMERA PANS DOWN TO:

CHICKEN PEN

A fenced-in dirt area with numerous CHICKENS milling around, CLUCKING as
they peck at the ground.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(ANOTHER HOWL, nearer now)
		The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.

WERECHICKEN'S POV -- MOVING

A RED-tinted, shaky, MOVING CAMERA TRUCK-IN on the chickens.  (These shots
are in the style of the POV SHOTS in WOLFEN.)  Magnified GURGLING and
HEAVY BREATHING of Werechicken is heard.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)

The terrified chickens stare INTO CAMERA as the Werechicken moves closer,
his shadow falling over them.  They flap into their coop, SQUAWKING
wildly.

INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

MAUDE and ZEKE sit on the sagging couch watching a werewolf movie on TV
while munching popcorn from a huge bowl.  They're distracted by CHICKENS
SQUAWKING.

				ZEKE
		Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.

				MAUDE
		Jes' set easy, Zeke.
			(she rises; heads for door)
		I'll take a look-see.

Zeke continues staring at TV.

EXT.  FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT -- WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through the Werechicken's red eyes, we see a distant image of Maude with a
flashlight, approaching the fenced-in chicken pen and opening the gate.
CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN toward Maude as she enters, leaving gate open.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(GURGLING, HEAVY BREATHING)

ANGLE WITHIN CHICKEN PEN

The dirt compound is empty now as Maude crosses toward wooden chicken
coop.

				MAUDE
			(as she goes)
		Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.

INT.  CHICKEN COOP -- OTS MAUDE

AS Maude ENTERS from OUT OF CAMERA, her flashlight beam illuminates the
chickens cowering on their roosts in a corner.  They CLUCK nervously.

				MAUDE
		What's got you girls so durned upset?
		There a coyote sneakin' 'round?

Suddenly the Werechicken's shadow moves up Maude's back, then the wall.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(Low, gutteral CLU-UCK)

Maude looks over her shoulder AT CAMERA, reacts.

				MAUDE
			(GASP!)

MAUDE'S POV -- THE WERECHICKEN

Red-eyed, grotesque, three times the size of an ordinary rooster as it
stands framed in the moonlit doorway.  It opens its fanged beak in a
horrifying SHRIEK as it springs AT CAMERA, wings flapping.

				WERECHICKEN
			(Frightening SHRIEK)

INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - CLOSE ON TV

Old black-and-white movie.  MELODRAMATIC MUSIC as a man turns into a
werewolf, his HOWL a continuation of the previous Werechicken SHRIEK.

				TV WEREWOLF
			(eerie HOWL)

WIDER ANGLE - ZEKE

continues watching TV and eating popcorn.  Maude walks stiffly into room
behind him, eyes staring blankly.

				ZEKE
			(without looking up)
		Everythin' okay out there, Maude?

WAIST SHOT -- MAUDE

She stares with glassy, red eyes and CLUCKS quietly.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(CLUCKS)

				ZEKE (VO)
		What say?

PAN DOWN below Maude's waist to reveal that she's turning into a chicken
from the feet up.  First her shoes RIP apart as large, yellow chicken feet
sprout.  Then her dress SWELLS and SPLITS, revealing a large, feathered
body underneath. The only piece of clothing left on her is her apron.  One
foot scratches the floor.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
			(more CLUCKS)

WIDER ANGLE -- FULLSHOT OF MAUDE-CHICKEN

Now completely transformed and six feet tall, she leaps up to perch on
back of couch, THRUSTING her chicken head repeatedly into the popcorn bowl
in Zeke's lap, pecking the bowl clean.  Zeke's jaw hangs open, speechless,
as he stares at the fanged, drooling, six-foot Werechicken.  The
Werechicken looks up from the empty bowl, right in Zeke's terrified eyes.

				ZEKE
			(SCREAMS)

He scrambles backwards off the couch.

EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT - WERECHICKEN'S POV

SCENE RED-tinted.   We hear loud SQUAWKING from within house as chicken
feathers fly out the open windows.

				ZEKE (VO)
			(YELLING)
		Get away!' Scat!  Shoo!

				MAUDE-CHICKEN (VO)
			(loud SQUAWKING)

CLOSE ANGLE -- WERECHICKEN

Watching from slight hilltop.  Its beak seems to bend into an insidious
grin.

				ZEKE (VO)
			(from distance)
		Help!... He-elp!

								CUT TO:

EXT.  ESTABLISHING -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - NIGHT

As CAMERA MOVES IN, we hear:

				PETER (VO)
		Egon, could you hold off on the weather
		balloon bit for a minute?

							DISSOLVE THRU TO:

INT. -- LABORATORY -- ON PETER AND RAY

They stand holding big plastic bags of trash, obviously annoyed at the
O.S. Egon.  Ray's armful of trash is piled so high that he can't see over
it.  SLIMER hovers behind, sticking his nose in one of the bags like a
dog.  He finally dives right into it.

				PETER (CONT)
		It's Your night to take out the trash.

				RAY
		And Winston's in the kitchen doing your
		dishes.

ANGLE ON EGON

He's busy testing his WEATHER BALLOON--a large, pink bubble half the size
of the room.  He moves a lever on its remote control unit and the balloon
rises.

				EGON
			(preoccupied; through above)
		Be with you in ...
			(checks watch)
		...one minute, fifty-three seconds.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Peter and Ray exchange pained glances.  Peter awkwardly attempts to pick
up another trash bag while Ray stumbles around, his vision blocked.  PAN
WITH THEM as they move toward door when Egon's weather balloon suddenly
lowers INTO FRAME.  They bounce into and off of it, which sends the trash
bags flying.

				PETER AND RAY
			(AD-LIB REACTIONS as they
			bounce off balloon)

NEW ANGLE

Peter stumbles backwards and lands butt-first right on one of the bags.
Slimer SQUEALS from within it.

				SLIMER (VO)
			(big muffled SQUEAL)

Then he comes shooting out the back of the bag, the lower half of his body
flat as a Frisbee.

SLIMER

shakes himself off like a dog, spraying slime all over Peter.

				PETER
			(pissed; sarcastic)
		Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!

				SLIMER
		Sorreee!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray helps Peter up as the telephone RINGS and RINGS.

				RAY
			(irritated)
		Egon!  The phone!

ON EGON

The RINGING phone is right beside him on the workbench.

				EGON
			(preoccupied with remote
			controls)
		In a minute, Ray.

ANGLE ON WINSTON

He ENTERS with sleeves rolled up, wiping a plate with a dish towel and
wearing an apron.

				WINSTON
			(sarcastic)
		Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to
		strain yourself.
			(picks up phone)
		Ghostbusters Central.

				VOICE OVER PHONE
			(excited CHATTER)

				WINSTON
		Calm down... Where are you?...
			(a BEAT as he listens)
		We'll be right there.

He hangs up.

WIDER ANGLE

Peter and Ray again have their arms full of trash bags.  Even Slimer is
dragging one.

				WINSTON
		Ready for this one?  Some farmer says his
		wife was eaten by a giant chicken.

				PETER
		Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds
		better than doing Egon's chores.
			(he drops trash bags)
		Let's roll!

Ray and Slimer also abandon their trash bags and EXIT with Peter and
Winston.

REAR VIEW ON EGON

still oblivious as he works in the suddenly empty room.

				EGON
		I think I've finally perfected it.  Watch
		this, guys.
			(a BEAT, he looks around
			over shoulder)
		Guys?

								WIPE TO:

EXT. -- COUNTRY ROAD - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

ECTO-1 roars INTO CAMERA, siren and lights going.

INT. -- ECTO 1 -- MOVING

The Ghostbusters, minus Egon, are wearing their gear.  Slimer hovers in
back seat.

				RAY
		It sure feels strange not having Egon with
		us.

				PETER
			(sarcastic)
		Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's
		not with us.

ON WINSTON

Driving.

				WINSTON
		But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells
		that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be
		a rich man!

ON PETER

Arms folded, grumpily.

				PETER
		Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his
		share of the chores.

EXT. -- ECTO 1 -- NIGHT

As it speeds OUT OF CAMERA toward distant farmhouse, PAN OVER TO the
apron-wearing Maude-Chicken silhouetted in the moonlight, nesting in a
haystack.  MOVE IN TO --

CLOSER ANGLE ON MAUDE-CHICKEN

Her body starts to shake, she ruffles her wings.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(Egg-laying CLUCKS)

Then she suddenly sits up and leaps off the haystack, revealing an
enormous egg beneath her.  Maude SQUAWKS and CLUCKS and struts off into a
cornfield, pecking away at ears of corn.

				MAUDE-CHICKEN
			(SQUAWKS and CLUCKS)

								CUT TO:

INT. -- FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Ray, Winston and Slimer listen seriously as Zeke speaks, but Peter's
obviously not buying it.

				ZEKE
		Had big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest
		dang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet
		tall.

Peter rolls his eyes.

				WINSTON
		Shouldn't be hard to find.

RAY

is jotting info on notepad.

				RAY
		Did it have any distinguishing marks?

ANOTHER ANGLE

				PETER
		Ray!  It's six feet tall!

Peter grabs Ray's arm, starts ushering him to front door.

				PETER (CONT)
			(over shoulder as he goes)
		Thank you, Sir.  We'll put out a missing
		chicken report right away.

EXT.  FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

As the three Ghostbusters and Slimer cross toward Ecto-1 parked in front.

				PETER
			(as they go)
		This one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been
		watchin' too many horror movies and eating
		too much greasy popcorn.

CLOSER ANGLE -- MOVING

				RAY
		No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a
		bonafide werechicken here.

CLOSER ANGLE

Peter and Winston stop, look at Ray in disbelief.

				WINSTON
		A werechicken?

				PETER
		Get serious, Ray.

				RAY
		Then explain those!

Ray points at ground.  Peter, Winston and Slimer look down.

THEIR POV

Peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints.

							SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. -- OPEN FIELD -- NIGHT

The three Ghostbusters follow Maude's "chicken" tracks with powerful
flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks.  Slimer moves ahead,
nose to ground like a bloodhound.

				SLIMER
			(SNIFFS as he goes)

ANGLE ON SLIMER

He floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him
right into the haystack.  We hear a BONK from within, then:

				SLIMER (VO)
		Ow!

Slimer backs OUT INTO SHOT rubbing his head.  He looks up and his eyes pop
wide.

				SLIMER
			(amazed GASP!)

LOW ANGLE ON GIANT EGG

The Ghostbusters ENTER SHOT and play their flashlights across the huge egg
sitting atop the haystack.

				RAY
			(excited)
		What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken
		egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!

WIDER ANGLE

As Ray and Winston ease the egg down off the haystack.  Peter holds his
PKE meter up to it.

				PETER
		Look, if this is a werechicken egg,

CLOSER ANGLE -- METER

Nothing registers on the meter.

				PETER (CONT)
		...how come there's no PKE reading?

THREESHOT

Ray and Winston still hold giant egg.

				RAY
			(looking at meter in
			Peter's hand)
		I dunno... that is strange.

				WINSTON
		Let's get it back to Headquarters and run
		some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some
		answers.

ON RAY

				RAY
		Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken
		that laid this has gotta be around here
		someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.

ON PETER AND SLIMER

				PETER
			(throws up his hands with
			heavy SIGH)
		I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer.

They take egg from Ray and Winston and start back toward Ecto-l.

				PETER  (CONT)
			(shaking his head; as he
			goes)
		Werechickens.

WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through its RED EYES we see, from a distance, Peter and Slimer carrying
the egg, Ray and Winston moving off in other direction.

				WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(BREATHING & SLOBBERING)

							SMASH CUT TO:

INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - LAB - NIGHT

Egon still busy with his balloon as Peter and Slimer carry egg in through
door.

				PETER
			(through above)
		Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work
		for you:  How about analyzing this?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Egon looks around, reacts to egg.

				EGON
		Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg
		I've ever seen.

Peter and Slimer set egg on Egon's desk.

				PETER
		I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've
		had a long night in a not-too-fragrant
		barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting
		the sheets.

Peter EXITS as Slimer ZIPS in close beside Egon, elbows on desk, chin in
hands, eyeing Egon and egg expectantly.  Egon pushes glasses up off tip of
nose and blinks at egg, not sure what to do with it.  CAMERA MOVES IN on
egg and we --

							MATCH-DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. -- FULL MOON IN COUNTRY SKY -- NIGHT

CAMERA PANS DOWN from full moon to reveal the tiny figures of Ray and
Winston approaching an old barn.  They stop, shining their flashlights on
closed main door.

				WINSTON
			(tired)
		Ray, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there
		really isn't any...

				RAY
			(holds up one hand)
		Shh!

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray extends his PKE meter toward barn.  It BEEPS incessantly.

				RAY
			(low voice)
		It's in there.

				WINSTON
			(unclipping his blaster)
		Then let's get it!

INT. BARN -- HIGH ANGLE ON MAIN DOOR -- WERECHICKEN'S POV

Through its RED EYES we see the barn door slowly CREAK open, revealing Ray
and Winston peering in.

CLOSER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON

They ENTER cautiously, Ray holding his BEEPING meter out before him.  The
barn is dark except for the moonlight slanting through the loft window and
the beams of their flashlights.  As the WIND picks up, WOOD CREAKS, HAY
RUSTLES, and a piece of JUNKY machinery turns with a SQUEAL.

				WINSTON
			(WHISPER)
		Man, this place is creepy.

				RAY
			(WHISPER)
		It's in here -- I can feel it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Suddenly the door SLAMS shut behind them and the FLAP OF BEATING WINGS
SCURRIES through the darkness.  Winston JUMPS.

				WINSTON
		Look out!

Ray shines his flashlight toward the lofts.  Its beam catches a couple of
startled pigeons as they fly out the window, pinion feathers WHISTLING.

REACTION SHOT -- RAY AND WINSTON

				RAY & WINSTON
			(relieved SIGHS)

WERECHICKEN'S POV

RED-TINTED, moving slowly toward Ray and Winston from behind.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HEAVY BREATHING)

CLOSE ON RAY AND WINSTON

They stop as PKE meter starts BEEPING.  Ray checks the reading.

				RAY
			(whisper)
		Something's close.  Very close.

WERECHICKEN'S POV

Closing on Ray and Winston.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HEAVY BREATHING)

The guys wheel around.

THEIR POV ON WERECHICKEN

We see only its face.  The blood-red eyes stare menacingly, its fanged
beak slightly open and drooling.

				WERECHICKEN
			(HEAVY RASPY BREATHING)

ZOOM BACK TO --

WIDER ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It hops forward into a streak of moonlight.  It's three feet tall, its
wings hang out at the sides, and its evil, blood-red eyes stare at CAMERA.

				WERECHICKEN  (CONT)
			(HEAVY PANTING)

				RAY (VO)
		It is a werechicken!

ANGLE ON RAY and WINSTON

Backing away, blasters leveled.

				WINSTON
		Man, he is ugly!

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It postures, rooster-like and:

				WERECHICKEN
			(ROARS angrily)

ON RAY and WINSTON

Still backing up.

				RAY
		Bad choice of words, Winston.

THE WERECHICKEN suddenly leaps AT CAMERA.

				WERECHICKEN
			(loud SHRIEKING SQUAWK)

WERECHICKEN'S POV

ZOOM-IN on Winston and Ray.  They open fire.

FULL SHOT

The proton streams catch the Werechicken in mid-air as it vaults toward
Ray and Winston, halting its leap and suspending it in a corona of proton
energy.

				WERECHICKEN
			(SHRIEKS)

A HIDEOUS SPIRIT rises from its writhing body -- shapeless, but with
monstrous glowing eyes and fangs.  The spirit lets out a ROAR more
frightening than the Werechicken howl.

				SPIRIT
			(big ROAR)

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray, still firing his gun, snaps a trap loose from his belt, and tosses it
onto the barn floor.  It POPS open.

				RAY
		Trap out!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray and Winston, struggling with the writhing Spirit caught in the
streams, guide the Spirit into the trap.

				WINSTON
		Hang on!  That's it!

				RAY
		We've almost got him!

CLOSE ON TRAP

The Spirit is sucked into the trap, which SLAMS shut.

WIDER ANGLE -- RAY AND WINSTON

A normal chicken with singed feathers stands where the Werechicken was.
It CLUCKS, starts pecking at the dirt.

				CHICKEN
			(Normal CLUCKING)

				RAY
			(looking at chicken)
		Well, that takes care of one werechicken.

CLOSER ON THE GUYS

Ray picks up the smoking trap.

				RAY (CONT)
		Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's
		wife.

They head for the door.  Winston stops.

				WINSTON
		Ray, I just had a thought...

Ray pauses to look around at Winston.

				WINSTON (CONT)
		What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's
		wife?

And off their looks, we --

								CUT TO:

INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ -KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Egon carries the big egg into kitchen, Slimer helping.

				EGON
			(straining)
		Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't
		have time to examine this egg tonight.  I
		have to prepare for my weather balloon
		demonstration tomorrow morning.

ANOTHER ANGLE

With his elbow, Egon opens refrigerator with and the two of them place the
giant egg inside.

				EGON (CONT)
			(through above)
		But it'll be safe in here.

				SLIMER
		Yeah.

Egon closes fridge.

				SLIMER
			(big YAWN)
		G'night, Egon.

Slimer floats off.

				EGON
		Goodnight, Slimer.

								WIPE TO:

INT. -- BEDROOM

Slimer is SNORING, hovering above Peter's empty bed.

				SLIMER
			(SNORING)

CLOSE ON SLIMER

In a BUBBLE above him, we see Slimer's DREAM, various kinds of food
dancing and SINGING the first two bars of Los Lobos' "LA BAMBA" a la the
California Raisins in "I Heard It Through The Grapevine."  Still asleep,
Slimer licks his lips hungrily, opens his mouth incredibly wide and
pounces on the entire dream balloon with a teeth-jarring CHOMP! that POPS
the dream bubble so that it EXPLODES inside his mouth, waking him up.
Slimer sits up with a wide-eyed, hungry look, rubbing his tummy.

				SLIMER
		Fooooood.

He zips o.s.

INT. -- KITCHEN

Dark.  Lights go on, then Slimer SKIDS to mid-air stop and whips open
fridge.  His eyes pop as he sees the egg.

				SLIMER
			(licking his lips)
		Yummy!

Slimer rolls egg toward edge of shelf, then the full weight of the egg
drives Slimer straight to the floor.  The egg bounces on his stomach twice
before he gets a grip on it.  Straining his little green brains out, he
floats the egg up into the air and o.s.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS, then GRUNTS)

ANGLE ON OVEN

Slimer shoves egg in the open oven, closes door, turns on the heat, then
moves O.S.  The oven interior glows red and the egg starts to quiver.

ON SLIMER

Slimer HUMS as he busily sets table for one:  placemat, a plate, utensils,
salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish, ... a flurry of activity
that all focuses on his personal eating spot.

				SLIMER
			(HUMMING through above)

ANGLE ON OVEN

Through window we see the egg shake and then begin to crack open.

RESUME ON SLIMER

Hovering at table, still preparing for feast.  He puts on a bib, unaware
of oven shaking behind him.

				SLIMER
			(still HUMMING)

With a loud BANG, the oven practically explodes and the door flies off.
Out pops a BABY WERECHICKEN, SNARLING and CACKLING.

				BABY WERECHICKEN
			(SNARLING, CACKLING)

ON SLIMER

His eyes bug and his paw drops.

				SLIMER
			(startled SCREAM)

Slimer barrels up through sink faucet, leaving his bib stuck in the
opening.

INT. -- SHOWER

Peter shampooing his hair.

				PETER
			(AD LIB SINGING)

Slimer comes shooting out through shower nozzle, hugs Peter tightly around
the neck and scaring the hell out of him.

				PETER
			(startled YELL; then:)
		Slimer!  How 'bout some privacy??

				SLIMER
			(pointing, eyes wide)
		Monster!  Inna kitchen!

				PETER
		Monster?

				SLIMER
			(nods)
		Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!
			(imitates werechicken)
			(SNARLING & CACKLING)

INT. -- LAB

Egon works at his table.  A now familiar Werechicken shadow appears over
his shoulder and grows up the wall.

CLOSER ANGLE - REAR VIEW ON EGON

Werechicken creeps OUT OF CAMERA, bites Egon on the rear and pulls back
o.s., chicken claws CLATTERING off into distance.

				EGON
			(looking around)
		Ow!

				BABY WERECHICKEN  (VO)
			(CACKLING fading into
			distance)

ON EGON

Dazed, he looks down at his feet.

CLOSE ON EGON'S SHOES

Chicken toes pop through the leather, one at a time.

				EGON (VO)
			(dazed)
		What?

CLOSE SHOTS

As Egon's transformation continues:  His coveralls RIP apart at the legs,
then midriff, then his arms turn into wings.  Finally, a beak sprouts from
his face.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(Weird CLUCK)

							SMASH CUT TO:

INT. HALL OUTSIDE LAB -- NIGHT

Peter (now dressed and wearing his backpack) runs up to lab door and
flings it open, Slimer right behind him.

INT. LAB

Peter and Slimer look in, not seeing Egon, who is now a six-foot-tall
werechicken, but still wearing his glasses, standing behind door.

				PETER
			(CALLS)
		Egon?
			(to Slimer)
		Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here
		that looks like a monster.

The Egon-Chicken jumps out right in front of Peter and Slimer.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(CHICKEN HOWL)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Slimer freaks and rockets right through the nearest wall.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS as he goes)

				PETER
		Holy cow!!

Peter raises his proton gun.

CLOSE ON EGON-CHICKEN

He flaps his wings wildly, his red eyes bulging, and GROWLS, revealing
impressive fangs.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(LOUD GROWL)

				END ACT ONE
				-----------

ACT TWO
-------
INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS LAB -- NIGHT

Egon the Werechicken moves toward Peter, fangs bared in attack mode.

				EGON-CHICKEN
			(SNARLING as he goes)

ON PETER

He steps back into doorway, blaster leveled at Egon-Chicken, and SNAPS on
the power.  It HUMS to life.

				PETER
			(horrified)
		What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!

				RAY (VO)
		Peter!  Wait!

A hand grabs Peter by the arm fust as the thrower fires, sending the
proton stream off at an angle into ceiling, barely missing the chicken.

				PETER
			(surprised as he looks
			around)
		Hey!

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LAB

as Ray pulls Peter out into corridor, Winston kicks door shut in the
Egon-Chicken's snarling face and quickly locks it.  Slimer hovers nearby
looking worried.

				EGON-CHICKEN (VO)
			(SNARLS)

CLOSE ANGLE

The door SHAKES and SHUDDERS as the unseen Egon-Chicken tries to break
through.

				PETER
			(irritated; through above)
		What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate
		Egon!

				RAY
		Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he
		was bitten and now he's a werechicken!

The door behind them is starting to splinter and bulge from the battering
of the Egon-Chicken.

				PETER
			(looking at door)
		You're kidding!
			(a BEAT, then)
		Come to think of it, there was a certain
		resemblance.

Suddenly the battering stops.

				WINSTON
			(looking toward door)
		What happened?  He's so quiet all of a
		sudden.

ON RAY

Looking toward o.s. window, he reacts.

				RAY
		It's the moon!

He hurries o.s.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray stops at window, looks out.  Beyond we see the full moon.  Peter,
Winston and Slimer come up behind him.

				RAY (CONT)
		Tonight's the first --

CLOSE ON MOON

It's beginning to disappear, right to left.

				RAY (VO)(CONT)
		-- lunar eclipse in ten years!

ON GHOSTBUSTERS AND SLIMER

All looking out window as eclipse continues

				PETER
		Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being
		a chicken?

				RAY
			(turning to others)
		Werechickens only appear during a full
		moon, and for the next few minutes, the
		moon's not full.

INT. LAB -- ON DOOR

Door opens and Ray pecks in.

				RAY
			(tentative)
		Egon?

ANGLE ON EGON

Seen from the waist up (he's not wearing clothes), looking around,
confused.  He sees Ray.

				EGON
		Ray, what is going on?

WIDER ANGLE

Egon is holding his tattered coveralls in front of his waist, like a
skirt.

				EGON (CONT)
		And why am I naked?

Suddenly Slimer flies INTO SHOT and gives Egon a big, sloppy kiss.

				SLIMER
			(as he enters)
		Egon!
			(KISSING SOUNDS)

ON PETER AND WINSTON

				PETER
		Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and
		some bad news.

				EGON
			(as he sits)
		Bad news first.

				WINSTON
		You've been turned into a werechicken!

ON EGON

His glasses slip to the end of his nose as his eyes widen.  He pushes them
back up.

				EGON
		A werechicken?

ON RAY

He hurriedly thumbs through the TOBIN SPIRIT GUIDE.

				RAY
			(flipping through book)
		Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens!
			(reads)
		"The werechicken appears during the full
		moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into
		another werechicken."
			(he looks at Egon)
		That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...

ON EGON

He rubs his rear.

				EGON
			(through above)
		I remember the bite clearly.  How long will
		I stay like this?

ON RAY, WINSTON and PETER

Looking at the Tobin Guide.

				RAY
			(looking in Tobin's Guide)
		According to this, there is an antidote.
		But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse
		only lasts three minutes!

INT. FIREHOUSE KITCHEN

Slimer scrambles through the cupboard, grabbing various bottles of stuff,
and hands them to Winston who adds ingredients to mixing bowl and stirs
while Ray reads from Tobin's Guide.

				RAY
			(reading through above)
		"One tablespoon paprika, one clove of
		garlic, some parsley for color, cup of
		gelatin..."

ANGLE ON WINDOW

Through it we see the eclipsed moon starting to emerge from shadow.

INT. LAB -- ANGLE ON EGON

His pupils look constricted and he's perspiring.

				EGON
			(weakly)
		I don't feel well.

Peter steps INTO SHOT, puts arm around Egon's shoulders.

				PETER
			(through above)
		Take it easy, Egon.  You're gonna be fine.
			(SHOUTS O.S.; worried)
		Hurry it up, guys!

INT.  KITCHEN -- ON WINSTON AND RAY

				RAY
			(reading hurriedly)
		"And one tablespoon of chickenbane."

ON SLIMER

He rummages through shelves, then looks down at Ray.

				SLIMER
			(aghast)
		No chickenbane!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ray and winston exchange panicky looks.

				RAY
		Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!

They run OUT with the mixing bowl of liquid.  Slimer follows.

INT. LAB -- CLOSE ON EGON'S LEGS

They're once again turning into chicken legs and chicken feet.  Toes
popping out like popcorn.

				PETER (VO)
			(YELLS)
		Come on, Ray!!

WIDER ANGLE

As Peter and Egon stare down at the chicken legs and chicken feet.

				PETER  (CONT)
			(YELLS o.s.)
		He's changing again!

Ray, Slimer and Winston rush INTO SHOT.

				RAY
			(breathless)
		Quick, Egon, drink this!

Winston hands the bowl of potion to Egon, who gulps it down.

				EGON
			(swallowing, GULPING
			sounds)

As Egon drinks, his arms transform into wings and he drops the bowl,
breaking it.

				WINSTON
		We're too late!

CLOSER -- EGON

As the transformation  and feathers  rise up  his shoulders.  Suddenly,
the transformation  stops at  the neck.   DRAMATIC MUSIC STOPS, too.

ON PETER, RAY, WINSTON AND SLIMER

They stare, wide-eyed.  After A BEAT --

				PETER
		What happened?

WIDER ANGLE

To include Egon, who is once again a six-foot-tall chicken, but with
Egon's own neck and head.

				RAY
		The potion only partly worked, because of
		the missing chickenbane.

				PETER
		Well, we hafta do something!

				EGON
		Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter.
		There's a logical solution to every problem.

				BABY WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWL)

CLOSER ANGLE

Strands of slime stand straight up on the nape of Slimer's "neck" at the
sound -- like a frightened cat -- and he dives into a test tube in a rack
on Egon's workbench.

				SLIMER
			(SQUEALS as he goes)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

looking around.

				WINSTON
		What was that?

				RAY
		The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still
		out there somewhere.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				PETER
			(to others)
		Let's stop that thing before it makes
		drumsticks out of anyone else!
			(to Egon)
		Un, no offense, Egon.

The three normal Ghostbusters dash toward door.

							SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. -- AERIAL VIEW -- MANHATTAN -- NIGHT

ECTO-2 glides over the city, running lights blinking.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter at the controls.  Slimer sits beside him, looking down at the city
through binoculars.

				PETER
			(into radio mike)
		All quiet on the chicken front.  How about
		down there?

INT. -- ECTO-1 -- MOVING

Winston driving.  Ray on the radio.

				RAY
		Not a peep.

				WINSTON
			(gives Ray a dirty look)
		No pun intended.

EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Several people run out front door SCREAMING as ECTO-1 passes.

				PEOPLE
			(SCREAMING as they exit)

INT. -- ECTO-1 - MOVING

Winston and Ray look back at exiting people.

				WINSTON
		That's it!

Winston cranks the wheel.

EXT.  ECTO-1

As it makes a SCREECHING U-turn.

EXT. -- SUPERMARKET

Ecto-1 SKIDS up, doors open, and Ray and Winston leap out, blasters at the
ready, running toward store entrance.

INT. -- SUPERMARKET

Ray and winston run in and stop inside door beside a panicked BOX BOY who
points o.s.

				BOX BOY
			(breathless)
		It's in there!  A big chicken!  It's gotta
		be ten feet tall!

CLOSER ANGLE

Ray and Winston exchange glances.

				WINSTON
		Ten feet tall?

				BOX BOY
			(nods)
		Maybe fifteen, I dunno.  Big!
			(he runs o.s.)
		I'm outta here!

				RAY
			(to Winston)
		Let's split up.

They run off in opposite directions, flanking the long aisles.

ON RAY

PAN WITH him as he cautiously moves along, aisle by aisle.  At far end of
aisles, Winston can be seen doing the same.  The market is thrashed,
spilled groceries everywhere.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As they reach the last aisle.  No chicken.  Ray joins Winston.

				WINSTON
		How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall
		chicken?

				BUTCHER (VO)
			(frightened SCREAM)

				RAY
		We didn't!  Come on!

They hurry o.s.

INT. MEAT DEPT. -- ON BUTCHER

He's hiding under his butcher block, trembling.  Ray and Winston run INTO
SHOT.  The Butcher looks up, eyes wide.

				BUTCHER
		A giant chicken just came through here --
		it was thirty feet tall!

CLOSER ANGLE

				WINSTON
		Thirty feet tall?

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Butcher is pointing out open door.  Beyond is a parking lot with a
trail of crushed cars right down the middle.

				BUTCHER (CONT)
		Yeah!  Look what it did to those cars!

Ray and Winston race out the door.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - WIDE ON ECTO-2 FLYING -- NIGHT

The little chopper, lights blinking, skims low past three-and four-story
buildings.

				PETER (VO)
			(into radio)
		It's how big?  Okay, Ray, I admit you were
		right about these Werechickens,...

INT.  ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter and Slimer, as before.

				PETER (CONT)
		...but I definitely don't buy them growing
		to the size of buildings.

				SLIMER
		(covers mouth, LAUGHTER FIZZING
		through his closed, flapping lips.
		"How absurd.")

Suddenly, the head of the Werechicken rears up INTO SHOT right in front of
Ray and Slimer.

				SLIMER
			(SCREAMS)

				WERECHICKEN
			(deafening HOWL)

ECTO-2 is buffeted about by the howl as Peter jams the stick forward.

WIDER ON ECTO-2

It makes a steep, banking dive and gets the hell out of there, barely
escaping the big Werechicken's beak that SNAPS shut on thin air just
behind Ecto-2's retreating tail.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter is shaken, but in control.  Slimer is trembling like green Jell-O.

				PETER
			(into mike)
		Ray, you were right!  The chicken's here,
		and he's a walking high-rise!

INT. -- ECTO-1 -- NIGHT -- MOVING

				RAY
			(into radio)
		On our way, Peter.

Winston floors it and he and Ray accelerate forward INTO CAMERA.

INT. BUNKROOM -- GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - MORNING

Egon is "perched" on the window sill, looking pensively out at the city,
still a chicken from the neck down.  A BEAT, then:

				JANINE (VO)
			(big SCREAM)

				EGON
			(startled CLUCK)

Startled, Egon flutters up off the sill, gravity takes over, and he lands
on his feathered butt.

WIDER ANGLE

Revealing Janine standing frozen in the doorway, eyes wide with disbelief,
hands to her cheeks.

				JANINE
		Egon!  What happened?

				EGON
		It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my
		coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board
		in forty-five...
			(CLUCK)
		...minutes.

ON JANINE

She stares at Egon, totally bewildered.

				JANINE
		But what ...?
			(thinks better of asking)
		Nevermind.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Janine takes a long yellow raincoat off a door hook and helps him into it.
He's completely covered except for his head and feet.

				JANINE
		Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like
		-- this?

				EGON
		Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least.

ANGLE ON EGON

As he struts toward the door, we see his tail protruding through a slit in
the back of coat.  He EXITS, CLUCKING.

				EGON
			(CLUCKING as he goes)

CLOSE JANINE

Staring after him in disbelief.

EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN -- ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

It walks along stepping on cars, kicking over telephone poles, etc., a la
Godzilla.  The streets SHAKE.  Panicky pedestrians flee the Werechicken's
giant feet.

				CROWD
			(panicky WALLA)

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Peter and Slimer are following giant chicken.

				PETER
			(into radio)
		It's heading down 34th toward the Empire
		State Building.

EXT. -- THE STREETS -- DAWN

Ecto-1 SPEEDS around a corner, SIREN blaring.

				RAY (VO)
		Check!  We're almost there.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BLDG. -- DAWN

Sun rises behind the werechicken as it approaches in distance.  With each
HOWL, the streets SHAKE.

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWLS)

LOW ANGLE ON ECTO-1

Approaching CAMERA fast, it SCREECHES to a halt.  Doors fly open.  Ray and
Winston LEAP out, open fire, their proton streams angling upward.

LOW ANGLE POV - WERECHICKEN

Moving toward them down the concrete canyon, flattening street lamps and
power poles.  Ecto-2 can be seen flying above and behind it.  The proton
streams are up toward it.

INT. ECTO-2

				PETER
		Take over, Slimer!

				SLIMER
		Roger!

Slimer grabs the control stick in both hands as Peter leans out to one
side with his blaster and fires downward.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

Caught in the three crossing streams.  It FLAILS about, knocking over
street lights and bashing in the sides of buildings, and lets out a
deafening HOWL.  A MONSTROUS SPIRIT emerges from its body and fills the
screen like a transparent film.

				WERECHICKEN
			(enraged HOWLS)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

Ray tosses out the trap.

				RAY
		Let's reel him in!

WIDER ANGLE

As Ray, Winston and Peter's beams draw the Spirit toward the trap.

				SPIRIT
			(angry HOWLS)

CLOSER ON TRAP

Ray's boot stomps on trigger and trap springs open.  As the Spirit comes
into contact with the trap a small STORM ERUPTS around it.  SPARKS and
LIGHTNING BOLTS fly.  A HURRICANE-like WIND BLOWS.

ON RAY AND WINSTON

Being buffeted by wind, struggling to hang onto their throwers as they
continue firing.  They have to SHOUT over the NOISE.

				WINSTON
			(loud)
		Trap's full!  Somebody forgot to empty it!

ON ECTO-2

The wind is really bouncing it around.  Slimer has his hands full, while
Peter continues shooting.

				RAY
			(YELLS)
		Whose job was it?

RAY AND WINSTON

turn to each other.

				RAY AND WINSTON
		EGON'S!

CLOSE ON TRAP

Light FLASHES rapidly.  Trap begins to shake and glow.

				RAY (VO)
		It's gonna blow!

LOW ANGLE -- ECTO-2

				WINSTON (VO)
			(over walkie-talkie)
		Peter, get outa here!

It banks, gets the hell away.

RAY AND WINSTON

turn off their proton guns and are KNOCKED down by the released force as
the freed Monstrous Spirit whooshes skyward.  The STORM abruptly
disappears, as if SUCKED up.  The trap stops shaking and SNAPS shut.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

As the Spirit POPS back into its body, JARRING it.  Its chicken face
contorts with new ANGER.

				WERECHICKEN
			(HOWLS)

WIDER ANGLE

It turns and starts up the side of the Empire State Building.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MORNING

The werechicken is halfway to the top.  PULL BACK to reveal Peter, Slimer,
Winston and Ray standing in street looking up at him.  Ecto-1 and 2 are
behind them.

				PETER
		So how're we gonna, put that big bird on
		ice, guys'

				RAY
			(SNAPS finger)
		Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken
		freezes at very low temperatures!

CLOSER ANGLE

				WINSTON
		Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot
		chicken in August?

A BEAT, then the three guys look at each other.

				RAY, WINSTON & PETER
		Egon's weather balloon!

EXT. -- BUILDING ROOFTOP -- MORNING

Not far from the Empire State Building.  Egon stands before a group of
seated MEN and WOMEN --THE WEATHER BOARD -- in his rain coat.  To one
side, the weather balloon hovers above them.

				EGON
		Distinguished members of the Weather Board,
		my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu-
		capability --

ANGLE ON EGON

The top of the Empire State Building is visible behind him as he holds the
small weather device control box in one winged hand.

				EGON (CONT)
		... of entering the upper atmosphere where
		clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.

ANGLE ON BOARD MEMBERS

They look at each other, puzzled.

				BOARD
			(puzzled MUTTERING WALLA)

RESUME ON EGON

				EGON (VO)(CONT)
		There, it can electronically alter weather
		cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun,
		rain, or...
			(BAWK!)
		...snow.

Ecto-2 ascends into view behind him and hovers, the chopper's rotors
blowing Egon's raincoat up over his head, exposing the chicken body
underneath.

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Their mouths drop open as they stare at Egon's chicken body.

				BOARD MEMBERS
			(excited WALLA)

ANGLE ON EGON

He pulls raincoat down off his face, holding it in place with one hand as
he looks at audience with forced smile.

				EGON
			(to Board members)
		I, er, can explain this, but --

Slimer flies INTO SHOT beside Egon and WHISPERS in his ear.

				SLIMER
			(WHISPERING MUTTERS)

				EGON
		What?

He looks around to where Slimer is pointing.

EGON'S POV

As the Werechicken climbs into view, scaling the upper stories of the
Empire State Building.

				WERECHICKEN
			(distant SQUAWKS)

NEW ANGLE

The Weather Board members see the Werechicken and start to SCREAM.

				WEATHER BOARD MEMBERS
			(SCREAMING)

ON EGON

He JUMPS onto a rope ladder hanging from Ecto-2 and climbs inside.  Slimer
flies in right behind him and Ecto-2 rises up OUT OF SHOT.

INT. -- ECTO-2 -- MOVING

Egon settles into passenger seat.  Slimer hovers behind them.

				PETER
			(loud over engine)
		Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with
		your weather balloons

				EGON
			(holds up wings)
		Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.

				PETER
			(nods)
		Piece of cake.

EXT. -- ECTO-2 -- MORNING

It banks off toward the Empire State Building as the Werechicken reaches
the top of the spire.

ON WERECHICKEN

As it gets "comfortable" on the spire, fluffing its feathers.  It begins
to quiver (like Maude did earlier when she laid an egg).

				WERECHICKEN
			(hideous CROW)

ON RAY AND WINSTON

On street below, looking skyward through binoculars.

				WINSTON
		What's it doing?

				RAY
		It looks like it's about to lay an --

Winston puts a hand over Ray's mouth.

				WINSTON
			(with dread)
		I don't want to hear it.

ANGLE ON WEATHER BALLOON

It rises from weather bureau rooftop, then drifts along horizontally, away
from the Empire State Building.  It stops, then begins to rise again.  The
sky darkens as the balloon rises into the clouds.

INT. ECTO-2 - MOVING

Peter, Egon, Slimer, as before.  Peter operates the weather balloon
control box while Slimer flies the chopper.

				EGON
		Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position.
		Turn the lever to the extreme left.

CLOSE UP ON WEATHER CONTROL BOX

Peter turns a lever.

ANGLE ON BALLOON

The balloon and surrounding clouds start to freeze, turning white and
forming ice on them.  Suddenly, snow starts to fall.

ON SLIMER

He sticks his tongue out and catches some snowflakes.

ANGLE ON WERECHICKEN

Blizzard-like snow pelts it.  The chicken begins to stiffen and turn white
with frost.

				WERECHICKEN
			(angry SQUAWKS)

ANGLE ON STREETS

Snow falls on Ray and Winston as they gaze skyward.

				RAY AND WINSTON
		They did it!  All-right!!

They high-five each other.

								WIPE TO:

EXT. FIREHOUSE -- NIGHT

A heavy snow continues to fall as CAMERA MOVES IN

				MAUDE (VO)
			(calls)
		Anyone for dessert?

INT, FIREHOUSE - DINING AREA

Maude (back to normal) emerges from kitchen carrying a large, steaming
bowl.  Seated around the table are Egon (back to normal) Peter, Winston,
Ray and Zeke.  No Slimer.  There are half-empty soup bowls in front of
everyone and the diners all look full to the point of weariness -- except
Slimer.

				EGON
			(raising hand)
		You bet, Maude.

ON PETER

As he looks at bowl of soup Maude sets down.

				PETER
		Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!

ON EGON

spooning soup eagerly into his bowl.

				EGON
		I'm actually starting to like it.

ON MAUDE

				MAUDE
		No more werechicken problems for us,
		eh, Egon?
			(CHUCKLES)

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(HOWL)

WIDER ANGLE

Everyone freezes and looks o.s.

				WINSTON
		Uh-oh.

				RAY
		It came from the lab!

The Ghostbusters burst from their chairs and run o.s.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LAB

As the Ghostbusters cautiously advance, blasters ready.

INT. LAB -- ON DOOR

It opens and the Ghostbusters peer in.  Suddenly ...

				WERECHICKEN (VO)
			(another HOWL)

SWISH PAN to ...

A HUGE SHADOW on the lab wall, its head making a "pecking" motion like a
werechicken.  After a beat, PAN DOWN to reveal Slimer with a Walkman on
his head, "pecking" his head to the rhythm of his music.  Slimer HOWLS
again ...

				SLIMER
			(HOWLS)

ON GHOSTBUSTERS

				WINSTON
			(big SIGH)
		It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James
		Brown tape.

ON SLIMER

As he continues to groove to the music.

				SLIMER
			(a la James Brown)
		I feel good!
		I knew that I would
		So good, so good, so good!
			(big James Brown HOWL as
			we --)

ON GHOSTBUSTERS

Peter turns to the others in disgust.

				PETER

		Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken
		outfit?

EXT.  MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY

A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty
prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DAY

A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full
bags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The

building superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to
notice.

						DANA
				 (exasperated)
			Frank, do you think you could give me a hand
			with these bags?

						FRANK
			I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a
			building superintendent.

						DANA
			You're also a human being, Frank.

						FRANK
				 (reluctantly going to help)
			Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the
			hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the
			grocery bags from her.

						DANA
				 (setting the wheel brakes on
				 the buggy)
			Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this
			eventually.

She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and
makes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.

						FRANK
				 (to the baby)
			Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?

						FRANK
				 (to Dana)
			That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.
			Barrett.

						DANA
				 (finding her keys)
			Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to
			fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you
			last week.

						FRANK
			Didn't I do it?

BABY BUGGY

It starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

He GURGLES with delight at the movement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY

Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage.

						DANA
			No, you didn't, Frank.

						FRANK
			Okay, that's no problem.

						DANA
			That's exactly what you said last week.

BUGGY WHEELS

The brakes unlock themselves.

DANA

She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward
just out of her reach and stops.  Surprised by the movement, she reaches
for the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even
further.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed.

SIDEWALK

Dana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians
for help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked.

INTERSECTION

Cars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner.

DANA

She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.

BUGGY

It careens toward the corner.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

Its eyes are wide open with excitement.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk.

BUS

The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the
intersection at high speed.

BUGGY

It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street.  The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches.

INTERSECTION

Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby.  She hugs it close, deeply
relieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY

THEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar "No Ghosts" symbol
and PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the
Ghostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the
Upper West Side.  RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding
shotgun.

EXT.  WEST 77TH STREET - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)

The Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.
Stantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump
out of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the
house.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

A WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished
house.

						STANTZ
				 (all business)
			How many of them are there, ma'am?

She holds her hand out indicating about four feet.

						WINSTON
				 (resolute)
			We'll do our best, ma'am.

						WOMAN
			They're right out here.

She leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.
Stantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.

						STANTZ
			Ready?

						WINSTON
			I'm ready.

						STANTZ
			Then let's do it.

He pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.

INT.  BROWNSTONE - DAY  (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS
between the ages of seven and ten.

						KIDS
				 (disappointed)
			Ghostbusters!!  Boooo!!

Tables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the
room is strewn with discarded toys and games.  A couple of weary parents
sink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.

						WINSTON
				 (trying his best)
			How you doin', kids?

						LITTLE BOY
				 (nasty)
			I though we were having He-Man.

						STANTZ
			He-Man couldn't make it today.  That's why

						BOY
			My dad says you're full of crap.

						STANTZ
				 (stopped cold)
			Well, a lot of people have trouble believing
			in the paranormal.

						BOY
			No, he just says you're full of crap and that's
			why you went out of business.

He kicks Stantz in the leg.  Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.

						STANTZ
				 (low and menacing)
			I'm watching you.
				 (to Winston)
			Song.

Winston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the
Ghostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing

			'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.
			Who you gonna call?'

			That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties.
			I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged
			nine-year-olds.

They get in the car

INT.  ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.

						WINSTON
			Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past.
			Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year
			these kids won't even remember who we are.

						STANTZ
				 (tries to start the car again)
			Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we
			did for this city.

						WINSTON
			Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job
			we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow
			man and blew the top three floors off an uptown
			highrise.

						STANTZ
			Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a
			hamburger without chopping up a cow.

He turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and
CLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits
of metal onto the pavement.  Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies.  Frustrated, Stantz
bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

INT.  WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)

A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,
Channel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and
we return to the show in progress: "World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter
Venkman."  There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster.

VENKMAN

He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,
understated and intimate.

						VENKMAN
			Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'
			I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,
			author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton
			Anglund.
				 (to his guest)
			Milt, your new book is called The End of the
			World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about
			gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you
			think anybody wants to read a book about it?

						MILTON
			Well, I think it's important for people to know
			that the world is in danger.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to
			happen or do we have to buy the book?

						MILTON
			I predict that the world will end at the
			stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
			This year?  That's cutting it a little close,
			isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of
			view, the book just came out, right?  So you're
			not even looking at the paperback release for
			maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least
			another year after that if the thing has
			movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.
			You would have been better off predicting 1992
			or even '94 just to be safe.

						MILTON
				 (irritated)
			This is not just some money-making scheme!  I
			didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong
			psychic belief that the world will end on New
			Year's Eve.

						VENKMAN
				 (placating)
			Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But
			I think my other guest may disagree with you.
			Elaine, you had another date in mind?

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey
housewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.

						ELAINE
			According to my sources, the world will end
			on February 14, in the year 2016.

						VENKMAN
			Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer.
			Where did you get that date, Elaine?

						ELAINE
			I received this information from an alien.  I
			was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having
			a drink in the bar when he approached me and
			started talking.  Then he must have used some
			sort of ray or a mind control device because
			he made me follow him to his room and that's
			where he told me about the end of the world.

						VENKMAN
			Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?

						ELAINE
			It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
			up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I
			can't be sure, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (humoring her)
			No, you can't, and I think that's the whole
			problem with aliens; you just can't trust them.
			You may get some nice ones occasionally like
			Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to
			be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just
			about out of time.
				 (does his wrap-up right TO
				 the CAMERA)
			Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless
			pets.
				 (holds up a hairless cat)
			Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...
				 (puts a finger to his temple
				 and sends out a though to his
				 viewers)
			... Good night.

INT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)

Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a
well-meaning young incompetent.

						VENKMAN
			Where do you find these people?  I thought
			we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
			the spoons?

						NORMAN
			A lot of the better psychics won't come on the
			show.  They think you're too skeptical.

						VENKMAN
			Skeptical!  Norman, I'm a pushover.  I think
			professional wrestling is real.

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Norman)
			What's all this?

						NORMAN
			They just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'

						VENKMAN
			The Mayor!  He's a friend of mine.

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK
HARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.

						VENKMAN
				 (calling to the Mayor)
			Lenny!

The Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know
him.

						VENKMAN
				 (starts to follow him)
			Lenny!  It's Pete Venkman!

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkman's chest.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (snide)
			Can I help you?

						VENKMAN
				 (dangerous)
			Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.

						HARDEMEYER
			I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant.
			What can I do for you?

						VENKMAN
			I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just
			want to say hello to him.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (scornful)
			I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting
			any ghosts lately?

						VENKMAN
			No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor
			about.  We did a little job for the city a
			while back and we ended up getting sued,
			screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (bristling)
			Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall,
			barring a disaster, he's going to be elected
			governor of this state and the last thing we
			need is for him to be associated with two-bit
			frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
			friends.  You read me?

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, I get it.  But I want you to tell Lenny
			that, because of you, I'm not voting for him.

EXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors.  Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and
enters the museum.

INT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)

We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence.  Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit
by large skylights in the ceiling.  Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the
department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy.  Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana.

DANA

She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy.  Janosz
watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder.

						JANOSZ
				 (with an East European accent)
			Still working on the Turner?

Dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.

						DANA
			Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,
			Janosz.

						JANOSZ
			You know, you are really doing very good work
			here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist
			me in some of the more important restorations.

						DANA
			Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here,
			but now that my baby's a little older, I was
			hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

VIGO PAINTING

At the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his
head and looks at Dana.

JANOSZ AND DANA

Neither of them notice the movement in the painting.

						JANOSZ
				 (disappointed)
			We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I
			could take you to lunch today?

						DANA
			Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have
			an appointment.
				 (looks at her watch)
			In fact, I'd better go.

She starts gathering up her things.

						JANOSZ
			Every day I ask you, and every day you've got
			something else to do.  Do I have bad breath
			or something?

						DANA
				 (trying to brush him off)
			I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

Janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.

						JANOSZ
				 (to himself)
			I think she likes me.

He switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the
phrases as he resumes working.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY

Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building.  A sign
identifies it as "The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research."

INT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)

Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly
intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an
experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom
are Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.  The device he is testing is a black
box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic
displays.

						DANA
			... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
			dead in the middle of the street

						SPENGLER

			Did anyone else see this happen?

						DANA
			Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't
			imagine this.

						SPENGLER
			I'm not saying you did.  In science we always
			look for the simplest explanation.

An ASSISTANT interrupts.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready, Dr. Spengler

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Assistant)
			We'll start with the negative calibration.

He picks up the device and prepares to test it.

						DANA
				 (curious)
			What are you working on, Egon?

						SPENGLER
			I'm trying to determine whether human
			emotional states have a measurable effect on
			the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a
			theory Ray and I were working on when we had
			to dissolve Ghostbusters.

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually
a two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room.  Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated
arguement.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Dana)
			They think they're here for marriage
			counseling.  We've kept them waiting for two
			hours and we've been gradually increasing the
			temperature in the room.
				 (checking a heat sensor)
			It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.  Now my
			assistant is going to enter and ask them if
			they'd mind waiting another half-hour.

As Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the
waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay.  They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass.  After recording his readings, he returns to his
Assistant.

						SPENGLER
			We'll do the happiness index next.
				 (to Dana)
			I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if
			it's all right with you.

						DANA
			Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.

						SPENGLER
			Oh no.

						DANA
				 (affectedly casual)
			Do you ever see him?

						SPENGLER
			Occasionally

						DANA
			How is he these days?

						SPENGLER
			Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a
			while there.  Then he crossed the border.

						DANA
			Does he ever mention me?

						SPENGLER
			No.  Not that I can recall.

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.

						DANA
				 (slightly disappointed)
			Well, we didn't part on very good terms and
			we sort of lost track of each other when I
			got married.

The Assistant interrupts again.

						ASSISTANT
			We're ready for the affection test.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the assistant)
			Good.  Send in the puppy.

						DANA
				 (continuing)
			I thought of calling him after my marriage
			ended, but --.  Anyway, I appreciate you're
			doing this, Egon

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl.  Spengler monitors
her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.

						DANA
				 (handing him a card)
			This is my address and telephone number.
			Will you call me?

						SPENGLER
			Certainly.

						DANA
			Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of
			this to Peter if you don't mind.

						SPENGLER
			I won't.

						DANA
			Thank you.

She shakes his hand and exits.

						SPENGLER
				 (to his assistant)
			Now let's see how she reacts when we take
			away the puppy

EXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)

It's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in
Greenwich Village.  The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old
books full of arcane metaphysical lore.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.

			Ray's Occult.

INT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS

The shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.
Ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan
sweater over a T-shirt.  He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews
on a battered, reeking pipe.  As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup
of herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.

						STANTZ
				 (on the phone)
			Yeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What
			have I got?  I've got alchemy, astrology,
			apparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon
			intercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic
			surgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie
			sightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've
			got it all -- what are you looking for? ...
			Don't have any.  Try the stockyards.

He hangs up.

						SPENGLER
			Who was that?

						STANTZ
			Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come
			up with anything?

						SPENGLER
				 (referring to the book)
			This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a
			flower cart took off by itself and rolled
			approximately half a kilometer over level
			ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.

						STANTZ
			You might want to check those Duke University
			mean averaging studies on controlled
			psychokinesis.

						SPENGLER
				 (going to the stacks)
			Good idea.

The bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm
			looking for an aerosol love potion I could
			spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would
			make her unconditionally submit to an unusual
			personal request.

						STANTZ
			Oh, hiya, Pete.

						VENKMAN
			So, no goat hooves, huh?

						STANTZ
				 (strung)
			I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's
			up?  How's it going?

						VENKMAN
			Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and
			buy me a sub?

						STANTZ
				 (slightly evasive)
			Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.

Spengler steps out of the stacks.

						VENKMAN
			Egon!

						SPENGLER
			Hello, Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet
			those science chicks really dig that big
			cranium of yours, huh?

						SPENGLER
			I think they're more interested in my
			epididymis.

						VENKMAN
			I don't even want to know where that is.

Venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.

						STANTZ
			Oh, your book came in, Venkman.  Magical
			Paths to Fortune and Power.

He hands Venkman the book.

						VENKMAN
			Great.

			Oh, just checking something for an old friend.

						VENKMAN
			Who?

						STANTZ
			Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!

						VENKMAN
			Hi, Dana.

Dana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.

She regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his
presumptuousness.

						DANA
			Hello, Peter.

			You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you
			didn't call me first.  I'm still into all

			I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.

			I can see that you're still very bitter about

Stantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on
the baby and the immediate physical environment.

VENKMAN AND DANA

Venkman starts nosing around the apartment.  Dana follows him.

						VENKMAN
			So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he
			ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.

						DANA
			He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems,
			he got a good offer from an orchestra in
			England and he took it.

						VENKMAN
			He ditched you.  You should've married me,
			you know.

						DANA
			You never asked me, and every time I brought
			it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.

						VENKMAN
			Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to
			feel loved and desired, too.

						DANA
			Well, when you started introducing me as "the
			old ball and chain," that's when I left.

						VENKMAN
			I may have a few personal problems but one thing
			I am is a total professional.

He leaves her and crosses to Spengler.

SPENGLER

He's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby
with a tape measure and calipers.

						VENKMAN
			What are you going to do, Egon?  Knit him a
			snowsuit?

Spengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.

						SPENGLER
			I'd like to have a stool specimen

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or
			professional reasons?

						VENKMAN
				 (picking up the baby)
			Okay, kid.  Up you go.

He starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing
his nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking
him.

						VENKMAN
			Help!  Please somebody help me!  Get him off!
			Quickly!  He's gone completely berserk!

Dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.

						DANA
			What do you think?

						VENKMAN
			There's no doubt about it.  He's got his
			father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely
			ugly.  And smelly.
				 (resumes playing with the baby)
			You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the
			stinkiest baby I ever smelled.
				 (to Dana)
			What's his name?

						DANA
			His name is Oscar.

						VENKMAN
			Oscar!  You poor kid!

						DANA
				 (losing patience)
			Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you
			think there's anything unusual about him.

						VENKMAN
			Unusual?
				 (holds up the baby and
				 scrutinizes him)
			I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of
			experience with babies.

He looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper
off.

						DANA
				 (taking the specimen jar)
			I'll do it.

						VENKMAN
			I'll supervise.

EXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)

Dana walks down the street with Venkman, retracing the path of the
runaway buggy.  Spengler and Stantz follow, monitoring PKE valences from
the pavement and the buildings.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Dana, nostalgic)
			Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't

				 neighborhood sights)
			There's our old cash machine.  And the dry
			cleaners we used to go to.  And the old
			video store.
				 (he wipes away an imaginary
				 tear)
			We really had some good times, didn't we?

						DANA
			We definitely had a moment or two.

Dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.

						DANA
			That's where the buggy stopped.

						VENKMAN
			Okay, let's take a look.

Venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely
oblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning
like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill.  Then he signals
for Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.

						STANTZ
				 (reading the PKE meter)
			Is this the spot?

						DANA
			A little to the left.  Right there!  That's
			where it stopped.

Stantz reads the PKE meter.

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Not a trace.

						SPENGLER
			Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

						VENKMAN
			What's that?

						STANTZ
			Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
			measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
			giga electron volts.

						SPENGLER
			That's a thousand million electron volts.

						VENKMAN
			I knew that.

Spengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the
lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.
The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING
WILDLY.

						STANTZ
			I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's
			something brewing under the street.

						DANA
				 (worried, to Venkman)
			Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic
			problem or something that makes me vulnerable
			to these supernatural things.

						VENKMAN
			You mean like the time you got possessed and
			turned into a monster terror dog?  No, not
			a chance.  Total coincidence.

			Am I right?

Stantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the

crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body,
driving him to his knees.

PAINTING

The figure of Vigo comes to life, turns toward Janosz and gestures
dramatically at him.  Then he speaks to Janosz in a commanding voice.

						VIGO
			I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the
			sorrow of Moldavia, command you.

						JANOSZ
				 (in agony)
			Command me, lord.

						VIGO
			On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain,
			I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will
			be, what is will be no more.  Now is the
			season of evil.  Find me a child that I might
			live again.

Bolts of red-hot energy shoot from the eyes of Vigo into Janosz's eyes.
He screams and falls to his knees.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT

Venkman and Stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee,
sandwiches and Danish and start walking up the street.

						VENKMAN
			I love this.  We're onto something really
			big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to
			make some headlines with this one.

						STANTZ
			Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts?
			If anybody found out about this we'd be in
			serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have
			been clearer - no ghostbusting.

						VENKMAN
			Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing
			nice and quiet, low key, no profile.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Spengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the
street.  Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is
lit by strong work lights.

POLICE CAR

It turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift
worksite and stops.  The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler
doesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.
Finally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.

						FIRST COP
			How ya doing?

						SPENGLER
				 (reeking with guilt)
			Fine!  It's cutting fine now.

						FIRST COP
				 (curious)
			Why are you cutting?

						SPENGLER
				 (looking for one of the
				 others)
			Why are we cutting?  Uh - boss!

Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.

						FIRST COP
			What are you doing here?

						VENKMAN
				 (belligerent)
			What the hell's it look like we're doing?
			We're bustin out asses over here 'cause
			some douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'
			better to do than make idiots like us work
			late on a Friday night, right?
				 (looks to Spengler for
				 agreement)

						SPENGLER
				 (with a "right on" fist)
			Yo.

The cops seem satisfied by the explanation.

						FIRST COP
			Okay, boys, take it easy.

They drive off.  Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders.

						SPENGLER
			You were supposed to help me with this.

						VENKMAN
			You need the exercise.

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole.  Suddenly he hits metal.  They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.

						STANTZ
				 (examing it)
			NYPRR.  What the hell -- ?  Help me lift
			this.

They prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss.

						STANTZ
				 (shining a flashlight into
				 the hole)
			Wow!  It's an old airshaft.  It just goes
			forever.

Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.

						SPENGLER
			Very intense.  We need a deeper reading.
			Somebody has to go down there.

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray.

						STANTZ
			Thanks, boys.

They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong
cable attached to a winch.  Ray calls out orders to them as he descends
deeper and deeper.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (his voice echoing in the
				 airshaft)
			Keep going -- more -- more --

INT.  HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent
in total darkness.

						STANTZ
				 (using a radio now)
			Lower -- lower --
				 (to himself)
			Gee, this really is deep.

Suddenly, his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!  Steady!

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into
the tunnel below.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - NIGHT

He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded, polished tile walls ardorned with intricate, colorfully enameled
Art Nouveau mosaics.  A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION.

STANTZ

He pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ
				 (reverently)
			This is it, boys, the end of the line.  Van
			Horne Station.  The old New York Pneumatic.
			It's still here.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman has no idea what he's talking about.

						SPENGLER
				 (explaining)
			The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an
			experimental subway system.  Fan-forced
			air-trains, built around 1870.

						STANTZ
				 (over the walkie-talkie)
			This is about as deep as you can go under
			Manhattan without digging your own hole.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			What's the reading?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely
high reading.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Off the top of the scale.  This place is
			really hot.  Lower me to the floor.

As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight
down the wall of the station, then onto the floor.

						STANTZ
				 (shouts)
			Hold it!!  Stop!!  Whoa!!

INT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze.

As he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in
the bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING
through ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,
and mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain
-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad
and eerie symphony.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT

						STANTZ
				 (ranting on the radio)
			Oh, my God!  It's a seething, bubbling,
			psychic cess!  Interlocked tubes of plasm,
			crackling with negative GEVs!  It's glowing
			and moving!  It's -- it's a river of slime!!

STANTZ

He dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he
can.  He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on
it, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.
Reaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting
the pole.

SLIME

Suddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of
the slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet.  He jerks his legs up
as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.

						STANTZ
				 (on the radio)
			Haul me up, Venkman!  Now!

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's
car drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier.  A
burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two
cops.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (no nonsense)
			Okay, what's the story here?

Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the
belligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex
hardhat.

						VENKMAN
			What, I got time for this?  We got three
			thousand phones out in the Village and about
			eight million miles of cable to check.

						SUPERVISOR
				 (not buying it)
			The phone lines are over there.
				 (points to the curb)

Venkman pops Spengler on the head.

						VENKMAN
			I told ya!

Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
				 (filtered)
			Help!  Help!  Pull me up!  It's alive!  It's
			eating my boots.

Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie.

						FIRST COP
			You ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.
			We checked.  Tell me another one.

Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			Gas leak?

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME

Stantz is hanging there, looking down into the shaft at the slime which
is now bubbling up the shaft after him.

						STANTZ
				 (shouting)
			Get me out of here!!

Desperate now, he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old,
rusting conduit.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line, ripping
through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman, Spengler, the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz.

EXT.  EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT

One by one, all the streetlights go out; then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street; then the whole neighborhood blacks
out, and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness.

						STANTZ (O.S.)
			Sorry.

INT. DANA BARRETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over
the living room.  Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for
information about the blackout.  She listens to a special news report
for a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door
and looks in.  Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.
Leaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz
standing in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of
the hallway.  He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.

						DANA
				 (surprised)
			Janosz?

						JANOSZ
			Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the
			neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to
			see if everything's all right with you --
			you know, with the blackout and everything?
			Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

His affected concern is chilling.  She is frightened but conceals it
from him.

						DANA
				 (mechanically and cautiously)
	We're fine, Janosz.

He tires to look around her into the apartment.

						JANOSZ
			Do you need anything?  You want me to come
			in?

						DANA
			No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks
			anyway.

						JANOSZ
			Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night,
			Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs
			bite you.

						DANA
			Good night, Janosz.

She closes the door behind him and double locks it, then stands there
staring into the candlelight, alone and afraid.

INT.  HALLWAY OF DANA'S BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz stands there in semi-darkness, then his eyes light up like
headlights and he walks off down the hall.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY

The JUDGE, a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school, calls the
court to order.

						JUDGE
			I want to make one thing very clear before
			we go any further.  The law does not recognize
			the existence of ghosts, and I don't believe
			in them either, so I don't want to hear a
			lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and
			demons.  We're going to stick to the facts
			in this case and save the ghost stories for
			the kiddies.  Understood?

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz leans over and whispers to Spengler.

						STANTZ
			Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?

						SPENGLER
			His nickname is "The Hammer."

Stantz and Spengler are seated with their attorney LOUIS TULLY, lawyer,
CPA and former demonic possession victim.  Louis is desperately paging
through a mountain of legal textbooks.

						LOUIS
				 (nervous)
			I think you're making a big mistake here,
			fellas.  I do mostly tax law and some probate
			stuff occasionally.  I got my law degree at
			night school.

						STANTZ
			That's all right.  We got arrested at night.

SPECTATORS' GALLERY

Venkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.

						DANA
			I wish I could stay.  I feel personally
			responsible for you being here.

						VENKMAN
			You are personally responsible.  If I can
			get conjugal rights, will you visit me at
			Sing Sing?

						DANA
			Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.

						DANA
			You mean you cough up hairballs all over
			the rug?

						VENKMAN
			I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.

						DANA
				 (sincerely)
			Good luck.

						VENKMAN
			Thanks.

She gives him a quick, unexpected kiss and exits.  Venkman savors it for
a moment then goes back to the defense table.

PROSECUTION TABLE

Jack Hardemeyer, the mayor's principal aide, is goading the PROSECUTOR,
a very sober, humorless woman in her late thirties.

						HARDEMEYER
			How are you doing, hon?  Just put these guys
			away fast and make sure they go away for a
			long, long time.

						PROSECUTOR
			It shouldn't be hard with this list of charges.

						HARDEMEYER
			Good.  Very good.  The mayor and future
			governor won't forget this.

He smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table
on his way out of the courtroom.

DEFENSE TABLE

The Ghostbusters look up as Hardemeyer approaches.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (gloating)
			Nice going, Venkman.  Violating a judicial
			restraining order, willful destruction of
			public property, fraud, malicious mischief
			-- smooth move.  See you in a couple years
			-- at your first parole hearing.

Herdemeyer exits.  Louis looks devastated.

						LOUIS
			Gee, the whole city's against us.  I think
			I'm going to be sick.

Spengler hands him a waste basket as the Prosecutor calls her first
witness.

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - DAY (LATER)

The Con Ed Supervisor is testifying.

						PROSECUTOR
			Mr. Fianella, please look at Exhibits A
			through F on the table over there.  Do you
			recognize that equipment?

EXHIBIT TABLE

Lying on the table are the basic tools of the Ghostbusting trade: three
proton packs and particle throwers, a couple of ghost traps, and various
meters and detection devices.

						CON ED
				 (o.c.)
			That's the stuff the cops found in their
			truck.

WITNESS STAND

She continues.

						PROSECUTOR
			Do you know what this equipment is used for?

						CON ED
				 (shrugs)
			I don't know.  Catching ghosts, I guess.

						PROSECUTOR
				 (to the Judge)
			May I remind the court that the defendants
			are under a judicial restraining order that
			specifically forbids them from performing
			services as paranormal investigators and
			eliminators.

						JUDGE
			So noted.

						PROSECUTOR
			Now, Mr. Fianella, can you identify the
			substance in the jar on the table marked
			Exhibit F?

PROSECUTOR

She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the
slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel.

						CON ED
			I been working underground for Con Ed for
			27 years and I never saw anything like that
			in my life.  We checked out that tunnel the
			next day and we didn't find nothing.  If it
			was down there, they must have put it there.

DEFENSE TABLE

Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz.

						STANTZ
				 (defensively)
			Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have
			been ten thousand gallons of it down there.

						SPENGLER
			It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal
			source.

						LOUIS
				 (nervously)
			Should I say that?

						SPENGLER
			I doubt that they'd believe us.

Louis moans and goes back to his notes.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER

Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him.

						LOUIS
			So like you were just trying to help out
			your old friend because she was scared and
			you didn't really mean to do anything bad
			and you really love the city and won't ever
			do anything like this again, right?

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection, your Honor.  He's leading the
			witness.

						JUDGE
			The witness is leading him.  Sustained.

						LOUIS
			Okay, let me rephrase that question.
				 (to venkman)
			Didn't you once coach a basketball team for
			underprivileged children?

						VENKMAN
			Yes, I did.  We were city champs.

						PROSECUTOR
			Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

						JUDGE
			Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything
			to ask this witness that may have some
			bearing on this case?

						LOUIS
				 (to Venkman)
			Do I?

						VENKMAN
			No, I think you've helped them enough already.

						LOUIS
				 (to the Judge)
			No, I guess not.
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Your witness.

The Prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish.

						PROSECUTOR
			So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court
			why it is you and your co-defendants took it
			upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
			middle of the street.

						VENKMAN
			Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many
			holes already we didn't think anyone would
			notice.

The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order.

						JUDGE
			Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in
			contempt.

						VENKMAN
			Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets
			me up like that I can't resist.

						PROSECUTOR
			I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were
			you digging the hole?  And please remember
			that you're under oath.

						VENKMAN
			I had my fingers crossed when they swore me
			in, but I'm going to tell you the truth.
			There are things in this world that go way
			beyond human understanding, things that
			can't be explained and that most people don't
			want to know about anyway.  That's where we
			come in.

						PROSECUTOR
			So what are you saying?  That the world of
			the supernatural is your special province?

						VENKMAN
			No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens
			and somebody has to deal with it.

The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.

												 WIPE TO:

INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

The trial is nearing its end.  The Judge calls on Louis to make his
summation.

						JUDGE
			Does the counsel for the defense wish to
			make any final arguements?

Louis rises.

						LOUIS
			Your honor, may I approach the bench?

						JUDGE
				 (impatient)
			Yes.

Louis crosses to the judge's bench.

						LOUIS
				 (to the judge)
			Can I have some of your water?

						JUDGE
			Get on with it, counselor!

						LOUIS
				 (scared)
			Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --
				 (he remembers there's no
				 jury)
			audience.  I don't think it's fair to call
			my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was
			a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in
			an elevator for about three hours and I had
			to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I
			don't blame them because once I turned into
			a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.

He goes back to the defense table and sits down.  Stantz and Spengler
hang their heads.  Venkman pats Louis on the back.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Louis)
			Way to go.  Concise and to the point.

JUDGE

He stares at Louis, astonished at his summation.

						JUDGE
			That's it?  That's all you have to say?

						LOUIS
			Did I forget something?

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes.

						JUDGE
			That was unquestionably the worst
			presentation of a case I've ever heard in a
			court of law!  I ought to cite you for
			contempt and have you disbarred.  As for
			your clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz
			and Egon Spengler, on the charges of
			conspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction
			of public property, I find you guilty on all
			counts.  I order you to pay fines in the
			amount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to
			eighteen months in the city correctional
			facility at Ryker's Island.

STANTZ

He sees the activity in the jar

						STANTZ
			Uh-oh, she's twitchin'.

THE BENCH

The Judge continues

						JUDGE
			And on a more personal note, let me go on
			record as saying that there is no place in
			decent society for fakes, charlatans and
			tricksters like you who prey on the
			gullibility of innocent people.  You're
			beneath the contempt of this court.  And
			believe me, if my hands were not tied by the
			unalterable fetters of the law, a law which
			has become in my view far too permissive and
			inadequate in it's standards of punishment,
			I would invoke the tradition of our
			illustrious forebearers, reach back to a
			sterner, purer justice and have you burned
			at the stake!

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily.  Then
he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom.

SPECIMEN JAR

The slime starts to pulse and swell, pushing up the lid on the jar.

DEFENSE TABLE

Stantz anticipates big trouble.

						STANTZ
			Under the table, boys!

The Ghostbusters duck under the defense table.

LOUIS

He stands up and looks around fearfully.

INT.  COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases.  All eyes turn to the
exhibit table.  Then suddenly all Hell breaks loose as TWO FULL-TORSO
APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar.

JUDGE

He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and
recognizes them immediately.

						JUDGE
				 (in horror)
			Oh, my God!  The Scoleri Brothers!

SCOLERI BROTHERS

Big in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten
feet tall.  They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are
metal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still
attached.  Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their
bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to
get at the Judge.

JUDGE

Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the
spectral intruders.

						JUDGE
				 (terrified)
			You've got to do something!

						VENKMAN
			Who are they?

						JUDGE
			They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them
			for murder.  They were electrocuted up at
			Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.

						VENKMAN
			Maybe they just want to appeal.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.

PROSECUTOR

She sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge
with them.

						VENKMAN
			These boys aren't playing around.

						JUDGE
				 (desperately)
			You've got to stop them.  Please!

						LOUIS
				 (thinking like a lawyer)
			Violating a judicial restraining order could
			expose my clients to serious criminal
			penalties.  As their attorney I'd have to
			advise them against it.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They start punching through the jury box.

JUDGE

He is just about hysterical with fear.

						JUDGE
			All right!  All right!  I'm recinding the
			order.  Case dismissed!!
				 (he pounds his gavel on
				 the floor)
			Now do something!

						STANTZ
			Let's go to work, boys.

With that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were
being displayed as evidence.  They strap them on hastily as the Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.

						VENKMAN
				 (slinging the pack onto
				 his back)
			Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.

						STANTZ
				 (grabbing other gear)
			Okay, let's heat 'em up!

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers.

						STANTZ
			All right, throwers.  Set for full neutronas
			on stream.

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them.

						VENKMAN
			Hey!  Why don't you pick on someone your own
			size?

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot
lightning at their new adversaries.

						STANTZ
				 (to the others)
			On my signal, boys.  Open 'em up -- Now!

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Spengs, take the door.  Ray, let's try and
			work them down and into the corner.

Working as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the
streams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on
the floor.

						STANTZ
			Watch it!  I'm coming under you, Pete.

They circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while
ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers.  Finally, Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of
light energy.

						STANTZ
			Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
			Venky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him
			down -- trapping -- trapping -- now!

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the
traps which snap shut.

INT.  COURTROOM - TRAPS - DAY

LEDs on the outer casing start flashing, indicating the presence of a
ghost inside each trap.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking the trap)
			Occupado.

INT.  COURTROOM - JUDGE - DAY (AFTER GHOST BATTLE)

He sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and
looks around in total amazement.

LOUIS

He crawls out from under a chair.  Reporters and spectators get back on
their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation.

PROSECUTOR

She's lying on the floor, attended to by the Bailiff and the Court Clerk.

						SPENGLER
				 (to the Prosecutor)
			Brilliant summation.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of
them standing in the wrecked courtroom.

						VENKMAN
			Case closed, boys.  We're back in business.

The spectators cheer and applaud.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

The old, dilapidated Ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground,
dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder, and the new logo is hoisted
into place over the main entrance.  It's just like the original "No
Ghosts" logo, but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding
up two fingers.  Venkman enters the firehouse.

INT.  BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT

A man and his wife are lying in bed reading.  The man is played by Louis
Tully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,
is playing his wife.  They are both terrible actors.  Suddenly, a ghost,
actually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom.  Janine
sees it and screams.

						LOUIS
			What is it, honey?

						JANINE
			It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know
			what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us
			alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.

						LOUIS
			Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.

He picks up the phone.

						JANINE
			Who are you going to call?

						LOUIS
				 (with a wink)
			Ghostbusters.

As he starts to dial, the CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the Ghostbusters
standing in the bedroom.  Their acting isn't much better than Louis and
Janine's.

GHOSTBUSTERS

Stantz speaks directly TO the CAMERA.

						STANTZ
			I'm Ray --

						VENKMAN
			I'm Peter --

						SPENGLER
			I'm Egon --

						STANTZ
			And we're the ...

						ALL
				 (together)
			Ghostbusters.

						STANTZ
			That's right -- Ghostbusters.  We're back
			and we're better than ever with twice the
			know-how and twice the particle-power to
			deal with all your supernatural elimination
			needs.

During his speech, Winston can be seen in the b.g. pretending to trap the
fake ghost.

						STANTZ
			Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.
				 (TO CAMERA)
			And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're
			giving you twice the value with our special
			half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.

						VENKMAN
			Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone
			crazy?

						STANTZ
			I guess so, Pete, because that's not all.
			Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

Spengler actually mouths everyone else's dialogue along with them,
waiting for his cue.

						SPENGLER
			You mean the Ghostbusters hot beverage
			thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids?

He holds up a mug and a limp, uninflated balloon.

						STANTZ
			You bet.

As Stantz wraps it up, SUPERS APPEAR at the bottom of the SCREEN: FULLY
BONDED - FULLY LICENSED - SE HABLA ESPANOL.

						STANTZ
				 (TO CAMERA)
			So don't wait another minute.  Make your
			supernatural problem our supernatural problem.
			Call now, because we're still --

						ALL
				 (in unison, mechanically)
			-- Ready to believe you.

INT.  JACK HARDEMEYER'S OFFICE - DAY

Hardemeyer is watching the Ghostbusters commercial on a TV in his office.
He bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches OFF the TV.

EXT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY (LATER)

The garage door opens and the new improved ECTOMOBILE comes ROARING out
onto the street, its ghostly SIREN MOANING and WAILING.  Louis comes
running out after it.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor.
He sniffs around, following the smell.

						LOUIS
			Oh, geez, smells like somebody took a really
			big --

He freezes.

INT. OFFICE AREA - LOUIS'S POV

Slimer, a spud-like green ghost, is hovering over Louis's desk, scarfing
down Louis's bag lunch.  Slimer looks up and sees Louis.

SLIMER AND LOUIS

They both scream and run off in opposite directions.

SLIMER

He passes right through a wall and disappears.

LOUIS

He runs right into a wall, recovers and exits in a hurry.

						LOUIS
				 (screaming)
			Help!  There's a thing!

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DAY (LATER)

Runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog
along the track that circles the reservoir.  One of the runners looks
behind him at the sound of APPROACHING FOOTFALLS and screams.

GHOSTLY JOGGER

A ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace.  Other runners
stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them.  Seemingly
oblivious to the effect he's having, the ghost jogger puts two fingers to
his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse.

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - DAY (SAME TIME)

Venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the
newspaper, eating a donut and drinking coffee from a Styrofoam cup.

STANTZ

He's sitting on a bench opposite Venkman's, casually watching the jogging
track.

GHOST JOGGER

He approaches the benches where the Ghostbusters are waiting.  As the
ghost jogger passes the benches, Stantz and Venkman simultaneously hit
concealed control buttons.  A ghost trap buried in the track throws up a
glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid-stride.
Stantz and Venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger.

						VENKMAN
				 (checking his watch)
			You know he ran that last lap in under six
			minutes?

						STANTZ
			If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic
			prospect.

EXT.  JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The Ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps, wearing cheap
dime-store Santa Claus hats.

						STANTZ

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - ORREFORS GLASS STORE - DAY

The Ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the
Ghostbusters enter the store.

INT.  ORREFORS GLASS STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

All the precious crystal is floating in the air, several feet above the
glass shelves and display tables.  Stantz and Venkman are talking to the
manager while Winston and Spengler set up an array of electronic devices
positioned in each corner of the store.

On a signal from Stantz, Spengler and Winston switch on the devices which
throw laser-type beams around the perimeter of the store.  The manager
watches in horror as all the GLASSWARE suddenly drops out of the air,
SMASHES through the GLASS SHELVES and SHATTERS on the display tables.
There is a long pregnant pause.

						STANTZ
				 (to the manager)
			So will that be cash or a check?

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Everyone else has gone home.  Dana is cleaning her brushes and putting
her supplies away.

VIGO PAINTING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Vigo turns his head and watches Dana as she walks past the painting.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - DAY

Louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area.  We PAN
DOWN TO the floor and see a foot pedal, then PAN ALONG the cord TO a
ghost trap sitting on Louis's desk.  Hanging from strings over the desk
are several pieces of Kentucky fried chicken.

WALL

Slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the
chicken bait.  He licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to
the chicken.

LOUIS

His eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.

						LOUIS
				 (shouts)
			Gotcha!

DESK

The trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy.  Slimer
dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down
on Louis's desk.

						LOUIS
				 (seeing the damage)
			Uh-oh.

He slinks off, defeated.

INT.  MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - SECURITY DESK - DAY

The Ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable TV on the security
desk.  Rudy, the Security Guard, is reading a National Enquirer with a
giant front-page headline: GHOSTBUSTERS SAVE JUDGE.  Venkman enters.

						VENKMAN
			I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

						SECURITY GUARD
			Room 304 -- Restorations.
				 (recognizing him)
			Hey!  Dr. Venkman -- 'World of the Psychic.'
			I'm a big, big fan.  That used to be one of
			my two favorite shows.

						VENKMAN
				 (flattered)
			Thanks.  What's the other one?

						SECURITY GUARD
			'Bass Masters.'  It's a fishing show.  Ever
			see it?

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, really great.  Take it easy.

He exits.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer.  Janosz is
at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of Vigo.
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the Ver Meer)
			So this is what you do, huh?

						DANA
				 (glad to see him)
			Oh, hello, Peter.

						VENKMAN
			You're really good, you know.

						DANA
			I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it.
			It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about
			ten million dollars.

VIGO

He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana.

VENKMAN

Unaware that he's being watched, Venkman squints at the still life,
holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.

						VENKMAN
			You know you can go to Art World and get
			these huge sofa-size paintings for about
			forty-five bucks.

He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.

						DANA
			I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk
			about art.

						VENKMAN
			As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell
			you that I haven't forgotten your problem
			and that we're still on the case.

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz.

						JANOSZ
				 (smiling at Venkman)
			Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to
			your friend?

						DANA
			Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman.
			Peter, Janosz Poha.

Venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.

						JANOSZ
				 (avoiding his gaze)
			Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on
			television.

						VENKMAN
			How are you?
				 (looking over at the Vigo
				 painting)
			What's that you're working on, Johnny?

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go.  Venkman and Dana cross to
the Vigo painting.  Janosz steps protectively in front of it.

						JANOSZ
			It's a painting I'm restoring for the new
			Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait
			of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled
			most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
			Century.

						VENKMAN
				 (staring at the painting)
			Too bad for the Moldavians.

						JANOSZ
				 (defensive)

			He was a very powerful magician.  A genius
			in many ways and quite a skilled painter.

						DANA
			He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman.
			I hate this painting.  I've felt very
			uncomfortable since they brought it up from
			storage.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want
			to hang in the rec room.  You know what it
			needs?
				 (picking up a brush)
			A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

Venkman reaches toward the painting, but Janosz grabs his hand.

						JANOSZ
				 (with forced good will)
			We don't go around altering valuable
			paintings, Dr. Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			Well, I'd make an exception in this case if
			I were you.

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting
			you.

						JANOSZ
			My pleasure.

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			I may be wrong, but I think you've got a
			little crush on this guy.

						DANA
			Good-bye, Peter.

						VENKMAN
				 (dragging his feet)
			I'd like to stay, but I really don't have
			time to hang around here.  I'll call you.
				 (calls out to Janosz)
			Later, Johnny!

He exits.

VIGO

Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench.

DANA

She stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the
painting.  As she starts to walk on, Vigo looks at her again, but Dana
turns suddenly and catches the movement.  Frightened now, she hastily
leaves the studio.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the lab
area.

						STANTZ
			Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have
			something really amazing to show you.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Spengler)
			It's not that thing you do with your
			nostrils, is it?

Stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among
the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container.

						STANTZ
				 (to Venkman)
			We've been studying the stuff that we took
			from the subway tunnel.

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.

						VENKMAN
			And now you're going to eat it?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish.

						STANTZ
			Now watch this.

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.

						STANTZ
				 (simulating anger)
			You worthless piece of slime!!
				 (as the slime starts to
				 twitch and glow)
			You ignorant disgusting blob!!

SPECIMEN

It bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.

						STANTZ
			You foul, obnoxious muck!!

STANTZ

He continues venting his rage on the slime.

						STANTZ
			I've seen some real crud in my time, but
			you're a chemical disgrace!!

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish.

STANTZ AND SPENGLER

They turn to Venkman for his reaction.  He's dumbfounded.

						VENKMAN
			This is what you do with your spare time?

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman.
			A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this
			is, it clearly responds to human emotional
			states.

						VENKMAN
			'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff
			and sell it.

						SPENGLER
			We've found it at every event site we've
			been to lately.

						WINSTON
				 (poking at the slime)
			You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad
			vibes'?

						STANTZ
			Like a goat on garbage.

						STANTZ
			We're running tests to see if we can get an
			equally strong positive reaction.

						VENKMAN
			What kind of tests?

						STANTZ
				 (a little embarrassed)
			Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say
			supportive, nurturing things --

						VENKMAN
			You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

Spengler reacts as if he might be.

						STANTZ
			It really responds to music.
				 (to Spengler)
			Let's calm it down.

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing "Cumbaya" to
the slime specimen.

SPECIMEN

It stops bubbling and starts to shrink.

						WINSTON
			Does it have any favorites?

						STANTZ
			It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,'
			'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small
			World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster.

						STANTZ
			Watch this.

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilson's "HIGHER AND HIGHER"
BLASTS from the speakers.

TOASTER

It shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC.

VENKMAN

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.

						VENKMAN
			I don't care what you say.  This could be a
			major Christmas gift item.

						WINSTON
			Right, and the first time someone gets mad,
			their toaster will eat their hand.

						VENKMAN
			So we'll put a warning on the label.

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving.  Venkman looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the toaster)
			Go ahead.  I dare you.

Suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and won't let go.  The others jump in to help him, but Venkman laughs and
easily withdraws his hand.

						VENKMAN
			Just kidding.

INT.  DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet.  She's
wearing a robe over her nightgown, preparing to bathe the baby.  She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub, checks the water
temperature, then turns away and starts to undress the baby.

						DANA
				 (talking sweetly to the
				 baby)
			Look at you.  I think we got more food on
			your shirt than we got in your mouth.

BATHTUB

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub.  Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub.  When she turns away, both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges.

DANA

Still unaware, she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub.

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the
bubble bath.

DANA
She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub.
She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth.  Dana screams, snatches the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture, old
magazines, books, tapes, and sports equipment.  Venkman is asleep on the
floor, still wearing his coat, scarf, hat and gloves, having collapsed
just short of the bedroom.  The DOORBELL RINGS, he wakes up, lumbers to
his feet and answers it.  He opens the door and sees Dana standing there.
She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked,
wrapped in a baby blanket.

						DANA
				 (somewhat embarrassed to
				 be there)
			I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?

						VENKMAN
				 (surprised to see her)
			No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago.
			Come on in.
				 (noting her apparel)
			Are we having a pajama party?

						DANA
				 (upset)
			Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

Venkman looks at her for a long moment.

						VENKMAN
			You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd
			have serious doubts.  But coming from you,
			I can't honestly say I'm surprised.

						DANA
			I must be losing my mind.  At the museum
			today I could have sworn that terrible
			painting of Vigo looked right at me.

						VENKMAN
			Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this
			nightgown?

						DANA
				 (distraught)
			I don't know what to do anymore.

						VENKMAN
			I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the
			bathtub.  You better stay here.

He exits to the bathroom.  She looks around the loft, amazed at the
disorder.  Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her.

						VENKMAN
			Now this kid has a serious nudity problem.

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa, lays the baby on it and starts
tying it around him like a diaper.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the baby)
			This is Joe Namath's old number, you know.
			You could get a lot of chicks with this.
			Just don't pee in it.

						DANA
			Peter, what about the bathtub?

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the phone and dials)
			We'll take care of that.
				 (on the phone)
			Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right
			away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
			tried to eat the kid.

						DANA
			It was full of this awful pink ooze.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray)
			Sounds like another slime job ... No,
			they're all right.  They're here now ...
			Right ... Let me know.

He hangs up.

						VENKMAN
			They're going over there right now.  You
			might as well make yourself at home.  Let
			me show you around.
				 (he crosses to the kitchen area)
			This is the cuisine de maison --

It's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the
counters are littered with all sorts of food trash.  He grabs a big open
Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.

						VENKMAN
				 (looking at the sink)
			We may have to wash some of these if you get
			hungry --
				 (he looks in the fridge)
			-- but there's no food anyway so forget
			about it.  I have all kinds of carry-out
			menus if you feel like ordering.

He opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then
crosses to the bathroom.

						VENKMAN
			Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy
			up a few things.

						DANA
			Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have
			to do any of this, you know.

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING
and more items going into the Hefty bag.

						VENKMAN (O.S.)
			The shower works but it's a little tricky.
			They're both marked "Hot."  It takes a little
			practice, but at least this one won't try
			and eat you.

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder.

						VENKMAN
			Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.
			But the bed's good and I just changed the
			sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In
			fact, I think you should definitely plan on
			spending the night here.

						DANA
			Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping
			arrangements?

						VENKMAN
			For me it's best if I sleep on my side and
			you spoon up right behind me with your arms
			around me.  If we go the other way I'm
			afraid your hair will be getting in my face
			all night.

						DANA
			How about you on the sofa and me in bed with
			the baby.

						VENKMAN
			Or we could do that.

						DANA
			Thank you.
				 (she picks up Oscar)
			Poor baby.  I think I should put him down
			now.

						VENKMAN
			I'll put him down for you.
				 (taking the baby)
			You are way too short!  And your belly-button
			sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to
			your poor mother!

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.

EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.

						VENKMAN
			Did you find anything at Dana's?

						STANTZ
			Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in
			and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up
			some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
			you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the
			Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,
			Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

						SPENGLER
				 (reads from xerox of entry)
			"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"

						VENKMAN
			A hundred and five years?  He really hung
			on, didn't he.

						STANTZ
			And he didn't die of old age either.  He was
			poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,
			disemboweled, drawn and quartered.

						WINSTON
			I guess he wasn't too popular at the end
			there.

						SPENGLER
			No, not exactly a man of the people.
				 (reads)
			"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the
			Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the
			Unholy."

						STANTZ
			This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in
			all the Black Arts, and listen to this
			prophecy.  Just before his head died, his
			last words were, "Death is but a door, time
			is but a window.  I'll be back."

						VENKMAN
			That's it?  "I'll be back?"

						SPENGLER
			It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

They enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.

INT.  MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.

						RUDY
			Hey, Dr. Venkman.  What's going on?

						VENKMAN
			We're just going up to Restorations for a
			minute.

						RUDY
			Oh, I can't let you do that.  Mr. Poha told
			me not to let you up there anymore.

						VENKMAN
				 (with mock seriousness)
			Okay, we were trying to keep this quiet but
			I think you can be trusted.  Tell him, Ray.

						STANTZ
				 (very official)
			Mister, you have an Ecto-paritic,
			subfusionary flux in this building.

						RUDY
			We got a flux?

						WINSTON
			You got a flux and a half.

						STANTZ
			Now if you don't want to be the --
				 (he counts)
			-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock
			from a planar rift, I suggest you get down
			behind that desk and don't move until we
			give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters
head upstairs.

INT.  MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Janosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter.  He
rushes over and stops them at the door.

						JANOSZ
			Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.

						VENKMAN
			I know.

						JANOSZ
			Then why have you come?

						VENKMAN
			We got a major creep alert and we're just
			going down the list.  Your name was first.

						STANTZ
				 (to Spengler and Winston)
			Let's sweep it, boys.

They deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Janosz)
			You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you
			from, Johnny?

						JANOSZ
				 (nervous)
			The Upper West Side.

						SPENGLER
				 (consulting his PKE meter)
			This entire room is extremely hot, Peter.

						JANOSZ
			What exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?

						VENKMAN
			We'll know when we find it.  You just sit
			tight.  This won't take long.

STANTZ

Using the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to
the painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio.  Venkman
comes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.

						VENKMAN
			This is the one that looked at Dana.

						JANOSZ
			It must be the chemical fumes in the studio.
			People start imagining things --

						VENKMAN
				 (interrupts)
			I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing
			theory.  If she says it looked at her, it
			looked at her.
				 (to Vigo)
			Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking
			to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking
			to you.

They watch the painting for any sign of movement.

VIGO

His eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.

STANTZ AND VENKMAN

Venkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Vigo)
			Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby.
			Just have fun with it.
				 (to Stantz)
			Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish
			up and get out of here.

						STANTZ
			I'll get one more reading.

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting.  Stantz scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.

VIGO

His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.

STANTZ

He stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle
transformation occurs within him.  Winston comes up behind him and breaks
the spell.

						WINSTON
				 (looking at the painting)
			Now that's one ugly dude.

						STANTZ
				 (coming back to his senses)
			Huh?  What?

						WINSTON
			You finished here?

						STANTZ
				 (distracted)
			What?  Yeah.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?  You coming down with
			something?

						STANTZ
			No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for

They head for the door.

JANOSZ

He escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.

						JANOSZ
			So you see, everything is in order, is it

						VENKMAN
			Not.  Don't leave town and report any change

			There's definitely something going on in
			that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus
			and the Giga-meter was showing all red.

						WINSTON
			I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, that's a safe bet.
				 (to Stantz)
			You and Spengman see what else you can dig
			up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.
			Those two were made for each other.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)

The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse.  Stantz is at the
wheel.  His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense.  Stantz
swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.

						STANTZ
				 (to another driver)
			Idiot!
				 (honking)
			Move it, you jerk!

Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously
through traffic.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Winston looks at Ray, concerned.

						WINSTON
			Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray?

Stantz turns on him.

						STANTZ
				 (viciously)
			Are you telling me how to drive?

						WINSTON
			No, I just thought --

						STANTZ
			Well don't think!

He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.

EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue.  Pedestrians leap to safety as
Stantz runs a red light.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.

						WINSTON
				 (to Stantz, really worried
				 now)
			Are you crazy, man?  You're going to kill
			somebody!

Stantz looks at him and smile demonically.

						STANTZ
			No, I'm going to kill everybody!

He swerves off the road.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car heads right for a big tree.

INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel
and steps across to stomp on the brakes.

EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The car skids into the tree and stops.  The Ghostbusters stumble out
dazed and shaken, but unhurt.  Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the
others, completely at a loss.

						STANTZ
				 (himself again)
			What happened?

						VENKMAN
			You just picked up three penalty points on
			your driver's license.

						WINSTON
			Are you all right?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest
			thing.  I knew what I was doing but I
			couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling
			came over me and -- I don't know -- I just
			felt like driving into that tree and ending
			it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

They inspect the damage to the car.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially, to
				 Spengler)
			Watch him, Egon.  Don't even let him shave.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)

There's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman
enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small
suitcase of Dana's.

						VENKMAN
				 (calls out)
			I'm home!

He looks around the large open loft.

						VENKMAN
				 (to himself)
			I knew it.  She cleaned.

He hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom.  The door is
half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through
the transparent vinyl curtain.  He closes the bathroom door and looks at
the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling
off.  Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel.  She jumps back into the bathroom.

She comes out again, this time wearing a robe.

						VENKMAN
			Are you all squeaky clean now?

						DANA
				 (humoring him)
			Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything
			at my apartment?

She squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.

						VENKMAN
				 (through the door)
			Nothing.  They stayed there all night, went
			through your personal stuff, made a bunch of
			long-distance phone calls and cleaned out
			your refrigerator.  And didn't find anything.

Dana opens the bedroom door.

						DANA
			They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub
			... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do
			I do now?

						VENKMAN
			Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a
			babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you
			need it.

						DANA
			I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar
			in a strange place with someone I don't know.

						VENKMAN
			It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's
			one of my most valuable employees.

						DANA
			Does she know anything about babies?

						VENKMAN
			Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?
				 (handing her the flowers)
			Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your
			clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I
			brought along some interesting possibilities.

						DANA
			Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.

She smiles and closes the door again.  He opens the closet and starts
looking for his good suit.

						VENKMAN
			Did you happen to see some shirts on the
			floor in here?

						DANA (O.S.)
			I put them in your hamper.  I thought they
			were dirty.

						VENKMAN
				 (shaking his head)
			I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first,
			okay.  I have more than two grades of
			laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels
			between clean and dirty.

He pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.

						VENKMAN
			These aren't so bad yet.  You just hang them
			up for a while and they're fine.

												 CUT TO:
INT.  FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING

Janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.
Then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs.  She starts
primping and freshening up her makeup.

INT.  FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME

Louis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once
and for all.  He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.

						LOUIS
				 (to himself)
			Okay, Stinky, this is it.  Showdown time.
			You and me, pal.  You think you're smarter
			than I am?  We'll see about that.
				 (loud)
			Oh, hello, Pizza Man!  Oh, two larges!  I
			only ordered one.  Oh, pepperoni and
			pineapple.  My absolute favorite.  I guess
			I'll have to eat these both by myself.

THE CEILING

Slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging
upside down.

LOUIS

He spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.

						LOUIS
				 (quietly)
			Okay, let's boogie!

He whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a
gash across the ceiling.

THE STAIRS

Janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and
strikes the wall behind her.  Slimer disappears.

						LOUIS
				 (embarrassed and apologetic)
			Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do
			that.  It was an accident.

						JANINE
			What are you doing up here?

						LOUIS
			I was trying to get that smelly green thing.
			The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the
			fifth Ghostbuster.

						JANINE
			Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if
			you're already an accountant?

						LOUIS
			Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls
			in sick or gets hurt.

Louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.

						JANINE
			Have you made any plans yet?  You know
			tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

						LOUIS
			No, I celebrate at the beginning of my
			corporate tax year which is March first.
			That way I beat the crowds.

						JANINE
			That's very practical.  I hate going out on
			New Year's Eve, too.

There is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.

						JANINE
			Well, good night, Louis.

						LOUIS
				 (on an impulse)
			Janine, do you feel like maybe getting
			something to eat on the way home?

						JANINE
			I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd
			babysit.
				 (seductively)
			Do you want to babysit with me?

						LOUIS
			Oh, sure, that sounds great.

They exit.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

There is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it.  He's dressed
for the evening and looking very dapper.

INT.  VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing
there wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and
miners' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection
jars and photographic equipment.  They look like they're rigged out for a
major spelunking expedition.

						VENKMAN
				 (ushering them in)
			Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat
			barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?

						STANTZ
			We're going down into the sewer system to
			see if we can trace the source of the
			psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you
			might want to come along.

						VENKMAN
			Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going.
			I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

						SPENGLER
			You know, animals and lower life forms often
			anticipate major disasters.  Given the new
			magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous
			breeding surge in the cockroach population.

						VENKMAN
			Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.
				 (calls out)
			Dana?  The boys are going down under the
			sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon
			thinks there might even be some kind of big
			roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about
			dinner and go with them instead?

Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.

						STANTZ
			Wow.

Dana looks curiously at their outfits.

						DANA
			Hi.

They nod and wave back.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Ray and Egon)
			I think we're going to have to pass on the
			sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find
			out.

						STANTZ
				 (on his exit)
			Okay, but you're missing all the fun.

INT.  VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)

Stantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,
guided by a very old map of the underground city.

						STANTZ
			This is it.  Van Horne Station.  Right where
			the old transit map said it would be.

They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.

						STANTZ
			Let's get a sounding on the depth of that
			flow.

Stantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of
it attached to his utility belt.

						STANTZ
			Stand back.

He takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and
casts it out into the middle of the flow.  The plumb bob sinks and
Spengler reads the depth.

						SPENGLER
			Six feet -- seven -- eight --

						STANTZ
			That's it.  It's on the bottom.

						SPENGLER
			Nine feet -- ten --

						WINSTON
			Is the line sinking?

						SPENGLER
			No, the slime is rising.

Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the
platform and around his boots.

						STANTZ
				 (alarmed)
			Let's get out of here, boys.

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.

Spengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger
than all three of them.  As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and
closer to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his
belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt.  Spengler lets go in time
but Winston doesn't.  He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.
Stantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in
after him.

INT.  ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)

Dana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling
caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.

						VENKMAN
				 (very intimate)
			Here's to -- us.

She sighs and drinks.

						VENKMAN
			So -- are you making any New Year's
			resolutions?

						DANA
			I want to stop getting involved with men who
			aren't good for me.

						VENKMAN
			Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,
			or could you hold off for a few days maybe?

						DANA
			For one night in your life, do you think
			it's possible for us to be completely real?

						VENKMAN
			All right, you want to be real?  So tell me
			why did you dump me?

						DANA
			Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had
			to protect myself.  You really weren't very
			good for me, you know.

						VENKMAN
			I'm not even good for me.

						DANA
			Why do you say things like that?  You're so
			much better than you know.

						VENKMAN
			Thank you.  If I had that kind of support
			on a daily basis, I could definitely shape
			up by the turn of the century.

						DANA
				 (already feeling the
				 effects of the champagne)
			So why don't you give me a jingle in the
			year 2000?

						VENKMAN
			Let me jingle you right now.

He leans over to kiss her.

						DANA
			Maybe I should call Janine.

						VENKMAN
			Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way
			with children.

They kiss.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Janine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.

						JANINE
				 (looking around)
			I can't believe a person could actually live
			like this.

						LOUIS
				 (to the baby)
			So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in
			a small mining operation and then one day a
			beautiful princess came to live with them.

						JANINE
			It's really not a bad place.  It just needs
			a woman's touch.

						LOUIS
				 (continuing)
			So they bartered room and board in exchange
			for housekeeping services, which was a good
			deal for all of them because then they didn't
			have to withhold tax and social security,
			which I'm not saying is right but it's just
			a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can
			finish this later if you're tired.

Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.

						JANINE
			You're really good with children, Louis.  I
			can tell.
				 (as he returns)
			Why don't you come here and sit with me?

						LOUIS
			Okay.

He sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.

						JANINE
				 (getting close)
			Motherhood is a very natural instinct for
			me.  I'd like to have a baby myself.
			Wouldn't you?

						LOUIS
				 (gulps)
			Tonight?

EXT.  STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below.  It slides away,
and Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.
They are exhausted and covered with slime.

						WINSTON
				 (uncharacteristically
				 angry)
			Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to
			do -- drown me?

						STANTZ
				 (unusually mean)
			Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were
			too stupid to drop that line.

						WINSTON
				 (shoves him)
			You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll
			punch your lights out.

						STANTZ
			Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead
			and try it.

Spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.

						SPENGLER
			If you two are looking for a fight, you got
			one.
				 (putting up his fists)
			Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me,
			sucker.

						STANTZ
				 (squaring off)
			Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had
			it with you.

They grab each other and start to tussle.  Suddenly Spengler comes to his
senses and pulls them apart.

						SPENGLER
				 (forcefully)
			Strip!  Right now!  Get out of those clothes!

He starts yanking off his slicker and waders.  Bewildered, Stantz and
Winston start doing the same.  Spengler helps pull off their clothes and
throws them into the open manhole.  Now wearing only long underwear, they
seem to return to normal.

						WINSTON
			What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill
			you.

						STANTZ
			Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff
			is like pure, concentrated evil.

Stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the
museum.

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing right to this spot.

Stantz looks around and spots Venkman.

						STANTZ
			That's all right, I see him.

They blow right by the Maitre d' who jumps back in horror as they pass.

VENKMAN

He's just about to pour more champagne when he sees Ray, Egon and Winston
coming toward him through the restaurant.

						STANTZ
				 (very excited)
			You should've been there, Venkman.
			Absolutely incredible!

						VENKMAN
			Yeah, sorry I missed it.
				 (noting their attire)
			I guess you guys didn't know about the dress
			code here.  It's really kind of a coat and
			tie place.

						STANTZ
			It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under
			it actually.

						WINSTON
			Rivers of the stuff!

						SPENGLER
			And it's all flowing toward the museum.

He gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and
lands on a well-dressed diner.

						STANTZ
				 (calls out)
			Sorry!

						DANA
			Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.

Venkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues
aside.

						VENKMAN
				 (confidentially)
			Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights.
			Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?

						SPENGLER
				 (to Venkman)
			This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.
			It's hot and it's ready to pop.

MAITRE D'

He hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and
makes straight for Venkman's table.

						MAITRE D'
			Arrest these men.

						COP
				 (recognizing them)
			Hey!  It's the Ghostbusters.  You're out of
			uniform, gentlemen

Stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look.

						STANTZ
				 (self-conscious)
			Uh -- well -- we had a little accident, but
			forget that.  We have to see the mayor as
			soon as possible.

						COP
			Look, Doc, why don't you just go home.
			You'll get a good night's sleep and then you
			can give the mayor a call in the morning.
			Come on.

He takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.

						STANTZ
			We're not going anywhere with you.  I told
			you we have to see the mayor now.

						COP
				 (grabbing Stantz)
			I'm warning you.  You can come along
			peaceably or --

						VENKMAN
				 (grabs the Cop)
			Hey, don't be an idiot.  This is serious.

						COP
				 (angry)
			Look, pal, keep this up and you're going
			with them.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, yeah?

						COP
				 (has had enough)
			Yeah, let's go.  You're all under arrest.

The Cop catches Venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the

			Finish your dessert -- it's already paid

They all exit, causing a major commotion among the other diners.

			Look, we're not drunk and we're not crazy.
			This is a matter of vital importance.

Venkman steps in and looks at the policemen's nametags.

						COP
			What are you doing?

Dana frowns.

INT.  GRACIE MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are
ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors.  The

front of the fireplace in his well-appointed private study, flanked by
Jack Hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes.  The Ghostbusters enter.

INT.  STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The Mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of

			All right -- the Ghostbusters.  I'll tell

			You've got two minutes.  Make it good.

			You get enough negative energy flowing in a

						WINSTON
			Tell him about the toaster.

						VENKMAN
			I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

						MAYOR
				 (shaking his head)
			Being miserable and treating other people
			like dirt is every New Yorker's God-given
			right.  What am I supposed to do -- go on

			they have to be nice to each other?  I'm
			sorry, none of this makes any sense to me,

The mayor exits, leaving the Ghostbusters to Hardemeyer.

						HARDEMEYER

			That's quite a story.

			Yeah, I think the Times might be interested,

A sweet, kindly-looking English nanny appears, pushing a pram, strolling

She picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram, then turns and
smiles at Dana.  The smile turns to a hideous grin, then the nanny
shrieks at Dana and takes off like a shot with the baby.

DANA

She watches the creature fly off with Oscar, then climbs back through
the window assisted by Louis and Janine.

						DANA
				 (resolutely)
			Louis, you have to find Peter and tell him
			what happened.

						LOUIS
				 (confused and worried)
			Where're you going?

						DANA
			To get my baby back.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER)

A taxi pulls up, Dana jumps out and rushes into the museum.  The moment
the door closes behind her, there is a loud THUNDERCLAP, the ground
trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of
the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the
building.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  PARKVIEW PSYCHIATRIC - PADDED ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Venkman, Stantz, Spengler and Winston are in a padded cell.  They are
handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their
waists.  Venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall
while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical
Psychiatrist.

						STANTZ
			We think the spirit of Vigo the Carpathian
			is alive in a painting at the Manhattan
			Museum.

						PSYCHIATRIST
			I see. And are there any other paintings in
			the museum with bad spirits in them?

						SPENGLER
				 (impatient)
			You're wasting valuable time!  We have reason
			to believe that Vigo is drawing strength from
			a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been
			collecting under the city.

						PSYCHIATRIST
			Yes, tell me about the slime.

						WINSTON
			It's potent stuff.  We made a toaster dance
			with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his
			friend's baby.

The psychiatrist looks at Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			Don't look at me.  I think they're nuts.

												 CUT TO:

INT.  MUSEUM RESTORATION STUDIO - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in
eerie white light.  Oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the
painting of Vigo.  Dana enters cautiously and sees the baby.  Seeing no
one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the
baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and
intact.

						JANOSZ (O.S.)
			I knew you would come.

Startled, Dana turns at the sound of his voice as Janosz steps out from
behind the Vigo painting.

						DANA
				 (defiantly)
			What do you want with my baby?

						JANOSZ
			No harm will come to the child.  You might
			even say it's a privilege.  He will be the
			vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you --
			well, you will be the mother of the ruler
			of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?

						DANA
			If this is what the world will be like, I
			don't want to live in it.

						JANOSZ
				 (confidentially, indicating
				 Vigo)
			I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.

						DANA
			Everybody has a choice.

						JANOSZ
			Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look.
			That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there.
			He's Vigo!

						DANA
			I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my
			baby.

Dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly Oscar flies out of her arms,
floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.

DANA

She turns and looks at Vigo, for the first time feeling his power.

						JANOSZ
			You will see.  It's all for the best.

The Ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom, a dingy lounge for patients
in the locked ward.  There is a television set, a Ping-Pong table and a
few tables and chairs.  Stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy
wire mesh covering the windows.

						STANTZ
			This is it. boys.  It's starting.  Shit-storm
			2000.

Venkman is doing occupational therapy, weaving on a little hand-loom.

						VENKMAN
			It better not start yet.  I'm trying to
			finish my potholder before lunch.

						WINSTON
			You think all those predictions about the

A PATIENT at the next table joins the discussion.

				 (with certainty)
			1997.  My dog told me.

						VENKMAN

						LOUIS
			Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this
			for me.  I'm begging you.

						SHERMAN
			I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I
			could lose my license.

						LOUIS
			Why can't you just have them released?
			You're a doctor.

						SHERMAN
			I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders
			on the psych ward.

						LOUIS
			Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.

						SHERMAN
			Like what?

						LOUIS
			I got you out of those bad tax shelters.

						SHERMAN
			You were the one who got me in.

						LOUIS
			I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she
			put out, didn't she?

						SHERMAN
			Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion
			for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get
			in a lot of trouble.

						LOUIS
			I'm telling you, we're all going to be in
			big trouble if we don't do something fast.
			That ghost guy came and took my friend's
			baby and we got to get it back.  It's just

						SHERMAN
			Then you should go to the police.  I don't

Sherman looks out the window.

EXT.  SKY - SHERMAN'S POV

The sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed.

With the Plaza Hotel in the background, the fountain starts to spout
psycho-reactive slime.

HOTEL ENTRANCE

A well-heeled MAN and WOMAN step out of a limousine and walk up the steps
toward the revolving door.  She looks up at the sky and frowns.

						WOMAN
				 (shrewish)
			I told you we should have stayed in Palm
			Beach.  The weather here gets stranger every
			year.

						MAN
			Yes, dear.

She doesn't notice it, but a small amount of slime falls on the back of
her luxurious, full-length, white mink coat.  The doorman nods
courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs.

WOMAN

She yelps in pain.

						WOMAN
				 (to the doorman)
			Something just bit me!

The doorman looks curiously at her, then recoils in shock as her coat
comes alive.  MINK HEADS pop out of the thick fur, SNARLING, BARKING and
YAPPING, their sharp, little teeth biting the air.  Reacting quickly, the
doorman yanks the coat off the woman's back, throws it to the ground and
starts stomping on it as the Woman and her husband look on in horror.
The coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street.

						LIEUTENANT
				 (on another call)
			What is it?  I'm talkin' here!

EXT.  PIER 34 - THEIR POV - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)

The name "R.M.S. Titanic" is clearly visible on the side of the huge

			Oh, I pulled a few strings.  I wouldn't want

Louis winks conspiratorially at Sherman.

			This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello

				 (sotto voce to Stantz)
			I promised him a ride in the car if he got

While he's talking, the Ghostbusters jump in the Ectomobile and drive
off, leaving him and Louis standing at the curb.

						LOUIS
			Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.

EXT.  MUSEUM - NIGHT (ECLIPSE)(LATER)

ECTO-2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum.  Hundreds of
spectators are already there gawking at the building as the Ghostbusters
jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.

EXT.  MUSEUM THEIR POV - BUILDING

The building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho-reactive slime.
CITY WORKMEN and FIREMEN are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches,
jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make
a dent.

GHOSTBUSTERS

They size up the situation as they don their proton packs.

						STANTZ
			It looks like a giant Jello mold.

						VENKMAN
			I hate Jello.

They stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to
the museum.

						STANTZ
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Okay, give it a rest, Captain.  We'll take
			it from here.

						FIRE CAPTAIN
				 (skeptical)
			Be my guest.  We been cutting here for three
			hours.  What the hell's going on?  You know
			the Titanic arrived this morning?

						VENKMAN
			Well, better late than never.

The workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the
Ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.

						SPENGLER
				 (monitoring valences)
			Full neutronas, maser assist.

They adjust their settings and prepare to fire.

						STANTZ
			Throw 'em!

They trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building
with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.

						VENKMAN
				 (to the firemen)
			Okay, who knows "Cumbaya?"

A few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands.  Venkman
grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.

						VENKMAN
			All right.  Nice and sweet --
				 (starts singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya --

Stantz, Spengler, Winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding
hands and swaying to the music.

						ALL
				 (singing)
			Cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, Cumbaya, milord,
			cumbaya, Oh, Lord, cumbaya.

Stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra-goggles and finds that
they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.

						STANTZ
			Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't
			get through this stuff.

						VENKMAN
			Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say
			supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

						SPENGLER
			It won't work.  There's no way we could
			generate enough positive energy to crack
			that shell.

						STANTZ
			I can't believe things have gotten so bad
			in this city that there's no way back.
			Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy.
			And there are too many people who'd just as
			soon step on your face as look at you.  But
			there've got to be a few sparks of sweet
			humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We
			just have to mobilize it.

						SPENGLER
			We need something that everyone can get
			behind, a symbol --

His eyes fall on ECTO-2's New York State license plate which features a
line drawing of the Statue of Liberty.

						STANTZ
				 (he sees it, too)
			Something that appeals to the best in each
			and every one of us --

						SPENGLER
			Something good --

						VENKMAN
			And pure --

						WINSTON
			And decent.

EXT.  THE STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

There is a commotion among the crowd as the Mayor's limousine arrives
with a police escort.  Jack Hardemeyer steps out followed by the Mayor
himself and they cross to the museum entrance.

Hardemeyer, his ASSISTANT and several police BODYGUARDS confront the
Ghostbusters.

						HARDEMEYER
			Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff
			together, get back in that clown car and get
			out of here.  This is a city matter and
			everything's under control.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for
			you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law
			in there and he's got my girlfriend and her
			kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when
			you're partying uptown, this guy's going to
			come to life and start doing amateur head
			transplants.  And that's just round one.

						MAYOR
			Are you telling me there're people trapped
			in there?

						HARDEMEYER
				 (to his assistant)
			This is dynamite.  Call A.P., U.P.I., and
			C.N.N. and get them down here right away.
			When the police bring this kid out I want
			them to hand it right to the mayor and I
			want it all on camera.

						STANTZ
			Mr. Mayor, if we don't do something by
			midnight, you're going to go down in history
			as the man who let New York get sucked down
			into the tenth level of hell.

The Mayor stops to consider the situation.

						MAYOR
				 (to the Fire Captain)
			Can you get into that museum?

						FIRE CAPTAIN
			If I had a nuclear warhead, maybe.

The Mayor turns to Venkman.

						MAYOR
			You know why all these things are happening?

						VENKMAN
			We tried to tell you last night, but Mr.
			Hard-On over here packed us off to the loony
			bin.

Hardemeyer flips out.

						HARDEMEYER
			This is preposterous!  You can't seriously
			believe all this mumbo-jumbo!  It's the
			Twentieth Century, for crying out loud!
				 (viciously, to Venkman)
			Look, mister, I don't know what this stuff
			is or how you got it all over the museum,
			but you better get it off and I mean right
			now!

He pounds the wall of slime with his fist, and they all watch in
amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily
through the slime curtain.  Only his shoes can be seen, embedded in the
slime.

						MAYOR
				 (to Venkman)
			Okay, just tell me what you need.

EXT.  LIBERTY ISLAND (NEW YORK HARBOR) - NIGHT

With the city skyline in the b.g., the Ghostbusters prepare their
equipment.  Each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks,
hoses, nozzles and an abundance of gauges, valves and regulators.
Venkman looks up at the Statue of Liberty looming above them.

						VENKMAN
			Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

						WINSTON
			Wonder what?

						VENKMAN
			If she's naked under that toga.  She's
			French, you know.

						SPENGLER
			There's nothing under that toga but 300 tons
			of iron and steel.

Stantz is looking worried.

			Only one way to find out.

They enter the statue.

INT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - MOMENTS LATER

The Ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals
straight up 100 feet inside the hollow super-structure of the statue.
Spengler and Winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to
various relays on the interior surface of the statue.  Venkman and Stantz
are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase.
They finish the installation, then Stantz dons one of the new backpacks
and gives the order.

						STANTZ
			Okay, boys.  Let's frost it.

They begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho-reactive
slime.

						LOUIS
			Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really
			not much to do here and they might need
			some back-up at the museum.

						JANINE
			You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.

She kisses Louis and he gets extremely self-conscious.

						LOUIS
			Uh -- oh -- well, I better hurry.

He rushes out.

statue.

STANTZ

He plugs the main cable lead into a transformer.

						STANTZ
			It's all yours, Pete.
				 (checks his watch)
			There's not much time left.

Venkman plugs the speaker cable into a Walkman and gives a downbeat.

						VENKMAN

			Okay, one, two, three, four --

He hits "Play" on the Walkman and "HIGHER AND HIGHER" BOOMS from the huge
SPEAKERS, amplified by the statue's vast hollow interior.

INT.  OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

The head of the statue lurches suddenly, but the Ghostbusters cling to
the rail and manage to keep their feet.

Stantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and

Stantz studies a maritime navigational chart.

With that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from
head to toe, blowing him into the corner.  Then they turn to Vigo.

VIGO

He is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the
knees down.  He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash
his magic powers.

THE GHOSTBUSTERS

They stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been
neutralized by the good will of the people.

						STANTZ
			Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad
			little monkey.

						VENKMAN
			The whole city's together on this one.  We
			took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you
			know.

						WINSTON
				 (arming his slime-blower)
			Say goodnight now.

Suddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.

						SPENGLER
			Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!

						STANTZ
				 (strangling)
			Do it!  Just do it!

Winston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray.

VIGO

He bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting.

INT.  MUSEUM - PAINTING - NIGHT

The paint turns liquid, melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor
revealing another painting underneath it.

INT.  MUSEUM - GHOSTBUSTERS - NIGHT (AFTER BATTLE)

Venkman, Spengler and Winston rush over to Ray and kneel beside him.  He
is completely covered with slime and motionless.

						SPENGLER
				 (examining him)
			He's breathing.

Winston wipes the slime off Ray's face and Ray opens his eyes.

						WINSTON
			Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?

						STANTZ
				 (smiles lovingly)
			Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.

						VENKMAN
			Oh, no.  We've got to live with this?

They pull him to his feet.

						STANTZ
			I love you guys.  You're the best friends
			I've ever had.

He hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well.  Venkman recoils
in disgust.

						VENKMAN
			Hey, I just had this suit cleaned.
				 (indicating Janosz)
			Take care of the wiggler, will you.

Venkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby.  She hugs Venkman.

						VENKMAN
			What is this -- a love in?
				 (notes the symbols painted
				 on the baby's body)
			Hey, sailor.  I think the tattoos are a
			little much, don't you?

He picks up the baby.

						DANA
				 (to Venkman)
			I think he likes you.  I think I do too.

						VENKMAN
			Finally came to your senses, huh?

They hug and kiss.

SPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ

They help Janosz to his feet.  He's dazed but unhurt.

						JANOSZ
				 (restored to normalcy)
			What happened?

						STANTZ
				 (calmly)
			Sir, you had a violent, prolonged,
			transformative psychic episode.  But it's
			over now.  Want a coffee?

						JANOSZ
				 (extremely nice)
			That's very kind of you.

						SPENGLER
				 (to Stantz)
			He's fine, Ray.  Physically intact,
			psychomagnetherically neutral.

						JANOSZ
			Is that good?

						WINSTON
			It's where you want to be.

As they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by
Vigo's self-portrait.

						SPENGLER
			Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or
			Brunelleschi.

						WINSTON
				 (staring at it)
			There's something very familiar about this
			painting.

INT.  MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT

It's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four
archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby.  One holds a harp,
one, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword.  Most
remarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,
Spengler and Winston.

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

A city bus pulls up near the museum and Louis steps off.  He waves his
thanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.

						LOUIS
				 (to Slimer)
			Okay, so Monday night we'll get something
			to eat and maybe go bowling?  Can you bowl
			with those little arms?

SLIMER GRUNTS and SLOBBERS a reply, flexing his scrawny biceps.

						LOUIS
			Okay, I have to go save Dana.  I'll see you
			later.

												 CUT TO:

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT (LITTLE LATER)

The Ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come
out the main entrance with Dana and the baby.  Everybody starts singing
"Auld Lang Syne."  Louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and
finds the Ghostbusters.

						LOUIS
			Am I too late?

						STANTZ
			No, you're right on time.

Stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him.

EXT.  MUSEUM ENTRANCE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime.  He looks at the
celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears.

						HARDEMEYER
				 (weepy)
			Happy New Year, everybody!

He joins in on "Auld Lang Syne."

												 CUT TO:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)

The Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind
the museum, her toga up over her knees.  The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.
The Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.

						VENKMAN
			She's all right.  She's just sleeping it off.

						MAYOR
				 (stricken)
			We just had it restored.

						VENKMAN
			This probably isn't a good time to bring
			this up, but the last time we did a job for
			the city you stiffed us.

						STANTZ
				 (handing the Mayor an
				 invoice)
			This is a bill for tonight's job.

The Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.

						MAYOR
			What!  This is way too much.
				 (hands the bill back to
				 Venkman)
			We won't pay.

Venkman looks at the Statue.

						VENKMAN
				 (to Stantz)
			I think she looks pretty good here, don't
			you?

						STANTZ
			Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

Realizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.

				MAYOR
		All right, all right.  If you can wait until
		Monday I'll issue you a check.

				SPENGLER
		Sorry.  No checks.  Company policy.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY (WEEKS LATER)

The sun is shining brightly and Liberty is back on her pedestal where she
belongs.  The Mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return.
The Ghostbusters, Dana, Janine and Louis are there as honored guests.

				VENKMAN
			(looking up at the statue)
		Pretty impressive, huh?

				SPENGLER
			(musing)
		It's probably the first thing my
		grandparents saw when they came to this
		country.

				VENKMAN
		From where -- Neptune?

				SPENGLER
		They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.

				VENKMAN
		Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.

				STANTZ
			(in a similarly reflective
			mood)
		My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still
		have the pictures they took of the statue
		from the boat when they arrived.

				VENKMAN
		Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to
		America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I
		recall.  How about you, Winston?

						WINSTON
			My people weren't taking any pictures from
			those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't
			any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome
			them, either.  What are you, Dana?

						VENKMAN
			Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here
			since the year 12.

						DANA
			That's not true.  It was 1620.

						VENKMAN
			Same difference.

						STANTZ
			What's your story, Pete?

						VENKMAN
			Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish,
			some German, some French, Dutch -- the women
			in my family slept around.  And that's what
			made this country great.

						DANA
			That's a terrible thing to say.

						VENKMAN
			So what?  It's a free country.
				 (looking up at the Statue)
			Thanks, Lib.

They all look up at the Statue.

EXT.  STATUE OF LIBERTY - HEAD OF STATUE - DAY

Slimer flies out one of the observation windows, THEME MUSIC KICKS IN and
the CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY FROM the island TO a HIGH SHOT of the
Statue, lower Manhattan and the shining sea beyond.

											FADE OUT.

                                               First Draft 2/19/96





     FADE IN:

     An iguana...

     Crawling off its nest, leaving its eggs exposed.


  1  EXT. MORUROA ATOLL ISLANDS, FRENCH POLYNESIA - PACIFIC       1

     Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary
     footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick
     shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons
     all in their natural tropical environment.

     Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June
     1968

     Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a
     static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down
     in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the
     island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
     move about.

     Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
     nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.

     We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
     over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
     French government held in this tropical region.

     Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
     building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
     culminating in one final EXPLOSION.

     The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
     fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
     below.

     We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
     unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
     lizard's eggs.

     Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
     clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the
     eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE
     continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

                                             SMASH CUT TO:


  2  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT          2

     Smashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm
     we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker.

     Super: Pacific Ocean, present day


  3  INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT                             3

     We TRACK across the complicated computerized
     navigational console that is actually steering the
     immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.
     program playing.

     At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an
     overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
     satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.

     Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,
     the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
     the console.

     The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly
     toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a
     KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the
     radio/intercom.

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               Captain. This is the bridge. We have
               an emergency.


  4  INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT                   4

     Alarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters
     and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper
     decks.


  5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5

     The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the
     kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by.

                            COOK
                      (in Japanese)
               What's going on? What's happening?

     Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an
     enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense
     ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY.

     The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up
     nervously.


  6  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   6

     The CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the
     console.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               What was that!?

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               I can't tell...

     Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is
     HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain
     and Skipper to the floor.

     Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of
     our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in
     the Captain's eyes at the sound.


  7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7

     The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the
     horrible WAILING SOUND.

     Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something
     enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew
     members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.

     Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly
     filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the
     crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases
     them.


  8  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   8

     The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights
     and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls
     in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
               lifeboats...

     But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS
     across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE
     GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.


  9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9

     The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out
     onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it
     violently.


     A TARP

     is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life
     boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
     tries to hoist them up and over the side.


     ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER

     Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the
     ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
     it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING
     INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.
     Could that have been a CLAW?


     THE CREW

     Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,
     several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against
     the ship.


     THE CLAW

     Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time
     the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.


     A LIFEBOAT

     Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following
     it is the Cook.

     Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing
     to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES
     something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets
     go of the railing.

     The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
     FLIPS OVER.

                                             CUT TO:


     WINDSHIELD WIPERS

     Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain
     doused windshield, DR. NIKO "NICK" TATOPOULOS. Music
     blares from the tiny headphones of his Walkman.

                            NICK
                      (singing)
               ...I'm singing in the rain, just
               singing in the rain...

                                             CUT TO:


 10  INT. RUSSIAN TOWN - RAIN - DAY                              10

     The utility van races through this small Russian town
     right past a roadblock marked with the international
     signs for "no trespass" and "nuclear radiation."

                            NICK
               ..."What a glorious feeling. I'm happy
               again..."

     As the van disappears down the road, we CRANE UP
     revealing a city sign reading: CHERNOBYL, RUSSIA.


 11  EXT. CHERNOBYL DIRT PARK - RAIN - DAY                       11

     With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
     distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
     field of dirt.

     Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van.
     He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
     cases.

     Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the
     cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an
     assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.

     Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll
     meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young
     and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily
     together.

     With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
     life. Inside one of the cases are several cables
     attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up
               above..."

     Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to
     SHOVE the spikes into the muddy earth.

                            NICK
               ..."The sun's in my heart and I'm
               ready for love..."

     Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the
     van and pops the hood.


     CLOSE - VAN'S ENGINE

     We SEE the steaming engine and a large electric car
     BATTERY.

                            NICK
               ..."Let the cloudy skies chase..."

     He attaches the cables to the battery and they SPARK!
     Nick YELPS and jumps back. Shaking off the shock, he
     rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his
     knees.

     Suddenly, raising from the mud we see DOZENS OF
     EARTHWORMS. Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
     jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in
     his element.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm singin' in the mud, just
               scooping up my worms..."

     Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an
     enormous RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTER lands right behind
     him.

     From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter,
     Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several RUSSIAN
     OFFICERS coming toward him. Nick scrambles to his feet.

                            NICK
                      (broken Russian)
               Good day. I am here with
               permission...I have a, a...
                      (in English)
               Permit. How do you say permit?

     He goes through his pockets looking for his permits.

                            MALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Dr. Nick Topopolosis?

     Tatopoulos looks up as the Russian soldiers move past
     him and over towards his cases of equipment. A man in a
     long raincoat comes forward.

                            NICK
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            TERRINGTON
               The worm guy, right?
                      (extending his hand as he
                      approaches)
               Kyle Terrington, U.S. State
               Department.

     The Russian soldiers close up his equipment and take it
     off to the Helicopter.

                            NICK
               What are they doing?

                            TERRINGTON
               You've been reassigned.

                            NICK
               You can't shut me down now! My
               research here's not finished!

                            TERRINGTON
               It is now.

                                             CUT TO:


 12  EXT. PAPEETE - TAHITI - STREET - DAY                        12

     Coastal town of Papeete, Tahiti. With the ocean in the
     distance, through the heat waves we SEE a row of
     official looking black sedans coming toward us.


 13  EXT. PAPEETE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                    13

     The doors to the sedans open as a group of very official
     looking Government types. Stopping to light his
     cigarette is PHILLIP RAYMOND, 40's, intense, dangerous
     and worst of all...French.


 14  INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                 14

     Raymond leads the official looking group down the hall.
     A BRIEFING OFFICER rushes over. (The following dialog is
     entirely in French with subtitles)

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               The Japanese consulate has been
               calling and we've been getting
               pressure from the Americans.

                            RAYMOND
               What did you tell them?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Nothing yet.

                            RAYMOND
               Are there any other survivors?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Only one, Sir. He was very lucky.

     The group arrives at a door at the end of the hall. The
     Briefing Officer opens the door.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR

     In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from
     the tanker curled up in the fetal position. The doctors
     and a few nurses are attending to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Get them out of there.

     Two of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and
     Nurses out of the room. Raymond nods to two other
     Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment,
     including a video camera.


 15  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                   15

     Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling
     down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The
     old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back
     and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes
     forward.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in French)
               Ask him what happened.

     The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old
     Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook
     seems to be in a world of his own.

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
                      (in English)
               It's no use. He's been like this since
               we fished him out of the ocean.
               Whatever happened to that tanker put
               him in a complete state of shock.

     Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high.
     The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed
     by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old
     Cook's face.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in English)
               What did you see, old man?

     Drawn out of himself by the flame...

                            OLD COOK
                      (weakly)
               Gojira...Gojira...

     Raymond shoots a look at the Second Official for an
     explanation.

                            SECOND OFFICIAL
                      (in English)
               I have no idea what he is saying.

                            OLD COOK
                      (stronger)
               ...Gojira!...Gojira!...GOJIRA!!

 16  EXT. GULF OF DEN SAN MIGUEL, PANAMA - DAY                   16

     A small sea plane flies over this jungle region of
     Panama, darting up the Gulf into the lush greenery of
     the countryside.

     Super: Guilfo de San Miguel, Panama - 45 km outside
     of La Paz

     Slowly the plane begins to descend, landing by a small
     village.


 17  EXT. VILLAGE FISHING DOCK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY             17

     Several soldiers unload Nick's cargo as he steps out of
     the plane onto the dock. As he walks towards shore he
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - POLICE BARRICADE

     Dozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at
     a police barricade; their access to the village denied.
     Panamanian Police and U.S. military working together to
     keep people out.

     Marching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS,
     30's, efficient, who is spearheading this operation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Dr. Niko Topopolosis?

                            NICK
                      (correcting)
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Right. The worm guy.
                      (to guards at blockade)
               Can someone get those people off the
               beach?

                            NICK
               Excuse me, would you mind telling me
               what the hell I'm doing here?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Follow me.

     The Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds.

                            NICK
               You didn't answer my question. In
               fact, for the last 18 hours no one has
               answered any of my questions.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We have a situation on our hands that
               requires your particular expertise.


     ANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT

     Several soldiers and researchers are investigating the
     site when Nick and the Major walk past.

                            NICK
               Look, I may work for the Nuclear
               Regulatory Commission but accidents
               and spills are not my field.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We know.

     Major Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade
     away from a jungle pathway. Major Hicks takes the
     pathway.

                            NICK
               Do you know that you just interrupted
               a three year study of the Chernobyl
               earthworm?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Yeah, you're the worm guy.

                            NICK
               The radioactive contamination in that
               area altered the earthworm's DNA! You
               have any idea what that means?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               No, but I have the feeling I'm about
               to find out.

                            NICK
               It means that due to a man made
               accident the Chernobyl earthworms are
               now over seventeen percent larger than
               they were before. Mutated by seventeen
               percent?

     Major Hicks stops, turns to Nick.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (bemused)
               Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.

                            NICK
               They're enormous! A new species
               created by man's recklessness. That's
               what I've been trying to tell you, I'm
               only a biologist. I take radioactive
               samples and study them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then you're perfect.
                      (pointing to the ground)
               Here's your radioactive sample. Study
               it.

     With that Major Hicks walks away.

                            NICK
               What sample?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're standing on it.

     Nick looks down, sees nothing.

                            NICK
               I don't see it.
                      (no response)
               Where is it?

     We CRANE UP above him, pulling back farther and farther,
     until we SEE he's standing inside of a 15 YARD LONG
     GIGANTIC FOOTPRINT in the sand.

                            NICK (CONT'D)
               I don't see it!

     Two scientists have spread out a tape measure to
     document its length as two others inspect it with Geiger
     counters. Nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a
     remarkable discovery. He looks up ahead and SEES...


     OVERHEAD TITLT SHOT - Foot steps...-

     Five gigantic footsteps in front of him. Other
     researchers examining the prints with all kinds of
     equipment. Geiger counters, CLICK, CLICKING away. Nick
     is stunned.


18   EXT. TATTERED VILLAGE REMAINS - MOMENTS LATER               18

     Nick rushes to catch up with Major Hicks who walks
     towards a command tent in the distance.

                            NICK
                      (flabbergasted)
               That was a footprint. I was standing
               inside a footprint.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's right.

                            NICK
               But there's no animal in the world
               that can make prints like that? Is
               there?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're hoping you're going to help us
               figure that out.

     The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being
     attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined
     for radiation. The village has been decimated.

                            NICK
               Somebody must have seen it.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               It happened so fast no one knew what
               hit them 'til is was over.

     A jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes
     rushing over with a video tape in his hands. As he passes
     Major Hicks...

                            PETERS
                      (on the run)
               Tape's in. The French finally released
               it.

     Peters takes off for the command' tent. Nick and the
     Major follow.


     COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Part military, part scientific command post. Lots of
     activity. Peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a
     television. Major Hicks and Nick follow.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               A tanker was attacked and sunk
               yesterday near the French Polynesians.
               We think there's a connection.

                            WOMAN SCIENTIST (ELSIE)
               Is that the tape of the witness?

     Excitedly, ELSIE CHAPMAN, heavy set, early 30's,
     paleontologist and head of the research team, leads
     several of her colleagues over to the t.v.

                            NICK
               Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...

                            ELSIE
               Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

     She's clearly attracted to him. This doesn't escape
     Nick, who's not too comfortable with her flirtatious
     glare. She turns to a scientist standing next to her,
     DR. CLIVE CRAVEN.

                            ELSIE (CONT'D)
               Dr. Craven, have you met the worm
               guy?

                            DR. CRAVEN
               Nice to meet you.

     The t.v. turns on and we SEE the old Cook, rocking on
     his bed, repeating over and over the same word...

                            OLD COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...Gojira...

     This is all too overwhelming for him. He turns from the
     t.v. and looks out into the jungle.

     Slowly he walks away, staring at something in the
     distance with total awe. Elsie walks up next to him.

                            ELSIE
               What could have possibly done all
               that?

     We REVERSE ANGLE and SEE what they are staring at.

     A gigantic path cut through the jungle.

     Something of immense size has trampled and cut a deep
     and wide path right through the jungle forest that goes
     on for miles on end. Over the stunned face of Nick we
     HEAR...

                            OLD COOK (O.S.)

     As we WIDEN we see this is one of several wall mounted
     monitors all showing channel WNEW. Through the glass
     doorway nearby we see CHARLES CAIMAN, 40's, handsome,
     entering the office.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Murray wants these copied to each

     ANGLE - SECRETARY DESK

     Standing in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early
     thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't
     toughened in the big city and talking with her
     co-worker, LUCY, sitting.

                            AUDREY
               And I'm supposed to remind you to call
               him on all of Caiman's expense
               p.o.'s.

                            LUCY
               Speak of the devil.

     Just then Caiman passes behind them.

                            AUDREY
                      (nervous)
               Think I should ask him? I'm going to
               ask him. You think I should? I will.

     Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman. Lucy
     rolls her eyes.

                            LUCY
               Oh girl...


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him.
     Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He
     can't.

                            AUDREY
               Did you talk with Humphries?

                            CAIMAN
               This is not the place...

                            AUDREY
               Just tell me, did you talk with him?

                            CAIMAN
               He said he'd consider it. It's between
               you and Rodriguez.

                            AUDREY
               Are you serious? He's going to
               consider me for he job? What else did
               he say?

     They arrive at his office. An enormous standee of
     himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there.

                            CAIMAN
               Why don't I tell you over dinner
               tonight? Your place.

     He stops at his door. Audrey is startled.

                            AUDREY
               Mr. Caiman, you're married.

                            CAIMAN
               And you're beautiful...

                      (stubbornly)
               Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra
               research for you after hours and
               weekends for nearly a year. And I've
               never asked for anything but this job
               is really important to me. I'm too old
               to be an assistant anymore. I need to
               know this job is going someplace.

                            CAIMAN
               So have dinner with me tonight.

                            AUDREY
               I can't.

                            CAIMAN
               It's your choice.

     Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to
     face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her
     chewing gum and plasters it on his nose.

 21  INT. JEEP - SAME                                            21

     Elsie, Nick and Clive are cramped together along with
     Nick's equipment in the back of the jeep. Nick looks
     very uncomfortable. Elsie looks at Nick...lasciviously.

                            ELSIE
               Three years digging up worms in
               Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos

               Oh, I'm not married.

                            ELSIE
               Really? A girlfriend then?

                            NICK
               No. Perhaps I work too much.

     Nick seems to get lost in thought.

                            NICK
               Not for a long time, now.

                            ELSIE
               Well, I think you're cute.

                            NICK
                      (awkward)
               Oh, thank you.
                      (whispered to Clive)
               Is she always like this?

                            CLIVE
                      (conspiratorially)
               I had to beat her off with a stick.

     The sound of a HELICOPTER ZOOMS overhead.


     AERIAL SHOT - HELICOPTER - SAME - DAY

     A helicopter ZOOMS past our convoy. As we FOLLOW the
     helicopter we REVEAL...


     JAMAICAN BEACH WITH A BEACHED CARGO SHIP - DAY

     Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo
     ship lays on its side in the sand. Two gigantic holes,
     ripped into its hull.


     MILITARY JEEPS

     Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push
     past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a
     collective gasp as they see the ship for the first
     time.

     Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital)
     take measurements of the holes in the ship.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Who are they? Lieutenant, get those
               people away from there.

                            RAYMOND
                      (French accent)
               They are with me!

     Everyone in the group turns to find Mr. Phillip
     Raymond.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               And who are you?

     Raymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his
     business card.

                            RAYMOND
               CHARGEURES, property and casualty
               insurance. We are preparing a report.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're fast.

                            RAYMOND
               That is our job.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Well your people are getting in the
               way of my job.

                            RAYMOND
               Major, what do you think could have
               done this?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Get your people out of there or I
               will.

     The Major walks away. Raymond studies him as he does.


     ANGLE - SHIP

     Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the
     hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking
     radiation counts of the ship.

                            NICK
               Mind if I borrow this?

     Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the
     cracked hull of the ship.


 22  INT. CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                          22

     Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship
     are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets
     readings from all over the area. One particular spot,
     above him, seems slightly stronger.

     Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and
     puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like
     the ones from Chernobyl)

     Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp
     shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF
     REPTILE FLESH.

     He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it
     into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half,
     SOMETHING GIVES WAY.

     With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of
     water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front
     of him.

     Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body
     swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.

     The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all
     right.

                            PETERS
               You okay, Nick?

                            NICK
               Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...

     Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar
     is suddenly handed to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Are you looking for this?

                            NICK
               Thanks.

     Raymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     UNDERWATER - NETS - MOVING P.O.V.

     We are moving very quickly underwater. Ahead of us are
     some large FISHING NETS with a catch of fish carried in
     the bunt. Quickly we are heading for a collision.


 23  EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - OFF NEW ENGLAND COAST - DAY           23

     A great day for fishing. Slicing through the water we
     SEE three New England Fishing TRAWLERS, the HARPO, the
     CHICO, and the GROUCHO.


 24  EXT. THE HARPO - SAME - DAY                                 24

     ARTHUR is at the wheel. Suddenly the engines WHINE as
     the ship begins to slow down. Surprised, Arthur checks
     his throttle.


 25  EXT. THE CHICO - SAME - DAY                                 25

     LEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE
     of their own ship.

                            LEONARD
               Jerry, why are we slowing down?

                            JERRY (O.S.)
               She's heavy in the bunt.

                            LEONARD
               That was fast.


 26  EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY                               26

     The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on
     his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to
     him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules
     slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.

                            DECK HAND
               The nets are full!

                            JULES
               Then bring 'em in!

                            DECK HAND
               We can't. She won't budge!

     Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship
     ROCKS.


     ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL

     Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon
     all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long
     beat.

                            ARTHUR
               What is going on?

     Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move
     BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS!

                            LEONARD
               She's going sternway!

                            FIRST MATE
               What the hell did we catch?

     The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS
     in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches
     begin to CRACK under the building pressure.

     The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards.
     Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto
     the decks of the ships.

                            JULES
               Cut us free! Cut the nets!

     The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs
     an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.

     Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are
     brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets.
     Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
     are dragged helplessly backwards.

                            ARTHUR
                      (screaming at his men)
               Cut the damned cables!


     A CABLE SNAPS!

     Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
     cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.


     ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!

     Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is
     freed.


     THE HARPO

     Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards,
     faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then
     suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN,
     dipping into the water.

     With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER
     WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is
     CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE
     SEA.

     For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just
     happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.

     Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out
     of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on
     its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves
     of Jules and Leonard don't.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


 27  EXT. CLOUDY SKIES - MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - DAY          27

     A storm is brewing ahead as this large Military
     Transport plane glides into view then BANKS away.


     PETRI DISH

     A small piece of Nick's SAMPLE is cut away and placed on
     a glass microscope slide.

                                             WIDE TO REVEAL:


 28  INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - SAME - DAY                  28

     Nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily
     unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his
     microscope, examining his specimen.

     Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to
     Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the
     plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their
     discussion.

                            SOLDIER
               Major, we just got a report of a
               fishing trawler going down. Exact
               position, forty seven degrees
               latitude, 67 longitude.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What makes you think it's related?

                            SOLDIER
               The trawler was pulled under.

     The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to
     a map where the other incidents have been marked. He
     traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits
     the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred
               miles off the American Eastern
               seaboard and we don't even know what
               it is.

                            ELSIE
               Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of
               enormous reptile the likes of which we
               haven't seen since the age of
               prehistoric dinosaurs.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               So where's been hiding the last sixty
               million years?

                            ELSIE
               The depth and breath of the ocean
               floor has barely been explored. His
               kind could have survived there
               completely undetected.

                            NICK (O.S.)
               What about the traces of radiation?

     Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding
     his loosely scribbled notes in his hand.

                            NICK
               The radiation is not an anomaly, it's
               the clue. This creature is far too
               unique on every level to be some lost
               dinosaur.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Don't tell me why it's not, tell me
               what the hell it is.

                            NICK
               What do we know? It was first sighted
               off the French Polynesian Pacific. An
               area that has been exposed to dozens
               of nuclear tests over the last thirty
               years.

                            ELSIE
               Hence the radiation.

                            NICK
               More than that. I believe this is a
               mutated aberration, a hybrid from the
               fall out in that region.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               Like your earthworms?

                            NICK
               Yes! We're looking at a completely
               incipient creature. The dawn of a new
               species. The first of its kind.

 30  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     30

     Dripping wet, Audrey enters from the rain, removing her
     raincoat. She walks to a booth where Lucy and ANIMAL, a
     slovenly, Italian video cameraman is his mid-thirties,
     are taking their lunch break. Animal has two plates of
     food he cobbles down.

                            AUDREY
                      (sitting)
               My life sucks.

                            LUCY
               Oh, please, your life doesn't suck.
               His life sucks.

                            ANIMAL
                      (between chews)
               That's cuz I'm married to you.

                            LUCY
               Shut up. How can you eat like that?

                            ANIMAL
               Big bites.

                            AUDREY
               I can't believe he put the moves on
               me. After everything I've done for
               him.

                            LUCY
               He's scum! As far as he's concerned
               you're just a pair of breasts that
               talk.

                            ANIMAL
               I like that image.

                            AUDREY
               You know how I spent last weekend?
               Walking his damned dog.

                            LUCY
               I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a
               douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap,
               puke chunks...

                            ANIMAL
               Hey, hey! I'm eating here!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's
               your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in
               this town. You gotta be a killer to
               get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'?
               I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't
               got what it takes.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, you don't think that's true,
               do you?

                            ANIMAL
               Nice guys finish last. First rule of
               the jungle.

                            AUDREY
               Well, I can be tough if I want.

                            ANIMAL & LUCY
               Yeah, sure.

                            AUDREY
                      (seeing something)
               Oh my God!

     Everything turns to see what Audrey is looking at.
     Audrey gets up and rushes over to a television above the
     counter.

                            AUDREY
                      (excitedly)
               Turn that up, turn it up.

     The waitress does. On the t.v. plays the same news story
     we saw from before from Panama. This time we SEE Nick
     and Major Hicks walking on the beach.

                            AUDREY
               It's Nick! I know that guy. I know
               him!

               Who is he?

                            AUDREY
               He was my college sweetie! Look at
               him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What
               the hell is he doing in Panama.


 31  EXT. NEW YORK FISH MARKET - BELOW JFK HIGHWAY - DAY         31

     Even in the rain doesn't keep people away. Buyers haggle
     with sellers. A large MARKET, truck loads of fish. No
     one seems to notice the river across from them...


     MOUTH OF THE EAST RIVER

     Enormous turbulence in the water. Slowly something
     begins to LIFT, sheets of water fall. Bursting out, the
     backside TALONS of the enormous reptile pierce through.
     The TAIL slices through the turbulence.

     Two ships anchored at dock begin to LIFT UPWARDS as the
     beast below them begins to rise.


     ANGLE FISH MARKET

     A groaning WAIL ROARS, echoing. The people of the fish
     market turn just in time to see...


     THE ANCHORED SHIPS

     Lifting impossibly into the air above the pier. Suddenly
     a TIDAL WAVE of water comes CRASHING down, flooding the
     fish market.


 32  INT. TRANSIT BUS - P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD - RAIN -       32
     DAY

     Through the swinging windshield wipers of the bus we see
     the JFK highway in front of us. Suddenly we see...


     AN ENORMOUS FOOT

     Comes crashing down atop JFK highway, crushing it. The
     TRANSIT BUS tumbles off the demolished highway.

     The man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH
     puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED
     IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the
     truck.

     He lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market
     stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a
     loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground
     nearby.


 33  EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - BUILDING STEPS - RAIN - DAY          33

     With a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him,
     the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of
     umbrellas.

                            MAYOR
               I'd like to thank you all for coming
               out on this beautiful New York City
               day.

     Some in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the
     sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the
     distance.

                            MAYOR
               When I came into office four years
               ago, people didn't think we could
               reduce crime and I did.


     ANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD

     leaning to the cop next to him.

                            COP
                      (sarcastic)
               Yeah, he did.

                            MAYOR
               People didn't think I could restore
               order...

     This time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder.

                            MAYOR
               ...and I did. The city is a safer
               place today...

     Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with
     fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly
     with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to
     CRUMBLE.

                            MAYOR
                      (to his aides)
               What the hell....

     People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the
     falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled
     inside by his security men.

     Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we
     SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris
     out of its way.


     SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT

     Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET
     of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and
     SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the
     beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast.

     After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the
     doorway to see the demolished street scene.

                            MAYOR
               What was that?


 34  INT. WNEW - CAIMAN'S OFFICE - SAME - DAY                    34

     Caiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some
     files. Rain and thunder continue outside.

                            CAIMAN
                      (into phone)
               I don't give a crap about some war in
               a country I can't pronounce. That's
               not a lead story. Find me a damned
               story, will ya!

     Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade
     SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING
     approaching. She turns and SEES...


     GIGANTIC TEETH

     The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by
     Caiman's office window.

                            SECRETARY
               Mr. Caiman. I think your story just
               walked by the window.

     Caiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused,
     she's dazed.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

     Just then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip.


 35  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     35

     Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying.

                            LUCY
               Did Romeo have a name?

                            AUDREY
               Nick Tatopoulos.

                            ANIMAL
               That why you dumped him?

                            AUDREY
               No! I just couldn't see myself with
               some boring egg head who spends his
               summer picking apart cockroaches. I
               wanted to have some adventure, some
               fun...

                            LUCY
               And now you live the glamorous life of
               Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch,
               ain't it?

     In the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching.

                            ANIMAL
               How long where you and dis guy goin'
               steady?

                            AUDREY
               Nearly four years...

                            LUCY
               Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he
               didn't ask you to marry him.

                            AUDREY
               That's the problem. He did.

     Suddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone
     in the diner reacts.

                            LUCY
               Tell me that's not another goddamned
               parade.

     The next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to
     fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in
     PANIC.

                            ANIMAL
               That's ain't no parade...

     Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING.
     Through the front window we SEE...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are
     SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW,
     shattering it.

     Animal uses his size to COVER the girls from the falling
     debris. As the danger passes, Animal charges for the
     door.

                            LUCY
               Victor, wait!


 36  EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - RAIN - DAY                       36

     Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced
     fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn. Animal
     goes over to his NEWS VAN that has been partially
     crushed.

     He pries open the rear door and takes out his video
     camera and takes off running. Audrey and Lucy arrive too
     late to stop him.

                            LUCY
               Victor, don't!


     ANIMAL RUNNING

     Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the
     debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera.
     It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...


     P.O.V. THE TAIL

     Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks
     ahead. Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small
     alleyway.


 37  EXT. OTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS                              37

     His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape
     inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts
     out into the street to get his shot.

     The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see,
     CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.

     Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire
     massive creature that is...


     GODZILLA

     as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is
     ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.

     Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in,
     sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light
     goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.


     P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA

     Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly
     covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about
     to come down directly on us.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh shit!

     Before he can do anything about it...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the
     gargantuan foot SMASHES DOWN.

     In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing IN
     BETWEEN THE BEAST'S TOES. Abruptly the foot LIFTS
     again. Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear.


     ANGLE - ANIMAL

     Close on Animal as the endless TAIL of the creature
     DRAGS just past him. It seems to go on forever. Finally
     it disappears.


     WIDE ANGLE - TABLEAU OF A DEMOLISHED STREET

     Deserted and demolished. Cars burn, debris falls.
     Animal, the lone figure, just stands there, his chest
     heaving, hyper ventilating.

                                             CUT TO:


 38  EXT. NEW JERSEY STREETS - LOW ANGLE - AFTERNOON             38

     A military CONVOY with Police escort RACES past us.


     ABOVE - HELICOPTER SHOT - CONVOY

     Sirens BLARING, the convoy and escort speed onward.


 39  INT. MILITARY SEDAN - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SAME             39

     Just as they arrive at a military roadblock. Crowds have
     gathered as the military try to keep them at bay.


 40  EXT. NEW JERSEY SHORE - CLIFF SIDE - DAY                    40

     The guards let the convoy pass. The military is putting
     up a number of large tents. A SERGEANT moves over
     quickly to greet the team as they exit their vehicles.

                            SERGEANT
                      (quick salute)
               Sergeant O'Neal, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Any word from the Mayor's office?

     Just then dozens of NEWS VANS pull up. Reporters and
     camera crews come rushing toward them. The guards rush
     to intercept. Stepping out of the next car in the
     convoy, Nick and Elise join Major Hicks.

                            SERGEANT
               They've agreed to evacuate the city.
               They've called out the National Guard
               and riot police are on alert.

     As they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close.
     Nick and Elsie are overwhelmed.

                            ELSIE
                      (aside to Nick)
               Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three
               million people. Has that ever been
               done before?

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Several military guards have to clear a path for them as
     they enter the tents.


 41  INT. COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY                        41

     Still in construction. The team enters.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Status report?

                            SERGEANT
               We've lost sight of it, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You want to run that by me again?

                            SERGEANT
                      (nervous)
               After the initial attack he
               just...disappeared.

                            OFFICER
                      (interrupting)
               Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on
               the line.

     This takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he
     wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant.

                            NICK
               I don't understand. How can something
               that large just disappear?

                            SERGEANT
               We're not sure. We're scanning the
               area now.

                            ELSIE
               He probably returned to the river.
               Just like everywhere else we've been,
               we're always one step behind.

     Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open
     revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline.
     Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes.

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from
     the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city.
     Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.

                            NICK
               I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An
               island, water on all sides. But like
               no other island in the world, this is
               a place where he can easily hide.
                      (beat)
               He's in there someplace.

     A SOLDIER comes rushing in.

                            SOLDIER
               Channel eight caught it on film!

     He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On
     the screen we SEE the shaky video Animal took of the
     creature just as it was about to step on him.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...WNEW's exclusive images of the
               creature were taken less than a half
               hour ago.

     Nick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight
     of the immense creature.

                            CAIMAN
               Cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti
               barely survived this vicious attack to
               provide us with this footage.

     The sounds of applause lead us to...


 42  INT. WNEW BUILDING - SAME - DAY                             42

     Everyone is applauding as Animal, carrying crates of
     equipment, passes the t.v. playing the same news story.
     Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly.

                            CO-WORKERS
               Way to go Animal! That's my man!

     Animal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some
     files.

                            AUDREY
               Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you
               scared?

                            ANIMAL
               Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna
               kill me.

                            LUCY
               Damned right, you crazy Wop!

     We SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons
     of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break
     from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The
     station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously.

                            MURRAY
               People! We have to be completely
               relocated to the New Jersey station
               before our 5:30 broadcast.
                      (reading from list)
               Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're
               on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll
               see you in Jersey.

                            ANIMAL
               Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all
               right?

                            LUCY
               Audrey's going to stay with us
               tonight.

                            ANIMAL
               Great. See ya then.

     Animal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to
     packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay
     the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command
     tent.

                            FIELD REPORTER
                      (filtered)
               ...military and government health
               officials set up a command post on the
               New Jersey coast this afternoon...

     Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very
     excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end
     of the hall. She rushes over to him.

                            AUDREY
               Caiman, wait. Take me with you.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

                            AUDREY
               I've got something on this. I know a
               guy on the inside with the
               military...

                            CAIMAN
               Not now. You got my bag?

     Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the
     elevator.

                            AUDREY
               You don't understand, I can get us
               information...

                            CAIMAN
               Listen, this is the time when the big
               boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

     With that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed,
     Audrey just stares at him.

                            CAIMAN
               The bag?

     Audrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as
     the elevator doors close. Lucy walks over.

                            LUCY
               Come on, Girl, we've gotta go!


 43  EXT. WNEW OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER - DAY             43

     Lucy and Audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos
     that has taken over the city. Hundreds of people trying
     to leave at once. Gridlock.

     As they move into an overcrowded subway entrance,
     Audrey looks up just in time to SEE the WNEW NEWS
     HELICOPTER lifting off from the building behind them.

                                             CUT TO:


 44  EXT. MANHATTAN - HELICOPTER SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON           44

     We SEE the destroyed parts of downtown Manhattan. Police
     barricade the streets as firemen work to contain the
     fires.

                            CAIMAN (O.S.)
               ...in what city officials are calling
               the worst act of destruction since the
               World Trade Tower bombing...


 45  INT. WNEW NEW HELICOPTER - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON           45

     Caiman stares earnestly at his video camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Police and the National Guard have
               quarantined off over twenty square
               city blocks...


 46  EXT. OVERHEAD HELICOPTER SHOT OF MANHATTAN - SAME           46

     Below we see the largest traffic jam in the history of
     the city. Police and National Guardsmen guide the
     traffic.

                            CAIMAN
               ...hundreds of thousands have jammed
               the streets in the largest evacuation
               in the history of the city. And many
               people are not happy about it.


 47  EXT. MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEW - VIDEO FOOTAGE            47

     Quick cuts of people who where interviewed earlier.

                            WOMAN
               I don't understand why we have to
               leave our homes. It's over already,
               isn't it?

                            MAN
               What are we running from? A big
               lizard? I've got cockroaches in my
               building that could kick the crap out
               of it.


 48  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - GRIDLOCK - LATE AFTERNOON               48

     Near chaos as police and National guardsmen attempt to
     bring order to the hundreds of honking, screaming
     motorists.


     RIOT POLICE VAN

     Dozens of armed officers pile out of the van.


     NATIONAL GUARDSMEN

     Maintaining blockades in front of their military
     vehicles.


 49  EXT. SEVENTH AVE E - ROADBLOCK - LATER AFTERNOON            49

     The evacuation effort is made more difficult as traffic
     must be diverted away from the quarantined destruction
     area ahead. Police block the street, smoldering
     buildings behind them. The detour only makes things
     worse.


 50  EXT. CITY BANK BUILDING - WALL STREET - SAME                50

     Several National Guardsmen walk up to the City Bank
     building where they find an ENORMOUS HOLE smashed into
     the side of the building. The Guardsmen peek inside.


     GUARDSMEN'S P.O.V. - INTO BUILDING

     We SEE THROUGH the building to a hold on the other side.
     Godzilla apparently walked RIGHT THROUGH. The Guardsmen
     are visibly shaken.


 51  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME                                  51

     Way beyond capacity, the flooded subway platform bursts
     with people pushing and shoving to get into the trains.
     Caught in the craziness we find Audrey and Lucy trying
     desperately to get on board.

                            P.A.
               Please don't push. People are getting
               shoved down onto the tracks and the
               trains can't leave...

     The last to fit inside, Lucy and Audrey cram in just as
     the doors shut behind them. People left behind BANG on
     the closed doors as the subway pulls out.


 52  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - SAME      52

     A gigantic traffic back up all the way down the Westside
     Highway. The bridge is a veritable parking lot.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
               Well this is great!


 53  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATER AFTERNOON                   53

     With his close aides in tow, the Mayor stares at the
     melee below.

                            MAYOR
               If we're wrong on this evacuation
               they'll string me up from the Liberty
               torch.


 54  EXT. COMMAND CENTER - JERSEY CLIFF SIDE - LATE              54
     AFTERNOON

     The Mayor's helicopter sails over the George Washington
     Bridge and over to a small landing pad near the Command
     Center. A large group of people dressed in business
     suits await the helicopter.


 55  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON                    55

     Just as the helicopter is landing, the crowd moves
     toward the chopper.

                            MAYOR
               Who the hell are they?

                            AIDE
               It's a contingent of building owners
               and community business
               representatives.

                            MAYOR
               I don't have time for this nonsense.

                            AIDE
               Most of them are campaign
               contributors.

     Well that's a different story.


 56  EXT. LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON              56

     As the Mayor steps out he's greeted by a nervous crowd
     of people shouting, "How long do we have to shut our
     business down? Will the city cover the damages? Etc."
     Among them, DONALD TRUMP tries to get the Mayor's
     attention.

                            MAYOR
               I share your concerns. I want to get
               the city back in business as soon as
               possible.

     As he pushes through the dense crowd he runs directly
     into...


     RAYMOND

     Who waits for the Mayor. The Mayor is momentarily
     stopped.

                            RAYMOND
                      (handing his card)
               CHARGURES Insurance. We represent
               nearly thirteen percent of the
               buildings in your city.

                            MAYOR
               If you'll excuse me...

                            RAYMOND
               We are very happy that you are in
               control of this situation.

     With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving
     a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's
     collar.

                            RAYMOND
               You can count on our emotional and
               financial support.

                            MAYOR
               Oh, well, thank you very much.

     Briskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through
     the crowd. Raymond watches him pass, seeing the device
     stuck to the Mayor's collar.


     ANGLE - WNEW NEWS CHOPPER

     Rushing over from the parked news chopper, Animal and
     Caiman race for the Mayor who walks through a mob of
     reporters.

                            CAIMAN
               Hurry, we're going to miss the Mayor.

     But before he can get close, two POLICE OFFICERS stop
     them.

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Sorry, you gotta have a press ID past
               this point.

                            CAIMAN
               Don't you watch t.v.?

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Can we see your press pass, sir?

     Flustered, Caiman searches his pockets for his press
     pass.

                            CAIMAN
               I had one here on my bag. Where the
               hell did I put it?


     CAIMAN'S PRESS PASS - ECU

     We SEE Caiman's plastic smile on his press ID. Suddenly
     AUDREY'S picture is placed on top of Caiman's.

                                             WIDEN TO
                                             REVEAL:


 57  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON                57

     Smashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with
     Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his.

                            LUCY
               What the hell are you doing?

                            AUDREY
               Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?

                            LUCY
               Your old sweetheart?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well he just turned up in New
               Jersey at the military command post.
               Somehow all this is related to what
               happened down in Panama. There's a
               story here. I know it. You got any
               tape or glue?

                            LUCY
               I left my forgery kit back at the
               office.

     Audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding
     his backpack, a RULER sticking out of the back.

                            AUDREY
               Hey, do you have any glue in your
               bag?

                            KID
               What's it to you?

                            AUDREY
               Can I use some?

                            KID
               What do I get?

                            AUDREY
               The warm feeling of helping your
               fellow man.

                            KID
               Five bucks.

                            AUDREY
               You're kidding, right?

     The Kid simply puts his hand out.


 58  EXT. NEW JERSEY TRAIN STATION - LATER                       58

     People FLOOD off the train out into the station.

                            P.A. ANNOUNCER
               Please exit the station. For those of
               you without accommodations, the city

               60th and at Bergenline and 72nd.
               Please exit the...

     Audrey and Lucy walk through the crowd. Audrey turns and
     gives Lucy a kiss.

                            AUDREY
               Wish me luck!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, I don't think this is a very
               good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll
               have your job.

                            AUDREY
               I'm tired of waiting for someone else
               to give me an opportunity, Luce. If
               there's a story here I'm going to find
               it.

     Lucy nods in acceptance as Audrey disappears into the
     dense crowd. Lucy worries for her friend.

     "YUM YUM DOUGHNUTS" BAG - PRE-SUNSET

     Carried along with a Styrofoam cup of coffee. We WIDEN
     TO REVEAL a MAN carrying the junk food to a GREY VAN
     parked not too far from the Command Center Tent across
     the way.

     The man knocks on the back of the van. The van opens to
     reveal...


 59  INT. RAYMOND'S VAN - PRE-SUNSET                             59

     Filled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and
     his men are listening in to a conversation. The man with
     junk food hands it to Raymond.

                            RAYMOND
               Merci.

     He opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites
     into it and grimaces. To wash away the taste, he drinks
     from the coffee. It's worse than the croissant.

                            RAYMOND
               You call this coffee?

                            MAN
                      (French accent)
               I call this America.

     The man takes a seat near Raymond as Raymond turns up
     the volume on his headset.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
                      (mid argument)
               You're telling me that in an election
               month I've evacuated the entire city
               for nothing?


 60  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM (TENT) - PRE-SUNSET            60

     From behind the Mayor's head we SEE the monitoring
     device attracted to his collar. As he speaks we WIDEN TO
     REVEAL...

                            MAYOR
               Do you realize what this evacuation
               will cost the people of this city!?

     Representatives of all branches of the military,
     National Guard and the Mayor's office are here. The room
     overflows with people. Nick, Elsie and the scientist
     stand near the back of the tent.

                            ADMIRAL PHELPS
               We're been monitoring the waters
               around the island. As far as we can
               tell it hasn't left the area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We think there's a strong reason to
               believe it may be hiding inside one of
               the buildings within the sequestered
               area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure!

     Just then Sergeant O'Neal enters hurriedly. He wants to
     speak but waits for the opportunity.

                            MAJOR
                      (controlling his temper)
               Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those
               buildings then we give the all clear.
               But not until we've checked each
               building!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Sir, that may be more difficult than
               we originally projected.

                            MAJOR
               More good news?!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               We've run into a problem.

     A SIGN READING: SUBWAY STATION: 23RD STREET - SUNSET

     We CRANE DOWN to reveal several military sedans pulling
     up into FLAT IRON SQUARE (where Broadway meets 5th).
     Sergeant O'Neal leads the team out of the cars and down
     a subway entrance.


 61  INT. SUBWAY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS - SUNSET                 61

     Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very
     large subway station. For all we see it seems like a
     normal subway station except for the fact that every one
     of the team members look ASTONISHED.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Lt. Anderson and his men found this
               late this afternoon.

     The camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we
     suddenly SEE what the team is staring at...


     AN ENORMOUS HOLE

     The four normal subway tunnels have been CARVED OUT
     making one GIGANTIC TUNNEL. Debris and crumbled brick
     are everywhere. Several SOLDIERS with flashlights
     approach the hole.

     Lt. Anderson moves over to the astonished group. Some of
     the scientists fan out, examining the area.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               We were checking the office building
               above when we discovered the floor was
               gone.


     LOW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HOLE IN THE CEILING

     We SEE that not only is the ceiling gone but the
     building above is hollowed and torn to shreds. Another
     hole in the building leads to the street.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               When we learned he could burrow his
               way through the tunnels we realized he
               could be out of the quarantined zone.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
               island?

                            LT. ANDERSON
               Only five, Sir. We've checked them
               all. He hasn't used any of them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Have them sealed off.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               And how should we do that, Sir?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fill them with cement, brick them up,
               put land mines in them, bombs, I don't
               know, just make sure that goddamned
               thing doesn't leave the island!


     ANGLE - INSIDE DARKENED TUNNEL

     As the SOLDIERS slowly move down deeper into the
     tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area. Could
     they stumble onto something dangerous?


     ANGLE - NICK

     as he approaches Major Hicks and Sergeant O'Neal.

                            NICK
               You know, he's not an enemy trying to
               evade you. He's just an animal.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What are you suggesting?

                            NICK
               When I needed to catch earthworms, I
               knew the best way to catch them was
               not to chase them. I had to draw them
               out.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling
     these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant.


     BACK TO TEAM

     Nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into
     the dark tunnel.

                            NICK
               All we need to do is find out what it
               wants, what it needs, and he'll come
               to us.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     The lead Soldier SEES something. Cautiously he moves
     forward thinking he's onto something. We HEAR something
     MOVING in the darkness.

     We FOLLOW his beam as the noise grows clearer. The beam
     falls onto something on the floor...


     A FISH

     Flopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam
     moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead.

     behind.


     COBRA HELICOPTERS - SAME - MAGIC HOUR

     Banking in formation, the helicopters swerve, heading
     towards mid-town Manhattan.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION

     Soldiers pile up sand bags, creating a make shift
     fortification. SHARP SHOOTERS and a BAZOOKA BRIGADE
     settle into place.


 63  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   63

     Major Hicks moves over to a jeep and grabs the radio.


 64  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       64

     Major Hicks sits by a bank of communications
     technicians.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Where are they now?

                            RADIO TECHNICIAN
               Delta niner, what is convoy position?


 65  EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    65

     Led by armored military vehicles we SEE a convoy of
     TWENTY YELLOW DUMP TRUCKS passing over the bridge.

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
               Command, we're just entering the
               city.

     Sergeant O'Neal listens to the response on the radio.

                            RADIO TECHNICIAN
               Convoy ETA, five minutes.

     The Sergeant signals several military technicians, who
     are mounting several video cameras to hurry.


 67  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       67

     A buzz of activity. Military Officials and personnel.
     The Mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the
     room.

                            MAYOR
                      (whispering to Aide)
               They find anything yet?

     The Aide shakes his head. Monitors come to life with a
     live video feed-from several cameras we saw mounted.


     A CABLE REPAIRMAN - MAGIC HOUR

     In blue overalls, the REPAIRMAN walks up to a large
     satellite dish. We WIDEN to REVEAL the dish is parked
     next to the Command Tent. He kneels down next to some
     cables leading away from the dish toward the Command
     Tent.


 68  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAGIC HOUR                              68

     Suddenly all the screens FUZZ OUT. Just as quickly the
     monitors return to normal. No one seems to notice.


 69  EXT. SATELLITE DISH - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                     69

     The Repairman finishes affixing a small DEVICE to the
     cable. He taps his earpiece and speaks into his own
     lapel.

                            REPAIRMAN
                      (French accent)
               It is good.


 70  INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                         70

     We SEE Raymond and his men have turned this dingy Motel
     room into a command central of their own. Raymond is
     putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors
     turn on. They are seeing THE SAME VIDEO FEED as the
     Mayor. Pleased, he takes a sip. It's awful.

                            RAYMOND
               You said this was French Roast!

     His aid turns, holding a package labeled FRENCH ROAST.

                            RAYMOND
                      (defeated)
               More cream.

     His associate hands him some milk. He adds it to the
     coffee. No use, it still sucks. On the monitors we SEE
     the DUMP TRUCKS entering Flat Iron Square.


 71  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   71

     The DUMP TRUCKS arrive and the soldiers guide the
     trucks, forming a circle, their tails facing each other.
     As the last one passes it REVEALS Nick and Sergeant
     O'Neal.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I sure hope your plan works.

                            NICK
               I'm kind of hoping the same thing.

     The twenty of them, in concert, begin to dump their
     cargo.


     LOW ANGLE - CENTER OF THE DUMP TRUCK CIRCLE

     Tons and tons of FISH are DUMPED directly on top of us.


 72  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    72

     On the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish
     get dumped into a large pile in the center of Flat Iron
     Square.

                            AIDE
               Tres bizarre.

                            RAYMOND
               No.
                      (leaning forward)
               Very clever.


 73  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - FISH PILE - SAME - NIGHT            73

     A MOUNTAIN OF FISH have been piled into the center of
     Flat Iron Square.

                            NICK
               That's a lot of fish.

     A master of the obvious. Sergeant O'Neal shoots him a
     glare and moves over to the men. Together they march
     into a building at the edge of the square.


     SOLDIERS

     Loading up rifles, taking positions. GAS MASKS being
     handed out down a long line for all the soldiers.

     The TANKS move into their final positions. The National
     Guardsmen and Soldiers supporting the Tanks take
     positions.


 74  EXT. TOP OF THE SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       74

     Entering from the stairs out onto the roof, Sergeant
     O'Neal and his men take positions, observing from
     above.

     Everyone is waiting. The silence is deafening.


     ANGLE - NICK

     As everyone waits, Nick scans the area, thinking.
     Suddenly something catches his eye...


     STEAM VENT

     Through a steam vent in the streets. Nick sees STEAM
     lifting into the air. He notices several other vents
     doing the same thing around the square. Quickly Nick
     rushes over to a YOUNG OFFICER.

                            NICK
               I need your radio.

     The Young Officer leads Nick over to his jeep. Nick
     grabs the receiver.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal, the subway vents. We
               have to shut them down...


 75  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               75

     O'Neal listens to Nick on his radio.

                            NICK (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               ...With the air pressure pushing up,
               he'll never smell the bait!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (turning to soldier)
               Get some men down into those air
               vents. Shut 'em down!


 76  INT. SUBTERRANEAN AIR VENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT          76

     With a loud WHINE we HEAR the vents shutting down. The
     large whirling FAN BLADES slow to a stop.


 77  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME                                77

     One by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the
     vents are turned off. There is a long tense moment of
     waiting. When will it come? Will it come?

     Before the Young Officer can stop him, Nick rushes over
     to a manhole cover in the center of the street. The
     cover is to heavy. He yells back.

                            NICK
               We need to open all the manhole covers
               in the area. Let the scent waft down.

     The Young Officer signals other soldiers. Nick steps
     back and lets the soldiers go to work. As he walks back,
     he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection
     down a side street. He runs over to it.


     ANGLE - SIDE STREET - MANHOLE COVER

     A particularly heavy one in the center of this
     intersection (a block away from Flat Iron Square), Nick,
     alone, wrestles to remove it. With all his might, he
     drags it clear.

     Suddenly, through the hole he HEARS some STRANGE NOISES
     from below. Rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole.
     The NOISES grow increasingly louder.

     Then with a DEAFENING ROAR, the ground behind Nick
     ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as
     he does.

     Nick SPINS only to find himself face to face with the
     gigantic creature. Godzilla's head slopes down,
     apparently looking Nick in the eye.

     All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder
     hoisted rocket launchers prepared.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this. He
     gently signals with his hands that they should NOT fire.

     Sensing no danger from Nick, Godzilla simply STEPS OVER
     Nick.


     NICK'S POV - UNDER GODZILLA

     As the gargantuan creature walks over us, making a
     beeline for the fish.

     Nick turns and RUNS, following him.


 78  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                  78

     Godzilla moves into the square. The military hunkers
     down, ready to strike. Cautiously the beast moves over
     to the mountain of fish.


 79  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                    79

     Major Hicks watches the monitors as Godzilla approaches
     the fish.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Commence phase one. Let's gas it!


 80  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               80

     Everyone on the rooftop puts on their GAS MASKS.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Let 'em fly!


     ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - SAME

     All the soldiers PUT ON their GAS MASKS. A team of
     EIGHT, pull out a GAS CANISTERS and yank the releases.
     They DROP them down the long barrels of air cannons,
     preparing to fire.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION - SAME

     Nick runs past the fortification, trying to get a closer
     look. The Young Officer yells after him.

                            YOUNG OFFICER
               Where're you going? Nick!

     Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer TOSSES a gas
     mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a
     closer spot. Suddenly SAILING OVER HIS HEAD we SEE...


     GAS CANISTERS

     Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak
     across the sky landing behind Godzilla. The Yellow gas
     forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards.


     ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER

     Across the way eight MORE CANISTERS are FIRED at the
     beast. Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes.


     ANGLE - NICK

     Frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he
     DASHES forward over to a large BRONZE STATUE.


     GODZILLA

     The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins,
     his tail waving the smoke away. But the smoke returns.
     Godzilla YELLS OUT. Frustrated he rears back and
     BLASTS!

     For the first time we SEE the infamous POWER BREATH of
     Godzilla. With amazing FORCE the smoke, canisters, cars
     and anything that isn't nailed down SAILS BACKWARDS from
     the intense pressure.

     Nick is HIT by the WAVE of air pressure and is sent
     FLYING BACKWARDS, impossibly high in the air.

     An enormous fabric BANNER advertising this season at the
     MET, catches Nick who SLIDES down the banner, hitting
     the ground, HARD. Just as he looks up he SEES...


     A LARGE TRUCK

     Tumbling toward him from the power breath. Nick
     SCRAMBLES to his feet just in time as the rolling Truck
     SMASHES into the building behind where he just sat.


     ANGLE - TROOPS - FORTIFICATION

     The troops have to SCATTER as the tumbling trucks and
     cars are FLUNG AT THEM, disabling their attack forces.
     Trucks and rocket launches are CRUSHED by the tumbling
     debris.

     Godzilla CONTINUES to BLOW at everything around him.
     Cars and trucks ROLLING. Soldiers DIVING for cover. It's
     chaos.

     The glass in all the surrounding buildings SHATTER,
     shards of glass raining down. Windows, street lamps, all
     blown out by the tremendous gale force winds.


 81  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              81

     On the monitors we SEE the melee.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fire at will!


 82  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               82

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will. Fire at will.


 83  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        83

     From all angles, soldiers rush back to their equipment
     and attempt to FIRE. Very few are able to get off
     rounds.


 84  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME - NIGHT                                 84

     O'Neal tries to steady himself as the soldiers FIRE down
     at the creature below. One HOISTS a MISSILE launcher.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA - NIGHT

     As the FIREPOWER begins around Godzilla, he takes a hit
     in the shoulder and SCREAMS OUT. Suddenly he LEAPS away
     just as several MISSLES HIT the Flat Iron Building
     behind where Godzilla was standing only moments
     earlier.

     Dashing down a side street, Godzilla LEAPS over the
     waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time.
     WE'VE NEVER SEEM HIM MOVE THIS QUICKLY. Several tanks
     are SQUASHED as the beast bull dozes right through the
     regiment.


 85  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            85

     We SEE the Flat Iron Building crumbling on one of the
     monitors near Major Hicks. In the rear of the room the
     Mayor looks sick.


 86  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        86

     Soldiers come out from behind the crashed vehicles and
     debris. Only the smoldering devastation is left behind.


 87  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              87

     The monitors only show static or devastation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               O'Neal, what the hell is going on
               there!?


 88  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME                                         88

     Quickly his men are packing up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               He's gone, Sir. Echo division's in
               pursuit.


 89  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS (6TH AVE.) - SAME - NIGHT       89

     Four ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES come SKIDDING around the
     corner in hot pursuit. Each with a team manning enormous
     mounted weaponry.


     REVERSE ANGLE - 6TH AVE. - GODZILLA

     Galloping like a Gisele uptown, Godzilla is SPEEDING up
     the boulevard. The armored vehicles OPEN FIRE. Some
     shots CLIP into Godzilla's back. Ahead he is running
     directly into...


     MOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS

     Blocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE.
     Pinned down, the creature SCREAMS and DUCKS away down
     another side street. The missiles can't turn fast enough
     and SLAM into a building, DEMOLISHING it.


 90  EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - SAME - NIGHT                       90

     The window is SMASHED in. A small group of LOOTERS are
     loading up their mini-van. Finishing up the group is
     about to leave.

                            LOOTER #1
               Jimmy, let's go.

                            LOOTER #2
               Wait. I want this. Help me!

     The group rejoins Jimmy as they try to pull an enormous
     Pin Ball machine from the window. As they carry the
     machine back towards the mini-van...


     SQUASH! - GIGANTIC FOOT

     Godzilla's enormous foot flattens the mini-van like a
     pancake. The Looters go pale. As the Military Armored
     Vehicles RACE by in hot pursuit.


 91  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME - NIGHT                                91

     Godzilla BOUNDS onto Broadway and FREEZES, looking
     around. As he looks downtown he SEES...


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - MILITARY ARMORED VEHICLES

     Skidding around the corner a few blocks back, the
     armored vehicles reappear.

     Godzilla turns uptown and BOLTS. As he gets up to full
     speed...


     COBRA HELICOPTERS

     A team of FOUR COBRA HELICOPTERS swoops down heading
     directly for Godzilla.


 92  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - NIGHT                     92

     The Mayor stands over a Radio technician.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               We have him, locked on.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then FIRE damn it!


 93  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                            93

     Godzilla runs into the famous lighted square (looking
     remarkably like Tokyo) just as the COBRA'S come SWEEPING
     DOWN out of the sky.

     Godzilla SPOTS them and leaps away just as they FIRE
     missiles, which RIP INTO the famous JUMBO TRON VIDEO
     BILLBOARD, demolishing the building.

     The Cobra's SWERVE quickly, pursuing Godzilla down a
     side street.


 94  EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                        94

     Godzilla appears, turning the corner and racing down the
     street. From behind, the Cobra helicopters come
     SCREAMING down on him, they FIRE ROCKETS at Godzilla
     who, again, deftly turns a corner.

     The errant rockets BLAST into the CHRYSLER BUILDING, as
     they attempt to follow him but fail. Shards of glass come
     RAINING DOWN as the building crumbles.


     ANGLE - ARMORED VEHICLES

     As they race around the corner they SLAM ON THE BREAKS
     just as the familier CONE of the Chrysler building comes
     CRASHING DOWN just inches in front of the vehicles,
     tumbling into the street.


 95  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            95

     The static increases over the radio.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT
                      (filtered)
               That is a negative impact.

     The Mayor, in the back of the room stands, furious.

                            MAYOR
               Negative impact!?! It's the goddamned
               Chrysler building, that's what it is!

     His aides try to calm him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               You said he was locked on!


 96  EXT. SIDE STREET - COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - NIGHT          96

     Moving through the narrow side street.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
               The heat seekers can't lock. He's
               colder than the buildings around him.


 97  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                        97

     The four Cobra helicopters ZOOM around the corner and
     into 5th avenue.


     COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Godzilla is ahead of us. The choppers FIRE again, this
     time using their gun turrets, ACCELERATING toward the
     beast.

     Under heavy bullet firepower and the choppers nearly on
     top of him, Godzilla DIVES into an office building.

     The helicopters surround the crumbling building, and
     OPEN FIRE, decimating it. They STOP firing and stare
     into the smoldering mess they've made.

                            PILOT
               I think we got him.

     Just then ERUPTING out of a building behind them...


     GODZILLA

     POUNCES OUT of the building, snapping up two of the
     helicopters in one bite!

     He WHIRLS around and SWIPES another out of the air with
     his ENORMOUS CLAW. The CLAWED helicopter SLAMS into the
     ground just as...


     ARMORED VEHICLES

     come sliding around the corner, directly into the
     CRASHING HELICOPTER which explodes on impact. The entire
     team is taken out with the concussion.


 98  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              98

     Major Hicks is on his feet, steaming mad.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Echo four, where is he!?


 99  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS - SAME - NIGHT                  99

     As the remaining Cobra helicopter SWERVES around,
     Godzilla is gone.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
               I don't know sir. He just vanished.

     As the helicopter PASSES a dark building we SEE a SHAPE
     MOVE! We realize that like a chameleon, Godzilla had
     TAKEN THE COLOR of the building and hid. With the
     helicopter past him, he CHASES FROM THE REAR.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
                      (realizing)
               Oh Jesus!

     The chopper GUNS IT, full throttle. Godzilla GIVES
     CHASE. Even at its top speed it can't out run the big
     creature.

     The chopper tries to LIFT AWAY but before he can get the
     height, Godzilla SNAPS his gigantic jaws and SWALLOWS
     THE HELICOPTER WHOLE.


     STREET - WIDE ANGLE

     The fires burn and the rubble crumbles. Godzilla gives
     one final SCREAM and DIVES into a building,
     disappearing.


100  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           100

     The Major's aide try to hold him back as the Mayor is
     charging at Major Hicks.

                            MAYOR
               What the hell is the matter with you
               people?! You caused more damage than
               that thing did!


101  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                             101

     Empty and devastated. Fires continue to burn.


102  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       102

     Nick, Sergeant O'Neal and several of his men walk
     through the devastated area. Nick kneels down and
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - PUDDLE OF BLOOD

     There is a large reddish brown puddle of blood. Nick
     takes out a small glass container and scoops some up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I can't believe it. He did all this
               and we did nothing to him.

     Nick walks over to him, consoling.

                            NICK
               That's not true. We fed him.


     REVERSE ANGLE

     Only a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of
     fish once was. Our team stands there amidst the rubble.

103  INT. NETWORK NEWS DESK - VIDEO FOOTAGE                     103

     A network news ANCHOR speaks directly at us as a video
     of the Chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind
     him.

                            ANCHOR
               While it may have looked like Beirut,
               it was in fact, Manhattan where man
               and nature have collided with brute
               force.

     The video switches to the White House where we SEE the
     President signing a bill.

                            ANCHOR
               The President today declared a state
               of emergency and has issued disaster
               relief funds to New York City.

104  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - VIDEO FEEDS - SAME - NIGHT          104

     We SEE that we've been watching the video on one of MANY
     video monitors showing all the news broadcasts. As an
     assistant moves away from the monitors we FOLLOW him out
     of the truck.


105  EXT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS - SAME - NIGHT           105

     We continue to FOLLOW the assistant outside, revealing
     the enormous MOB of reporters that have gathered just
     outside the military command tents. As we FOLLOW the
     assistant he passes several reporters doing "stand-up"
     reports.

                            REPORTER #1
               ...rumors continue to mount as to the
               origin of this, perhaps, lost
               dinosaur...

                            REPORTER #2
               ...having shut down the United Nations
               in the evacuation, foreign diplomats
               are demanding an international
               coalition be assembled to track the
               creature...

     The assistant finally arrives at Caiman who is doing a
     live remote. Animal works the camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Maintaining a total media blackout,
               officials remain silent this evening
               as to their progress in containing
               this creature...

     Behind him, in the crowd we SEE Audrey pushing her way
     through the reporters, her fake ID pinned on her shirt.
     She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and
     moves deeper into the crowds.

     Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their
     collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up
     nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening.

     The cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents
     as the reporters MOB the first car in line.


106  INT. SEDAN - NICK - NIGHT                                  106

     Nick observes the chaos. Through the crowd he SEES a
     Pharmacy, a neon sign reading: Never Closes. He looks
     back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and
     gets an idea.

                            NICK
                      (to the driver)
               It's okay, I'll get out here.

     He opens the car door and pushes his way through the
     crowds who are less interested in him as they are the
     military officials.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT

     Pushing his way through, Nick SEES what a circus this
     has become; t.v. news camera crews, journalists,
     concerned citizens, worried mothers, and of course,
     merchandising...


     STREET STANDS

     Nick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys,
     copies of Animal's now famous news video clip and, of
     course, tee shirts with still images from that same
     clip.


     ANGLE - AUDREY

     Through the dense crowd, Audrey SEES Nick in the
     distance. Excited she starts to push her way through.


107  INT. PHARMACY - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT                      107

     Ringing the night bell, Nick calls for the PHARMACIST
     who enters, weary eyed.

                            PHARMACIST
               Can I help you, young man?

                            NICK
               Do you have any home pregnancy tests?
               Especially ones that test for
               catastrophic hormones or clomiphene
               citrate.

                            PHARMACIST
               This is all we've got.

     The Pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off
     the shelf home pregnancy tests.

                            NICK
               I'll take them all.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               You must have quite some harem.

     Nick spins to find Audrey standing right behind him.
     Embarrassed, Nick awkwardly pays for the tests.

                            NICK
               Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You
               look, wow, uh, how've you been?

                            AUDREY
               It's good to see you, Nick.

     The Pharmacist puts out Nick's change. He scoops it out
     and we FOLLOW them as they exit together.

                            NICK
               So you made it.

                            AUDREY
               What?

     He points to her fake press ID she's still wearing.

                            NICK
               You're a reporter. That's what you
               always wanted to be, right? I'm happy
               for you. Really, I am.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well...


108  EXT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                         108

     Nick opens the door for Audrey and follows her out.

                            AUDREY
               So, you still picking apart
               cockroaches?

                            NICK
               No, I'm into earthworms now. You
               wouldn't be interested. They're real
               "boring" creatures. Very reliable,
               dependable, no surprises...

                            AUDREY
               You're still mad at me, aren't you?

                            NICK
               You just left me without a phone call,
               a letter, nothing. All this time.
               Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.

                            AUDREY
               That was eight years ago. Some people
               change, you know.

                            NICK
               Most people don't.

                            AUDREY
               I'm sorry you feel that way.

     Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior
     and calls after her.

                            NICK
               Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight
               years is a long time. Can I offer you
               a cup of tea?

                            AUDREY
               Sure. I'd like that.

     There's an awkward moment as neither knows what to say.

                            AUDREY
               One, thing, though. Who'd you get
               pregnant?

     Off Nick's awkward reaction...

                                             CUT TO:


109  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - NIGHT                           109

     Nick has set up a mini-lab in his private, small, tent.
     The home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart. Nick
     mixes some of the contents together.

                            AUDREY
               I still can't believe it. How does a
               guy go from an anti-nuke activists to
               working for the Nuclear Regulatory
               Commission?

                            NICK
               When you and I use to attend rallies
               in college, we helped to create
               awareness. But from the inside now I
               can actually effect change.
                      (pointedly)
               I never lost my idealism.

                            AUDREY
               And exactly what changes are you
               trying to effect?

                            NICK
               I have this theory that we're
               inadvertently creating new species as
               a direct result of what we've done to
               nature.

                            AUDREY
               And you think this creature is one of
               them?

                            NICK
               Yes. The first of its kind. I found
               this blood sample earlier this
               evening...

                            AUDREY
               Blood sample? How close did you get to
               that thing?

                            NICK
               I got pretty close.

                            AUDREY
               What else do you know about it?

     Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample
     into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of
     the home test boxes and dips it in.

                            NICK
               Well, we know he eats fish, he's of
               reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's
               amphibious and...

     Nick points out the litmus paper. It turns RED.

                            NICK
               ...he's pregnant.

                            AUDREY
               Are you sure?

     Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials.

                            NICK
                      (thrilled)
               Well, obviously these tests weren't
               designed for this but fundamentally
               they're looking for the same hormonal
               patterns that would indicate
               pregnancy.

                            AUDREY
               I don't get it. If it's the first of
               its kind, how can it be pregnant?

     Excitedly Nick begins to pace.

                            NICK
               The ultimate expression of evolution,
               it reproduces asexually. Think about
               it, all kinds of creatures have been
               known to travel great distances for
               reproduction. That's why he came to
               New York. Like every species of
               insufficient progenitors, he's
               nesting!

                            AUDREY
               Nesting?

                            NICK
               Yes. Do you realize that a creature
               like this could lay as many as a dozen
               eggs at a time!

     Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.

                            NICK
               Forgive me but I've got to get this
               into the lab, to confirm all this.
               I'll be right back.

     Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
     poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
     the roof of the case she SEES...


     INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY

     Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love.
     Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
     touched.

     Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
     down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
     FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
     turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
     appears.

                            COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...

     She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
     footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
     the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.

     Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
     out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
     tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.

                            NICK
               Audrey? Audrey?

     A flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's
     confusion.

110  INT. EDITING BAY - LATER - DAWN                            110

     On two monitors we SEE Audrey doing a "stand up."

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               ...which is why in this case "all the
               kings horses and all the kings men"
               may not be able to put the big apple
               together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW.

     We pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor,
     ED, watching the piece.

                            ED
               That's it. You owe me a breakfast.

                            AUDREY
                      (turning to Animal)
               So, what do you think?

                            ANIMAL
               It's good. It's a real good piece. But
               how'd you get a hold of this
               material?

     Audrey covers her own mixed emotions.

                            AUDREY
               Like you said, "Good guys finish
               last."

     She snatches the tape and she takes off running.
     Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave.

111  EXT. WNEW TRUCK - COMMAND TENT AREA - RAIN - DAWN          111

     Rushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey
     spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE
     Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with
     another cameraman.

                            AUDREY
               Murray, I need you to look at this
               tape.

                            MURRAY
               Not now, Audrey, we've about to go
               live with the morning report.

                            AUDREY
               You're going to want to include this.
               I've got exclusive footage of other
               places this thing has attacked.

                            MURRAY
                      (suddenly interested)
               You do? Who's story is this?

                            AUDREY
               Mine!


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as
     he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field
     producer counts down to going live.


     P.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING

     Through the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on
     towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to
     reveal...


112  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - RAIN - MORNING          112

     One of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the
     window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats
     breakfast with his men. Another man, JEAN-CLAUDE,
     listens at the monitoring equipment. He turns to
     Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               Taisez-Vous.

     He turns on the room speaker.

                            MALE VOICE
                      (filtered)
               ...Major Hicks, what makes you believe
               another attempt to gun that creature
               down will work?


113  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - RAIN - SAME - MORNING       113

     Nick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this
     very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the
     room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of
     Manhattan.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               General Anderson, the problem was the
               terrain. If we lure him out into a
               more open area such as this portion of
               Central Park...
                      (points to the map)
               We should be able to take him down.

                            MAYOR
               Last time you didn't even scratch it!

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I
               mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.

     All eyes turn towards Nick who's still arranging his
     papers. Nervously Nick addresses the crowd.

                            NICK
               Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was
               injured and bled.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You see, all we need to do is get a
               better shot at it with weapons that
               don't rely on heat seeking...

                            NICK
               Um, excuse me, sir, but the
               situation's more complicated than
               that. The blood I recovered revealed
               that the creature is either about to
               lay eggs or already has.

                            GOVERNOR
               Are you trying to tell us there's
               another one of those things out
               there?

                            NICK
               I don't believe so.

                            MAYOR
               Then how can it be pregnant? What is
               this, the "virgin lizard?"

     There's a smattering of laughter in the room.

                            NICK
               No, it reproduces asexually. That's
               why we must find the nest. If we
               don't, dozens will be born, each one
               capable of laying eggs of its own.
               Very quickly we could be looking at an
               enormous population.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               So after we kill the creature we'll
               begin a search for the nest.

                            NICK
               It may be too late by then. These eggs
               will hatch very quickly.

                            CLIVE
               How could you possible know that?

                            NICK
               The fish. The fish we found down in
               the subway. He's not gathering all
               that food for himself. He's preparing
               to feed his young.


114  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - RAIN - SAME - MORNING               114

     Raymond listens intently. He grabs a folder off the desk
     and opens it. We SEE photos and documents of every
     member of the team. He finds the photo of Nick and
     examines it.


115  INT. DINER - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                         115

     Audrey shakes off the rain and moves over to join Ed and
     Animal at a booth.

                            ANIMAL
               They just promo-ed your spot. It's
               coming on right after this.


116  INT. COMMAND TENT - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                  116

     An AIDE comes in and whispers something into the
     Governor's ear, who nods approval.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must
               act quickly before this problem
               escalates.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               You want to divide our efforts based
               solely on a wild theory?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               He's come through for us before and if
               he feels strongly...

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Come through for you!? Major, your
               campaign's a disaster. You weren't
               even able to to prevent this thing
               from coming to Manhattan.

                            GOVERNOR
               Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we
               should see this.

     The Aide moves over to a television and turns it on.
     Just as the t.v. comes to life we SEE the old Japanese
     Cook.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               How the hell did this get out?

     The image of the Cook saying, "Gojira" FREEZES and cuts
     back to reveal Caiman doing his "stand-up."

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               From an old Japanese sailor's song
               called GODZILLA, a mythological sea
               dragon who attacked sailors, to our
               own modern day terror. Today in my
               special report, who is this Godzilla,
               where did he come from and why is he
               here?


117  EXT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                117

     Audrey is furious, on her feet.

                            AUDREY
               You're special report! I'm the one
               that found that stupid song! That's my
               special report, you bastard!

     Animal tries to calm her down as the story continues.

                            AUDREY
               And it's "Gojira" not Godzilla you
               moron!


118  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MORNING                      118

     Fiddling with the motel t.v., Raymond's men attempt to
     clear the fuzzy picture.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               Merde!

                            RAYMOND
               Allez, allez!

     Finally the picture clears.

               been going on for over twenty
               years...


119  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   119

     Everyone stares at the television. Major Hicks burns
     with embarrassment.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               You went to the press with this?

                            NICK
               No, I didn't...I didn't talk with
               anyone.

     The military men are furious at the breach of security.
     All eyes turn toward Nick.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               They mentioned you by name!

                            NICK
               Yes...but I...

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You gave them the tape?

                            NICK
               No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh
               my God, she took it.

     Pissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Pack your stuff. You're officially off
               this project as of now.

     Caiman is still on television, wrapping up.

                            AUDREY
               He stole my report! That's my report!

     the window looking out, thinking. Finally...

                            RAYMOND
               We're leaving.

                                             CUT TO:


     A LARGE TRUNK

     Slams shut. More suitcases and trunks. Widen to

     things away. Elsie enters.

               I'm sorry about all this.

                            NICK
               Me too.

     Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave.

                            NICK
               Make sure they find that nest before
               it's too late.

                            ELSIE
               I'll try.

     Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the
     rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey
     laying on the floor.

                            ELSIE
               Bye worm guy.

               What do you mean Murray's not there? A
               second ago you told me he was on the

     Something catches Audrey's eye.


     AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK

     Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a
     waiting cab.


124  EXT. COMMAND TENT AREA - NICK & CAB - RAIN - DAY           124

     Lifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's
     trunk.

               Where to?

                            NICK
               Newark airport.

     Audrey moves up behind Nick.

                            AUDREY
               You're leaving? Why?

     Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab.

                            AUDREY
               Is this cause of me? Because of the
               story?

                            NICK
               Well what the hell did you think was
               going to happen?

                            AUDREY
               You never said it was off the record.

                            NICK
               I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're
               supposed to be my friend. I trusted
               you.

                            AUDREY
               I didn't mean for it to turn out like
               this.
                      (confessing)
               Look, I lied to you. I'm not a
               reporter. When we broke up and I came
               out to New York I was so sure I'd make
               it. But I haven't. That's why I needed
               this story so bad. I just couldn't
               tell you I'm a failure.

                            NICK
               So you thought that made it okay to
               steal my tapes?

     The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He
     stops and turns back to her.

                            NICK
               Good luck in your new career. I think
               you really have what it takes.

     He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving
     a very alone Audrey standing in the rain.

                            AUDREY
                      (sad; to herself)
               I'm sorry.

125  INT. NEWARK AIRPORT - DAY                                  125

     Long waiting lines for people trying to leave town.
     People sleeping on the floors. Chaos. One group gathered
     around a television set.


     T.V. NEWS BROADCAST - VIDEO

     We see images from crowed refugee shelters.

               ...every shelter in the tri-state area

               people. Tent cities have begun to
               spring up all over the county...

     As we TRACK away from the t.v. we FIND Nick taking a
     seat at a small bar next to the gate. A WAITER comes
     over.

                            WAITER
               Can I get you something?

     Before Nick can answer...

                            RAYMOND
               Pernot, no ice.

     Taking a seat directly across from Nick, Raymond sits
     down, sizing him up. Nick is confused.

                            NICK
               Do I know you?

                            RAYMOND
               We've met before.

               Oh yeah, the insurance guy.

     Raymond pulls out his badge and lays it on the table in
     front of Nick.

               Oh.

                            RAYMOND
               We have learned that your American

                      (alarmed)
               Are you sure? How do you know?

                            RAYMOND
               We know.

                            NICK
               Why are you telling this to me?

                            RAYMOND
               I need you to trust me.

                            NICK
               Why do you need that?

                            RAYMOND
               I need your trust if you're to help me
               find the nest.

                            NICK
               Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.

                            RAYMOND
               We, have already taken care of them.

     Nick realizes Raymond is serious. The waiter hands
     Raymond his drink. Raymond toasts Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               Bon Chance!

                                             CUT TO:


126  EXT. TENT CITY - AFTERNOON                                 126

     A makeshift tent city has been set up in the park.
     Animal video tapes an interview with a displaced
     person.

                            DISPLACED PERSON
               No one tells us a Goddamned thing. My
               family is getting soaked out here. We
               have no place else to go. We just want
               to go back to our home.

     Animal begins to PAN his camera around the tent city
     when he SEES a SEDAN in the distance. He focus in on it
     and SEES...


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - SEDAN - NICK AND RAYMOND

     Coming to stop at a light. Animal quickly lowers his
     camera and hands it off to the Reporter he's working
     with.

                            ANIMAL
               I'll be right back.

     Animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after
     them, following.


127  EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - AFTERNOON                 127

     Pulling up in front of a warehouse, Nick and Raymond
     step out of the sedan. Staying hidden from view, Animal
     pulls over. Intrigued, he watches them enter the
     building.


128  INT. WAREHOUSE - RAYMOND'S MEN - AFTERNOON                 128

     Raymond enters with Nick. The room is filled with
     equipment; radios, guns, explosives and armored
     vehicles. We notice that more of Raymond's support team
     are here.

                            NICK
               How did you get all of this stuff into
               the country?

                            RAYMOND
               This is America. There is nothing you
               can not buy.

     Raymond gives Nick a tour.

                            NICK
               So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
               guys working with the US military?

                            RAYMOND
               I am not permitted to speak of such
               things.

     Nick stops and confronts Raymond.

                            NICK
               You said you wanted my trust, then I
               need yours.

     Raymond considers this. Finally...

                            RAYMOND
               I am a patriot. I love my country. Can
               you understand that?

                            NICK
               Sure.

                            RAYMOND
               It is my job to protect my country.
               Sometimes I must even protect it from
               itself. From mistakes we have made.
               Mistakes that we do not want the world
               to know about.

                            NICK
               Your talking about the nuclear testing
               in the Pacific.

                            RAYMOND
               Yes. This testing done by my country
               left a terrible mess. We are here to
               clean it up.


129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129

     Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down
     the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and
     peers into a cracked opened window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE

     Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware.
     Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to
     resemble those of the US Army.


130  INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME                                      130

     Nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools. Jean-Claude
     turns from the radios.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               They will set the trap at thirty
               minutes to ten.

                            RAYMOND
               That is when we will go in.

     Raymond leads Nick over to a large map.

                            RAYMOND
               We know how to get into the city. We
               just do not know where to start
               looking.

     Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the
     Flat Iron square subway station.

                            NICK
               Here. 23rd street subway station.
               Where we first found the fish. With a
               little luck, this will lead us right
               to it.

                            RAYMOND
               So you're in?

                            NICK
               Are you kidding? I always wanted to
               join the French Foreign Legion.

                                             CUT TO:


131  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON    131

     Animal quickly climbs the stairs. People are everywhere.
     He has to step over them to get to his apartment. AS he
     opens the door to his apartment he SEES...


132  INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON               132

     Filled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles
     at Animal as he enters.

                            ANIMAL
               Who the hell are all these people?

                            LUCY
               What? I just couldn't just let them
               sleep in the street.

                            ANIMAL
               Where's Audrey?

                            LUCY
               In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out
               because of you.

                            ANIMAL
               What?

                            LUCY
               All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff
               you filled her head with.

                            ANIMAL
               Me!? You where the one...

                            LUCY
               Go in there. Talk to her.

     Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom.


133  INT. BEDROOM - SAME - LATE AFTERNOON                       133

     Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up
     all around her. A television plays a news broadcast,
     boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the
     t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson
     addressing some reporters.

                            REPORTERS
                      (simultaneously)
               Can you comment on the nest? How many
               more of these things will there be?

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
                      (filtered)
               That's why I'm holding this
               conference. To try and avoid a
               needless panic.

     Animal enters and watches from the back of the room.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Contrary to some frivolous reports, we
               have no information to lead us to
               believe that there are any eggs of the
               creature in the city.

                            AUDREY
               Stupid idiots!

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

                            AUDREY
               It's all my fault. What have I done,
               Animal? What have I become? Look at
               me. This isn't me. I don't do things
               like this.

                            ANIMAL
               You made a mistake.

     Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of
     the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, I just screwed up with the only
               man who ever really cared about me.

                            ANIMAL
               Didn't you tell me he left for the
               airport?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah. Why are you asking?

                            ANIMAL
               I just saw him. He's with a bunch of
               guys who want to sneak into the city
               tonight.

     Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she
     realizes.

                            AUDREY
               My God. He's going after the nest.

                            ANIMAL
               Perfect! You wanted a story, well,
               baby, you got one.

     Excitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big
     overcoat.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, I can't.

                            ANIMAL
               Look, you want to make it up to your
               friend? Well if he's right, this is
               your chance.

     He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery
     packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.

                            AUDREY
                      (misgivings)
               I don't know. I've already made such a
               mess of things...

     Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.

                            ANIMAL
                      (smiling)
               Audrey, I'm going after them. You can
               come with me or not.

     Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens
     the bedroom window and begins to climb out.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

                                             CUT TO:


134  INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - SUNSET                            134

     Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a
     military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all
     of Raymond's men dressed similarly.

     As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a
     stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of
     one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the
     wheel.

                            NICK
               What's with the chewing gum?

                            RAYMOND
               Makes us look more American.

     Nick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough
     sell, gum or not.

                            NICK
               Just let me do all the talking.

     With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out
     into the rainy night.


135  EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - ENTRANCE - RAIN - SUNSET             135

     An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the
     Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by
     a small side entrance. Animal works the lock.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               It's the maintenance entrance. Runs
               along the side of the tunnel. When
               they repaired it last year I worked on
               a piece about it.

     Just then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They
     enter.


136  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - JERSEY SIDE - SUNSET       136

     A line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes
     through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked. Nick
     and Raymond's Humvee nears.


     ANGLE - GUARDED BLOCKADE - CONTINUOUS

     Raymond's Humvee rolls up and a GUARD walks up to the
     window.

                            GUARD
                      (checking clipboard)
               Who you boys with?

                            NICK
               Oh, we're with the three two.

                            GUARD
               I didn't ask you, soldier.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal just called down for
               us to join in.

     Now he's suspicious. The guard approaches Raymond, checks
     him out.

                            GUARD
               You got a problem talkin'?

                            RAYMOND
                      (perfect southern accent)
               Why no sir, I'm fine.

     The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally
     he waves him through.

                            GUARD
               All right, keep it moving.

                            RAYMOND
                      (ala Presley)
               Thank you very much.

     They drive off. Nick is stunned by the act.

                            RAYMOND
               Elvis Presley movies.
                      (by way of explanation)
               He was the King!


137  INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - MAINTENANCE DOOR - SAME - NIGHT      137

     The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the
     tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the
     tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit
     of the tunnel into Manhattan.


138  INT. RAYMOND'S HUMVEE - NIGHT                              138

     Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE
     dozens of military people and vehicles in a large
     meadow.


139  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LARGE MEADOW - NIGHT                   139

     The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the
     center of the field as many others are planting land
     mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area.

     The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond
     and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right
     past the trap sight and out of the park.


     TIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP

     Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to
     reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and
     heading down the subway entrance.

     Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who
     nearly topples from the weight.

                            RAYMOND
               Be careful with that.

     Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked
     EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's
     gone. Nick regains his breath and follows.


     THE FISH

     Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the
     tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find
     Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're....


140  INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                 140

     The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's
     flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team
     cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish
     are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING
     sound in the tunnel STOPS.

     Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A
     familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air.

                            NICK
               They've turned off the ventilation
               system. They're calling him to
               dinner.

                            RAYMOND
               Let's hope we are not the hors
               d'oeuvres.

     Nervously they continue onward.


141  EXT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             141

     Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's
     vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs.


142  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             142

     Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything,
     climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of
     the platform and searches down into the tunnels.


     VIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS

     Through the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of
     the tunnel.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispering)
               They're down there. Let's go.

     Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of
     the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows.


143  INT. TUNNELS - NICK & TEAM - SAME - NIGHT                  143

     Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old
     SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the
     ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING
     gets louder and louder.

     Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in
     nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds
     the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.

     Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His
     enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and
     into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.

     The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal
     beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them.


144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144

     Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel
     entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a
     panic.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, let's get out of here.

     But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as
     SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at
     him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her
     strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving
     backwards.

     Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS
     outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance
     ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL

     Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up
     just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through
     the ceiling. An amazing site.

                            AUDREY
               Shoot! Shoot it!

     Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it
     disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into
     enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter.


145  INT. TUNNEL - SAME                                         145

     Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main
     tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created,
     examining it. Nick climbs into the hole.

                            NICK
               I guess we go this way.

     Raymond and his men follow.


146  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                146

     Major Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind
     him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Sergeant, status?


147  INT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           147

     The park is bathed in light. Armed troops surround the
     area. Tanks and missile launchers are in place. Sergeant
     O'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Any sign of it?


148  EXT. ROOFTOP - SPOTTERS - SAME - NIGHT                     148

     From the rooftop of one of the central park south high
     rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area.


     SPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA

     Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his
     way up seventh avenue.

                            SPOTTER
               Got him. Section 5, heading north to
               target.


149  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME                 149

     The Sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters
     take off running, taking positions. The tanks turn their
     gun turrets towards downtown, expectantly. Missile
     launchers turn, arming devices locked.


150  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                150

     Major Hicks stands near a computerized schematic of
     Manhattan. A large RED FLASHING BLIP nears Central
     Park.


151  EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - GODZILLA - SAME                      151

     Godzilla moves up 7th Ave. He reaches Central Park South
     and STOPS. He glances over to the park where bright
     lights are glaring.

     Something is making Godzilla more cautious this time.
     Unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying
     within the shelter of the tall buildings.


     ANGLE - O'NEAL - CENTRAL PARK

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Don't fire until he's cleared the
               buildings and has moved into the
               park.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA

     Still unsure, he ROARS out, frustrated with his own
     indecision.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Come on, come on!


152  INT. TUNNELS - SAME - NIGHT                                152

     Nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel
     created by Godzilla. Climbing over the debris, they make
     their way to another opening. We FOLLOW them as they
     clamber through the hole and into...


153  INT. PENN STATION - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                     153

     The largest subway/rail station in New York. Godzilla
     has torn it to shreds. We get the feeling this is where
     Godzilla has spent most of his time. Scattered fish
     abound.

     High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall
     ceiling. Wherever it leads to is very dark. Nick and
     Raymond stare at the hole together.

                            RAYMOND
               What is up there?


154  EXT. 34TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER - SUBWAY ENTRANCE -       154
     NIGHT

     Climbing the stairs out from the subway, Nick et all
     walk up onto the street to SEE...


     MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

     The team cautiously approaches the building.


155  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           155

     Carefully moving out from between the buildings Godzilla
     takes a step into Central Park.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Prepare to fire!

     Guns are cocked, locked on and hoisted. Suddenly
     Godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around.


156  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                156

     The RED BLIP suddenly begins to move away from the
     park.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Damn it! Fire! Shoot it before it gets
               away!


157  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           157

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will! Fire at will!

     All the weapons surround the area FIRE AT ONCE. Several
     more Cobra Helicopters ZOOM DOWN out of nowhere.
     Plunging downward, they FIRE at Godzilla.

     The firepower ripping up everything around him, Godzilla
     ROARS and deftly DIVES out of the park and back between
     the buildings.

     But as he bounds over to 57th street, there is a
     contingency of MOBILE ROCKET LAUNCHERS waiting. They
     FIRE. Godzilla DODGES and the rockets DESTROY PLANET
     HOLLYWOOD as Godzilla races by.

     With the helicopters right on his tail, Godzilla makes a
     westward run across 57th street. Smashing parked
     vehicles and his tail SWIPING buildings as it DASHES.


     WEST SIDE HIGHWAY

     Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters
     SHOOTING from the air. Suddenly Godzilla LEAPS higher
     than we've seen before. He hurls himself OVER the West
     Side Highway and SPLASHES DOWN into the Hudson River,
     vanishing beneath the water's surface.


158  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                158

     Furious, Major Hicks throws his headset against the
     console violently. ADMIRAL JOHNSTON leans down into
     frame.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               Don't worry. The Navy has a little
               something there waiting for him.


     THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES

     In the murky waters of the Hudson river.


159  INT. NUCLEAR SUBMARINE - THE ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT        159

     The alarm KLAXONS are RINGING OUT as everyone rushes to
     battle stations. The CAPTAIN moves over to a sonar
     screen; a large MASS nearby blips on the screen.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (into radio)
               We've got him on sonar. Arizona
               closing in.


160  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           160

     Different monitors have put up a three dimensional
     schematic of the Hudson river. We SEE outlines of the
     three nuclear subs approaching their target.

                            RADIO VOICES
                      (filtered)

161  INT. LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT          161

     The doors are pried open. It's very dark in here, only
     the assault team's flashlights illuminate. As they enter
     the lobby, the team splits up into different search
     groups.

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude move down the large front
     lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding
     the main auditorium.


     ANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

     Cautiously they move towards us. In the distance we see
     the rest of the team moving the other direction. Raymond
     and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main
     auditorium. Nick is about to push the door open when
     Raymond stops him.

                            RAYMOND
               Jean-Claude.

     On command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic
     rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol. He
     nods "okay" to Nick who slowly opens the door.

     As the door opens a small pile of FISH tumbles down over
     their feet. They step over the fish and enter.


162  INT. AUDITORIUM - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT         162

     Total darkness. Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously
     step over the fish inside. Only their flashlight beams
     can be seen.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - TRASHED AUDITORIUM

     His beam cruises over the area nearby. It's been gutted.
     Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere. Suddenly Nick
     spots a strange cluster of OBJECTS. He moves closer.

     Raymond follows. With their combined light we can
     SEE...


     THREE ENORMOUS EGGS

     A pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are.
     Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the
     other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE
     THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING!

                            NICK
               Three eggs. I thought there would be
               more.

                            RAYMOND
               You were right.

     Slowly Nick turns and SEES what Jean-Claude is staring
     at open jawed...


     DOZENS OF EGGS

     Together their beams of light scan across the main
     auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover
     DOZENS OF EGGS piled in clumps everywhere.

                            NICK
               That can't be. That's got to be over
               twenty eggs.


163  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          163

     Another of Raymond's men (R-MAN #2) has found a
     switchboard, he examines the switches.


164  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           164

     Animal and Audrey are wandering through the debris.

                            AUDREY
               Okay, where'd they go from here?


165  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          165

     R-MAN #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits
     it.


166  INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME - NIGHT                             166

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work
     lights suddenly TURN ON illuminating the room,
     revealing...


     HUNDREDS OF EGGS

     All over the main auditorium floor. A stunning tableau.
     Nick is speechless. Raymond turns to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Start counting.


167  INT. PENN STATION - SAME                                   167

     The light filters down from the gaping hole in the
     ceiling.

                            ANIMAL
               They must have climbed all the way up
               into there.

     Together they notice some large metal piping that has
     fallen from the auditorium. They move over to it and
     begin to climb.


168  EXT. UNDERWATER - HUDSON RIVER - NUCLEAR SUB - NIGHT       168

     The Arizona races past us.


169  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                169

     We follow a runner who hands a report to the Admiral who
     is conferring with the General and Major Hicks by the
     schematic. The Admiral reads the report.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               They've surrounded the target just at
               the mouth of the Hudson river.


170  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  170

     Arizona.


171  INT. SUBMARINE - ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                    171

     The lights dim as they prepare for battle.

                            CAPTAIN
               Are we locked on?

                            ENSIGN

               Fire.


172  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  172

     The torpedo is FIRED and comes darting directly at
     Godzilla who abruptly SWERVES. The torpedo, however,
     FOLLOWS him.


     ANGLE - SUBMARINE - CALVIN COOLIDGE

     From the other direction, closing in. Godzilla DIVES,
     skidding close to the bottom. The TORPEDO begins to
     close the gap.

     Suddenly Godzilla SHOOTS UPWARDS heading directly for
     the underside of the Calvin Coolidge.


173  INT. CALVIN COOLIDGE SUB - BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT           173

     The Calvin's CAPTAIN rushes over to the sonar screens.

                            ENSIGN #2
               He's shifted course. He's heading
               right at us!

                            CALVIN'S CAPTAIN
               Full stern!


174  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME                          174

     Godzilla RAMS the underside of the Calvin Coolidge
     before she can turn. The entire sub SPINS, TWISTING OVER
     its side and colliding directly with...


     THE TORPEDO

     slams into the side of the rolling and dented nuclear
     submarine. With a CONCUSSION the sub EXPLODES.


175  EXT. HUDSON RIVER - SAME                                   175

     An enormous SPRAY OF WATER erupts from the river,

176  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   176

                            RADIO OPERATOR
               We've lost the Coolidge, Sir.

     The Admiral burns.


177  INT. ARIZONA SUBMARINE - SONAR CONSOLE - SAME - NIGHT      177

     The BLIP representing Godzilla turns.

               He's shifted course, Sir. He's heading
               back towards Manhattan.

               Fire!


180  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  180

     Boxed in from either side, Godzilla RACES through the
     water. At the same moment both submarines FIRE their
     torpedoes.

     Godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of Manhattan
     and begins BURROWING FURIOUSLY. As his gigantic claws
     start DIGGING up earth, an enormous TURBULENCE of clouds
     and dirt cloud the waters around him, cloaking him.


181  INT. ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                                181

     The torpedoes ENTER into frame and disappear into this
     undersea dust cloud. An enormous EXPLOSION BLASTS from
     its center, waves of concussion reverberate.


184  EXT. BATTERY PARK - MANHATTAN - SAME - NIGHT               184

     With the EXPLOSION and enormous TIDAL WAVE rises and

     Toppling down out of the murky turbulence, we SEE
     Godzilla falling away from the shoreline, backwards the
     ocean floor, drifting down to the bottom of the Hudson
     river like so many cement shoed gangsters.


188  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT                  188

     Raymond and his men are laying out the plastic
     explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs.
     Jean-Claude walks up to Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We do not have enough explosives.

     Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a
     group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him.


     ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME

     Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor,
     Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they
     see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film
     as an amazed Audrey walks through.


     ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK

     Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them.
     Raymond approaches.

                            RAYMOND
               Nick, we have a problem.

     Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to
     listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell.
     Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards.

     The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across
     the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and
     SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in
     close to one getting video footage of it cracking.
     Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however,
     is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it
     approaches from behind.


     ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND

     Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS
     FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous
     WAIL.

                            RAYMOND
               I think we should leave now.

                            NICK
               Good idea.

     The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts
     GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick
     and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough
     distance, they they break into a run and head for the
     exit.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears
     Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispered)
               One more second. This is fantastic.

     Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind
     Audrey.

                            AUDREY
               Don't you think we have enough?

                            ANIMAL
               Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

     Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes
     go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA
     appear on the other side of them.

                            ANIMAL
               Just be calm. Don't startle them.

     Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way
     towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the
     floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin
     to SNIFF the air.

     Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM
     breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey
     FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both
     suddenly take off running.


189  INT. MID-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                             189

     Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls
     out his radio.

                            RAYMOND
                      (into radio)
               Everyone, outside! Now!


     ANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM

     Laying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio,
     he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near
     them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off
     running.


190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190

     Two other men are still laying cables for the
     explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH
     near the eggs.

                            R-MAN #2
               Come on, let's go.

                            R-MAN #3
               One moment. I've almost got this.

     Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in
     his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE
     AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly
     retreating R-MAN #3.

     He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
     fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.

     But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and
     LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at
     Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the
     side.

     In moments, they are both devoured.


191  INT. TEAM ENTRANCE - FLOOR-LEVEL - SAME                    191

     Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside.
     The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They
     turn back just as...


     THREE BABYZILLAS

     appear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR.
     Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls
     him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open.


192  INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              192

     Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as
     Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind
     them. There is a sudden THUD against the door.

     Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with
     all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door.

                            AUDREY
               Great. Now what do we do?


193  INT. HALLWAYS - MID-LEVEL - SAME                           193

     Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look
     inside.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM

     Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS
     everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to
     devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away
     and turns and stares directly at us.

     Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both
     retreat back into the hallway. Raymond SMASHES the glass
     covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
     door handles, locking it closed.

     Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
     the locked doorway.

                            RAYMOND
               We've got to lock them inside while we
               can.

     Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               Contact the military and get them to
               send a bomber to blow up this building
               before these things escape.

                            NICK
               How do I do that?

                            RAYMOND
               555-7600. Tell them it's a code
               dragonfly. They should get you
               through.

     Amazed by Raymond, Nick just stares at him.

                            RAYMOND
               What are you waiting for?

     Nick snaps out of it and dials.

                            OPERATOR
                      (filtered)
               ...all circuits are busy right now.
               Please hang up and try again...


194  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT               194

     A large and ANGRY mob has gathered at the roadblock to
     the bridge. People, their cars packed with belongings,
     are screaming to be let back into Manhattan. Horns honk
     and the blockade guards are getting nervous.


195  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           195

     The Mayor marches over to Major Hicks who is consulting
     with the Generals.

                            MAYOR
               Do you have any idea what's going on
               out there? The phones are ringing off
               the hook with people screaming to be
               let back into the city.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're sending divers into the river
               now to retrieve the body.

                            MAYOR
               That thing's dead. What the hell are
               we waiting for?

     Just then Elise rushes over to the Major.

                            ELSIE
               Major, if Nick is right, this could be
               our last chance to do something about
               it. We have to search for the nest,
               now.

     Major Hicks is torn. Finally he nods in agreement,
     turning to another officer.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Organize a search party. I want a
               complete sweep of the entire city and
               subway system.

                            MAYOR
               You don't have the authority to do
               that.

     The Major turns and cooly approaches the Mayor.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Try and stop me.

     Major Hicks smiles at the Mayor who exits, petulantly.


196  INT. AUDITORIUM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - DOORWAY -        196
     NIGHT

     We SEE dozens and dozens of Babyzillas fighting with
     each other over the last of the fish. Suddenly this
     image is SLAMMED SHUT as doors are closed and a FIRE
     HOSE is rapped around door handles. We widen to
     reveal...

     Raymond fastening the hose around the door. Secured,
     Raymond takes off running.


197  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - HALLWAY - SAME                197

     Nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as Raymond
     comes up. We hear a BUSY signal from the phone. Nick
     dials again.

                            RAYMOND
               What'd they say?

                            NICK
               I can't get through. I don't know
               what's wrong.

                            OPERATOR
                      (filtered)
               ...all circuits are busy right now...

     Jean-Clude and his partner arrive.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We've secured the doors on both
               levels.

                            RAYMOND
               Where's Luc and Pierre?

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               They didn't make it.

                            RAYMOND
                      (quickly recovering)
               Nick, my men and I will hold them
               here. You will have to go and get
               help!

     Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs. The
     rest of the team SNAP TOGETHER their automatic rifles
     and prepare for a fight.


198  INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME                                    198

     Animal and Audrey are checking out every corner of the
     room.

                            ANIMAL
               There's got to be another way out of
               here.

     Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate
     covering the air vent.

                            AUDREY
               Think we can fit up in there?

                            ANIMAL
               Only one way to find out.

     He rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside.


199  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                           199

     Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the
     doorways. A loud THUMP is heard on the door they are
     guarding. Each turns their weapon towards the doors.
     Suddenly a portion of WALL BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSES.

     A DOZEN BABYZILLAS leaping through the plaster. As they
     spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open
     FIRE. One of the Babyzilla's is HIT.

     His brothers ATTACK. Luc from the other side tries to
     lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd.


200  INT. HALLWAY - MAIN LOBBY LEVEL - SAME                     200

     Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway.
     Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other
     side.

     Just up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he
     can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door
     in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as...


     DOZENS OF BABYZILLAS

     Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick
     slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He
     turns to run the other directions when...


     MORE BABYZILLA

     Come BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned
     down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and
     races over, slamming his hand against the button.

                            NICK
               Come on, come on.

     The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of
     them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards
     him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and
     turn.

                            NICK
               This is not good.

     Just then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside.


201  INT. ELEVATOR - SAME                                       201

     Nick frantically pushes the CLOSE DOOR button but it's
     painfully slow to react.

                            NICK
               I hate these things!

     Just then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to
     move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a
     sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of
     them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator
     begins to rise.


202  INT. AIR VENT - SAME - NIGHT                               202

     Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls
     into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera.
     Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and
     in.

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

     Out of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again,
     pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another
     vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when
     something catches his eye.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH VENT - RAYMOND

     Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears
     with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to
     shoot.

                            AUDREY
                      (whispered)
               What? What is it?

     Animal doesn't answer, he just shoots.


203  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        203

     The elevator doors open and Raymond SWERVES his gun
     around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands
     in the air.

                            NICK
               Hey, it's me!


204  INT. VENT - SAME                                           204

     Audrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer
     down through the grating.

                            RAYMOND
               What happened?


205  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        205

     Nick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy.

                            NICK
               They're loose. They're allover the
               main lobby. I couldn't get out.

     Just then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and
     Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his
     weapon trained on their heads.

                            RAYMOND
               Who the hell are you?

                            NICK
               It's okay. I know her.

     Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera
     and FIRES, ripping the camera apart.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey! What gives?

                            RAYMOND
               No cameras.

     Nick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up.

                            NICK
               What are you doing here?

                            AUDREY
               I thought you said there'd only be a
               dozen eggs.

                            NICK
               I was wrong.

     Just then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked
     door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier.

                            RAYMOND
               Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie?
               Anything we can use to contact the
               outside.

                            AUDREY
               What about the phones?

                            NICK
               Circuits are overloaded.

                            AUDREY
                      (gets an idea)
               I know a way. I know how you can get
               a message out of here.

     The door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into
     the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet.

                            AUDREY
               This way.

     She takes off running and they follow. The Babyzillas
     give chase. Animal, hangs back and runs over to the
     destroyed video camera and PULLS OUT THE TAPE. Just as
     he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him. He
     dashes off.


     ANGLE - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR

     Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that
     leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside.

     She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear
     and begin to SNIFF the doorway.


206  INT. HALLWAY - LUXURY BOXES - SAME - NIGHT                 206

     They spill out into the hall and rush past all the
     luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium.

                            AUDREY
               Come on, the broadcast booth is right
               over here.

                            NICK
               How do you know?

                            AUDREY
               Our network covers the Ranger games.


207  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   207

     The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway SNIFFING. One
     of the more aggressive ones starts to CLAW at the door,
     RIPPING into it. Another charges it, THUD.


208  INT. LUXURY BOX HALLWAY - SAME                             208

     They rush up to a door marked BROADCAST BOOTH. Audrey
     tries the door, it's locked. Animal charges his shoulder
     into it, but it doesn't give.

     Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and SHOOTS
     the lock to pieces. He opens the door for everyone to
     enter.


209  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        209

     They rush into the empty broadcast booth. Animal turns
     on the lights as Audrey goes over and boots the computer
     terminal. Raymond moves some equipment against the door,

               The network is on an intranet. It's a
               direct feed into our computer system.

                            NICK
               Your station won't have any easier
               time contacting the military than I
               did.

     That stumps her. Animal gets an idea.

                            ANIMAL
               When you worked with them, did they
               monitor the news broadcasts?

                            NICK
                      (getting the idea)
               Yes, they did.

                            ANIMAL
               We'll go live! We'll broadcast from
               here. Hopefully they'll see it.


210  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   210

     More of the creatures have gathered by the door. Two
     more CHARGE and the door collapses. The Babyzillas rush
     up the stairs.


211  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - EDITING BAY - SAME                  211

     Ed is watching the news feed. Caiman is on.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...Yes, the threat is over but the
               pain continues...

     Suddenly Ed's computer begins to BEEP. Ed slides his
     chair over and looks at his monitor. It reads NEW MAIL:
     URGENT! He double clicks it and a letter pops up that
     reads. Ed pick up transponder CFX 1 and watch the feed.

                            ED
                      (to himself)
               There's no Ranger game on tonight.

     Ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and
     turns on a blank monitor. He SEES...


     C.U. MONITOR - AUDREY

     Racing in front of the camera we SEE Audrey in the
     control booth.

                            AUDREY
               ...If you're seeing this, Ed, please
               put us on Live! This is urgent! I know
               this sounds crazy Ed but you have to
               do it. Please, trust me.

                            ED
                      (incredulous)
               I'm not putting you on live!


212  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                212

     Nick turns on a small television and we still SEE Caiman
     doing the news. Audrey turns to Animal.

                            AUDREY
               He's not going to do it.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh yes he will.

     Animal turns the camera and points out the window at the
     BABYZILLA'S below.


213  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - SAME                                213

     Ed's eyes nearly pop out of his head.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Ed, you see that? They'll be all over
               the city if we don't stop them!

     Ed rushes over to the console and goes to work.


214  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   214

     The mode is festive.  The Generals are preparing to leave
     as is Major Hicks. Sergeant O'Neal and some of his men
     are watching the t.v. news.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...as our fears have been allayed
               thanks to the dedicated work of our
               boys in uniform...

     Everyone in the room begins to cheer. Suddenly Caiman's
     image goes fuzzy. In a moment it's replaced by Audrey.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Are we on? Are we live?


215  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                215

     Nick SEES Audrey on the t.v. and gives her the thumbs
     up.

                            AUDREY
               We're live from inside Madison Square
               Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has
               discovered the beasts lair. Doctor,
               tell us what is happening here.

     Animal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays
     back behind the camera, watching.

                            NICK
               We've discovered over two hundred eggs
               which began hatching only moments ago.


216  INT. LUXURY BOXES HALLWAY - SAME                           216

     The creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and
     flood into the hall. Sniffing around they pick up the
     scent and take off.


217  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   217

     A Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his
     attention.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What is it?

                            SOLDIER
               You better see this.

     The Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the
     t.v.

                            NICK
               If the military are listening, they
               must immediately destroy this building
               before they can escape.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Oh my God! They're coming!

     The camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths
     across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching.


218  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     218

     The bedroom is packed with Lucy's "guests" as they watch
     the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas.

                            LUCY
               Oh my God!

     On the screen the image turns to Nick.

                      (filtered)
               If those creatures escape and
               multiply, in a very short time a new
               species will emerge. One that could
               replace us as the dominant species of
               this planet.


219  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   219

     Major Hicks is on the phone.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into phone)
               That's correct, I want you to blow up
               Madison Square Garden. No I'm not
               drunk.
                      (to O'Neal)
               Contact the news station. Tell them
               we're on the way.


220  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        220

     Raymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable. Quickly he
     ties it to the support beam.

                            AUDREY
               Reporting live from Madison Square
               Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds,
               WNEW.


221  INT. AUDREY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                   221

     Everyone is breathless watching the news. Lucy beams.

                            LUCY
               That's my girl.


222  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                222

     Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent.

                            NICK
               Thanks, Audrey.

     The computer beeps, Animal reads the message.

                            ANIMAL
               The good news is they got the message.
               The bad news is we've got five and a
               half minutes to get out of the
               building.

     Suddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing
     against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet.

                            RAYMOND
               Okay, party's over. Time to leave.

     With that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window
     SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses
     the spool of cable out the broken window.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone care to join me?

     Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on
     his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond.


223  EXT. AIR BASE - F-18 SQUADRON - SAME - NIGHT               223

     Several F-18's prepare to take flight. We focus on one,
     an enormous bomb attached under its wing. The F-18 taxis
     away from us.


224  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AUDITORIUM - SAME             224

     Repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast
     booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level
     balcony. Raymond signals to the others to follow.


225  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                225

     Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long
     drop down. The door is begging to give way from the
     repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses
     Nick.

                            AUDREY
               In case I can't later.

     With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is
     stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES
     and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps.


226  INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                               226

     Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads
     as they make their way out.

     On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a
     doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The
     Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit.


227  INT. DARK SKIES - F-18 SQUADRON - NIGHT                    227

     The F-18's fly in formation. Their leader carrying the
     same bomb we saw loaded earlier.


228  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                    228

     Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the
     hallway. He SEES a small group of Babyzillas down the
     hall and gestures for the group to go the other way.

     Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who
     SNIFF the air and decide to pursue. Raymond turns and
     runs.


     ANGLE - FARTHER DOWN HALLWAY - AROUND THE CORNER - SAME

     As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard
     of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the
     concession stands to ribbons looking for food.

     Spotted, the Babyzillas LEAP forward after the team.
     Raymond spots the escalators across the hall.

                            RAYMOND
               The escalators, hurry!


229  EXT. SKIES - F-18'S - NIGHT                                229

     We FOLLOW the squadron as they pass us to reveal the
     beautiful MANHATTAN SKYLINE approaching.


230  INT. ESCALATOR CORRIDOR - MADISON SQUARE - SAME            230

     The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down
     and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The
     escalator comes to life.

     The team runs down the "down" escalators as the
     Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down
     the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others
     are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the
     brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.


231  INT. MAIN LOBBY HALLWAY - SAME                             231

     Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into
     the main lobby and FREEZES. They are surrounded on all
     sides by Babyzillas!

     Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily
     still as everyone freezes.


232  EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - F-18'S - NIGHT                    232

     Closing over the city, the lead bomber breaks formation,
     flying lower, closer to the rooftops.


233  INT. COCKPIT - HUD DISPLAY - NIGHT                         233

     Through the windshield's Heads-Up-Display (HUD) we SEE a
     target LOCKING ON, flashing.

                            PILOT
               I'm locking on now.


234  INT. MAIN LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE - SAME                    234

     As several SNIFF THE AIR, they begin to CLOSE IN. The
     Babyzillas from the escalator corridor finally get to
     the ground level and rush over from behind.

     Raymond spots the large hanging CHANDELIERS in the front
     lobby. He FIRES a short BURST, SLICING the cable
     supporting the chandelier.

     The chandelier DROPS and SHATTERS in the center of the
     main lobby. The Babyzillas scatter, opening a pathway to
     the front door.

                            RAYMOND
               Go! Now!

     Raymond PUSHES the team forward as he takes the rear
     through the pathway which begins to close up as they
     pass through.

     The Babyzillas recover and begin to charge. As Raymond
     passes some CANDY MACHINES, he grabs one and SMASHES IT
     to the ground.


     THOUSANDS OF GUM BALLS

     Scatter all over the floor. As the Babyzillas run, they
     begin to stumble allover each other, tripping on the
     gum balls.

     Animal is the first to reach the main door, he opens it
     and Audrey and Nick are the first to exit. Raymond,
     FIRING MADLY behind as he rushes for the door.


235  INT. COCKPIT - F-18 - NIGHT                                235

     The locked FLASHES RED.

                            PILOT
               Stallion 15, Fox 6.


236  EXT. SKIES - F-18 - BOMB - NIGHT                           236

     The immense BOMB drops and takes flight on its own. We
     can see it's heading directly for MADISON SQUARE
     GARDEN.


237  EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT                         237

     Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him. The
     Babyzillas SLAM against the doors. It takes all of
     Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors
     closed.

     Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a
     temporary lock. He pulls Animal away and they take off
     running.


     BOMB'S P.O.V. - MADISON SQUARE - NIGHT

     Rapidly approaching the famous forum.


     ANGLE - RAYMOND, ANIMAL

     Not far behind Nick and Audrey as they race from the
     building. Behind them we SEE...


     BOMB AND BUILDING

     Collide and an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS, engulfing the
     entire building in a mountain of flame.

     Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are THROWN several feet
     forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible
     impact.

     As the building CRUMBLES in FLAMES we HEAR several of
     the Babyzillas SCREAMING. Soon they are silenced.

     Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey. They're both
     shaken up. Nick touches her cheek gently.

                            NICK
               Are you okay?

                            AUDREY
               Somehow I never thought your life was
               this exciting.

                            NICK
               You'd be surprised.

                            AUDREY
               Really? I'd like to find out.

     She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to
     Raymond who has cut above his eye.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey Man, you all right?

                            RAYMOND
               I could use a coffee.

     We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting
     upwards when suddenly...


     THAT FAMOUS WAIL

     Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes,
     a very angry GODZILLA emerges!

     Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and
     nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the
     first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression
     of Godzilla's face; pain.

     But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he
     focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and
     accusingly, at our heroes.

                            NICK
               Ohhhhhhhh.....shit.

                            ANIMAL
               What do we do?

                            RAYMOND
               Running would be a good idea.

     And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our
     team DARTS around a corner just in time.


238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238

     As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla
     BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing
     off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley.


     ANGLE - ALLEY WAY

     Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to
     large brick buildings. They run for their lives as
     Godzilla appears behind them.

     His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he
     BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as
     he marches forward.

     Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just
     they make their way to the other side.

     Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla
     SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path.


239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239

     Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked
     YELLOW CAB.


240  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS - SAME                               240

     In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his
     belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column
     and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's
     amazing.

     As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even
     completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the
     engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out.


241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241

     Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings
     the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner.


242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242

     Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow
     Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner
     behind them Godzilla appears.

     As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a
     single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down
     another street.


243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243

     The cab darts onto 27th street. DEBRIS tumbles down in
     their path as GODZILLA SMASHES through another
     building.


244  INT. CAB - SAME                                            244

     The rear window SHATTERS as falling bricks and debris
     HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side
     street.


245  EXT. LEWELLEN DRIVE - SAME                                 245

     Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out
     onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down
     the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he
     does.


246  INT. CAB - SAME                                            246

     Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power
     up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and
     begins filming out the shattered back window.

                            AUDREY
               Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut
               up Broadway.

                            ANIMAL
               You're crazy, go to the east side and
               take the park avenue to the JFK.

                            AUDREY
               The JFK? In the rain!?


247  EXT. STREET - CAB & GODZILLA - NIGHT                       247

     LEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab
     as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it.


248  INT. CAB - SAME - NIGHT                                    248

                            ANIMAL
               What are you talking about? The east
               side is always faster.

                            AUDREY
               But we can get to the west side
               faster.

     Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down
     trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly,
     darting down a side street.

                            RAYMOND
               Somebody make up your mind!

                            AUDREY & ANIMAL
               Take central park!


249  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - SAME                                     249

     Taking her advice, Raymond swerves up 8th Ave. uptown.
     He GUNS IT and RACES up ahead.


250  EXT. 28TH STREET - SAME                                    250

     The last two turns of the cab have temporarily
     disoriented Godzilla who looks around to find the cab.
     He moves up a block and begins to look around.


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - CAB - SAME - NIGHT

     Several blocks ahead, Godzilla spots the cab. He narrows
     his eyes and WAILS ANGRILY. Suddenly he BOLTS after the
     cab.


251  INT. CAB - SAME                                            251

     Animal clears away the broken glass and leans out the
     back window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW - GODZILLA

     Gaining on them GODZILLA is in hot pursuit.

                            ANIMAL
               Better step on it Frenchie!


252  EXT. MEADOW - SAME                                         252

     The military is cleaning up the trap from before.
     Sergeant O'Neal SPINS as the cab LEAPS out from behind
     the trees.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               What the hell....?

     The cab POWER SLIDES right past and out of the Meadow
     again just as GODZILLA STOMPS directly into the clean up
     crew. Soldiers DIVE for cover as others scramble out of
     the way.

     Godzilla MARCHES after the cab, his tail SWIPING several
     vehicles which tumble, crashing into the troops.

     In a flash, Godzilla disappears back into the forest on
     the other side. O'Neal grabs his radio.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Command, Command, this Sergeant
               O'Neal. He's back!


253  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           253

     Major Hicks moves over towards the radios.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Captain Rogers, do we still have those
               F-18's in the air?

                            RODGERS
               They're heading back to base now,
               sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Turn 'em around.


254  EXT. BROADWAY - UPTOWN - SAME                              254

     The cab heads up the deserted streets, racing full
     tilt.


255  INT. CAB - SAME                                            255

     Animal pulls himself back into his seat.

                            ANIMAL
               I think we lost him.


256  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME                                       256

     Wrong again! Leaping out several blocks ahead, GODZILLA
     emerges. He KNEELS DOWN and gives a gigantic POWER BLAST
     of his BREATH.

     Cars, street signs, vending machines SAIL BACKWARDS from
     the force.

     A Newspaper vending machine SLAMS into the hood of the
     cab as the cab SQUEALS around a corner, avoiding the
     rest of the onslaught of debris.


257  EXT. SKIES - SAME                                          257

     The F-18's BANK and head back towards Manhattan.


258  EXT. HARLEM - SAME - NIGHT                                 258

     Racing up through the streets of Harlem we SEE the cab.


259  INT. CAB - SAME                                            259

     Everyone is looking around for the creature.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone see him.

     Suddenly from behind, Animal spots the creature several
     blocks behind. Again, he lifts the camera.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Running full boar directly at them.


260  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - CONTINUOUS                           260

     Godzilla quickly makes up ground. Running at the cab
     it's only a matter of seconds before he'll reach them.

261  INT. CAB - RAYMOND - SAME                                  261

     Raymond looks up, spots something.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - SIGN

     Up ahead is a sign for the exit for the George
     Washington Bridge. Raymond decides to take it.


262  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - SAME                                 262

     The cab SWERVES heading towards the bridge entrance just
     as Godzilla BITES DOWN, barely missing the cab as it
     turns the corner.

     Godzilla LEAPS OVER THE ENTIRE BLOCK, landing directly
     IN FRONT OF THE CAB.

     The cab SPINS, pulling a full 180 degree turn, and PEELS
     OUT just before Godzilla can SNAP DOWN again, just
     missing the cab.

     The cab PEELS around the creature and UP THE ONRAMP.

     Just then Godzilla LEAPS AFTER THEM. His jaw open, he
     BITES DOWN ON THE CAB.


263  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS                                      263

     Everyone ducks as the enormous JAWS OF THE CREATURE
     CLAMP DOWN OVER THE CAB.


264  EXT. EXIT RAMP - SAME                                      264

     Taking a gigantic BITE out of the highway, some high
     tension wires and the support structure over the bridge,
     Godzilla CHOMPS DOWN on the cab.

     The large cement SIGN SLAMS into the roof of the
     creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab
     with his teeth.


265  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      265

     The sign supports will not hold much longer as it
     crumbles just above the cab. The torn electric cables
     DANGLING dangerous close to the cab.

     Godzilla PUSHES his TONGUE towards the back of the car,
     trying to draw it into his throat!


266  INT. CAB                                                   266

     They're freaking out as the jaws are closing in on
     them.

                            AUDREY
               Gun it! Gun it!

                            RAYMOND
               I'm trying!


     C.U. CAB'S WHEELS

     Spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes
     against it, LIFTING the REAR of the vehicle.


267  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA - SAME                             267

     Like a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying
     to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of
     highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting.


268  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      268

     From the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins
     to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER.

     Nick turns and SEES...


     ELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS

     Sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign,
     Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He
     takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens
     the cab door.

     Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE
     CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick
     leans back inside, slamming the door shut.


269  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA                                    265

     He temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just
     before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again...


     C.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING

     As the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the
     wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD.


270  EXT. GODZILLA - CONTINUOUS                                 270

     As the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab
     SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece
     of highway.

     Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT,
     burning rubber as it enters the George Washington
     Bridge.

     Godzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them.
     Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase.


271  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE                              271

     The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE
     BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge
     WOBBLE.

     The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to
     the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's
     as though they were driving during an earthquake.

     With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more
     unstable.


272  EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE HUDSON - F-18'S - SAME                272

     Swooping down the F-18's head directly towards the
     bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab.


273  INT. COCKPIT                                               273

     The HUD begins to FLASH, LOCKED ON!

                            PILOT #2
               We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox
               2.


274  EXT. BRIDGE - CAB AND GODZILLA                             274

     Only a stride away from being overtaken.


275  INT. OTHER COCKPIT - SAME                                  275

                            PILOT #3
               Stallion 12, Fox 2.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     All at once they FIRE. Missiles heading right at
     camera.


     GODZILLA

     opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them.

     The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST,
     EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His
     WAIL a painful death cry.

     His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The
     impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS
     the Cab into a SPIN.

     SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into
     the road and keeps going.

     The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues
     pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some
     distance.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     Again they FIRE. A group of missiles darting out.


     GODZILLA

     The missiles HIT, ripping into him. Again GODZILLA
     SCREAMS out, his forward motion stopped.


276  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     276

     Where the blockade and angry mob still wait and watch in
     horror. The Cab SLIDES INTO A SPIN as it comes to a stop
     just in front of the crowd.

     Nick jumps out first, staring back at Godzilla. Audrey
     comes up from behind.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     His eyes rolling back into his head as he SCREAMS OUT.
     Slowly he TUMBLES.


     ANGLE - BRIDGE

     Godzilla's enormous head comes CRASHING DOWN in front of
     us. The tremendous impact sends TREMORS across the
     bridge.


277  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                 277

     The gathered crowd is ROCKED from the impact of the
     toppled Godzilla.


     GODZILLA

     His last breath escaping. Defeated and weary, his eyes
     blink slowly as we watch his life slip away.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and
     lifeless face.

     The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them
     begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously. The mob
     breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our
     heroes, surrounding them. Cheering enthusiastically.


278  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     278

     The room is going berserk, everyone slapping hands. Lucy
     turns and gives a "high-five" to everyone around her.


279  EXT. JERSEY SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT              279

     Cameras flash like mad. Several news crews fight their
     way through the crowd.

                            REPORTERS
                      (overlapping)
               How did you discover the nest? Dr.
               Tatopoulis, can you tell us what
               happened back there?

                            NICK
               Sorry, guys, I've promised my story as
               an exclusive to another reporter.

     Nick winks at Audrey. Caiman pushes his way through the
     crowd of reporters over to her.

                            CAIMAN
               We did it! We've got the exclusive!
               Way to go, Audrey!

                            AUDREY
               We? I don't think so.

                            CAIMAN
               I want that story, Audrey. Remember
               you work for me.

                            AUDREY
               Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.

     Audrey waves goodbye as Animal walks over, checking his
     camera and his coat pocket.

                            ANIMAL
               Audrey, did you take the tape out of
               the camera?

                            AUDREY
               No.

                            NICK
               Where's Raymond?

     They look around, but he's gone. Nowhere to be seen.

                            ANIMAL
               I couldn't have just lost it?

     A phone begins to RING. Nick checks his pockets and finds
     Raymond's cellular phone. Nick answers.

                            NICK
               Hello?

                            RAYMOND (O.S.)
               It's Raymond.

                            NICK
               Where are you?


280  EXT. PAY PHONE - DOWN THE BLOCK - SAME - NIGHT             280

     Raymond watches the mob scene from a distance.

                            RAYMOND
               Tell your friends I will send the tape
               after I remove a few items from it.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Nick nods to Audrey that it's Raymond.

                            NICK
               I understand.

                            RAYMOND
               I just wanted to say, au revoir and
               thank you for your help, my friend.

                            NICK
               Wait.
                      (line goes dead; to
                      himself)
               Au revoir.

                            AUDREY
               Who was that French guy, anyway.

                            NICK
               Oh, just some insurance guy.

     Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther
     and farther. We see the mob, the military, the command
     tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal
     Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.

                                             CUT TO:


281  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           281

     We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though
     we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the
     debris of the station into one of the tunnels.

     We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft
     of light up ahead. We move closer to it.

     As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's
     gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary
     egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. CRACK. IT
     OPENS.

                                             FADE OUT:


                              THE END

     FADE IN:

     An iguana...

     Crawling off its nest, leaving its eggs exposed.


  1  EXT. MORUROA ATOLL ISLANDS, FRENCH POLYNESIA - PACIFIC       1

     Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary
     footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick
     shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons
     all in their natural tropical environment.

     Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June
     1968

     Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a
     static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down
     in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the
     island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
     move about.

     Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
     nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.

     We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
     over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
     French government held in this tropical region.

     Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
     building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
     culminating in one final EXPLOSION.

     The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
     fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
     below.

     We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
     unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
     lizard's eggs.

     Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
     clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the
     eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE
     continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

                                             SMASH CUT TO:


  2  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT          2

     Smashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm
     we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker.

     Super: Pacific Ocean, present day


  3  INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT                             3

     We TRACK across the complicated computerized
     navigational console that is actually steering the
     immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.
     program playing.

     At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an
     overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
     satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.

     Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,
     the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
     the console.

     The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly
     toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a
     KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the
     radio/intercom.

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               Captain. This is the bridge. We have
               an emergency.


  4  INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT                   4

     Alarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters
     and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper
     decks.


  5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5

     The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the
     kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by.

                            COOK
                      (in Japanese)
               What's going on? What's happening?

     Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an
     enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense
     ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY.

     The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up
     nervously.


  6  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   6

     The CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the
     console.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               What was that!?

                            SKIPPER
                      (in Japanese)
               I can't tell...

     Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is
     HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain
     and Skipper to the floor.

     Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of
     our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in
     the Captain's eyes at the sound.


  7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7

     The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the
     horrible WAILING SOUND.

     Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something
     enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew
     members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.

     Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly
     filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the
     crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases
     them.


  8  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   8

     The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights
     and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls
     in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (in Japanese)
               Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
               lifeboats...

     But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS
     across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE
     GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.


  9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9

     The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out
     onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it
     violently.


     A TARP

     is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life
     boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
     tries to hoist them up and over the side.


     ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER

     Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the
     ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
     it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING
     INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.
     Could that have been a CLAW?


     THE CREW

     Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,
     several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against
     the ship.


     THE CLAW

     Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time
     the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.


     A LIFEBOAT

     Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following
     it is the Cook.

     Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing
     to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES
     something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets
     go of the railing.

     The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
     FLIPS OVER.

                                             CUT TO:


     WINDSHIELD WIPERS

     Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain
     doused windshield, DR. NIKO "NICK" TATOPOULOS. Music
     blares from the tiny headphones of his Walkman.

                            NICK
                      (singing)
               ...I'm singing in the rain, just
               singing in the rain...

 10  INT. RUSSIAN TOWN - RAIN - DAY                              10

     The utility van races through this small Russian town
     right past a roadblock marked with the international
     signs for "no trespass" and "nuclear radiation."

                            NICK
               ..."What a glorious feeling. I'm happy
               again..."

     As the van disappears down the road, we CRANE UP
     revealing a city sign reading: CHERNOBYL, RUSSIA.


 11  EXT. CHERNOBYL DIRT PARK - RAIN - DAY                       11

     With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
     distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
     field of dirt.

     Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van.
     He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
     cases.

     Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the
     cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an
     assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.

     Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll
     meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young
     and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily
     together.

     With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
     life. Inside one of the cases are several cables
     attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up
               above..."

     Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to
     SHOVE the spikes into the muddy earth.

                            NICK
               ..."The sun's in my heart and I'm
               ready for love..."

     Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the
     van and pops the hood.


     CLOSE - VAN'S ENGINE

     We SEE the steaming engine and a large electric car
     BATTERY.

                            NICK
               ..."Let the cloudy skies chase..."

     He attaches the cables to the battery and they SPARK!
     Nick YELPS and jumps back. Shaking off the shock, he
     rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his
     knees.

     Suddenly, raising from the mud we see DOZENS OF
     EARTHWORMS. Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
     jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in
     his element.

                            NICK
               ..."I'm singin' in the mud, just
               scooping up my worms..."

     Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an
     enormous RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTER lands right behind
     him.

     From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter,
     Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several RUSSIAN
     OFFICERS coming toward him. Nick scrambles to his feet.

                            NICK
                      (broken Russian)
               Good day. I am here with
               permission...I have a, a...
                      (in English)
               Permit. How do you say permit?

     He goes through his pockets looking for his permits.

                            MALE VOICE (O.S.)
               Dr. Nick Topopolosis?

     Tatopoulos looks up as the Russian soldiers move past
     him and over towards his cases of equipment. A man in a
     long raincoat comes forward.

                            NICK
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            TERRINGTON
               The worm guy, right?
                      (extending his hand as he
                      approaches)
               Kyle Terrington, U.S. State
               Department.

     The Russian soldiers close up his equipment and take it
     off to the Helicopter.

                            NICK
               What are they doing?

                            TERRINGTON
               You've been reassigned.

                            NICK
               You can't shut me down now! My
               research here's not finished!

                            TERRINGTON
               It is now.

 12  EXT. PAPEETE - TAHITI - STREET - DAY                        12

     Coastal town of Papeete, Tahiti. With the ocean in the
     distance, through the heat waves we SEE a row of
     official looking black sedans coming toward us.


 13  EXT. PAPEETE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                    13

     The doors to the sedans open as a group of very official
     looking Government types. Stopping to light his
     cigarette is PHILLIP RAYMOND, 40's, intense, dangerous
     and worst of all...French.


 14  INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                 14

     Raymond leads the official looking group down the hall.
     A BRIEFING OFFICER rushes over. (The following dialog is
     entirely in French with subtitles)

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               The Japanese consulate has been
               calling and we've been getting
               pressure from the Americans.

                            RAYMOND
               What did you tell them?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Nothing yet.

                            RAYMOND
               Are there any other survivors?

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
               Only one, Sir. He was very lucky.

     The group arrives at a door at the end of the hall. The
     Briefing Officer opens the door.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - THROUGH OPEN DOOR

     In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from
     the tanker curled up in the fetal position. The doctors
     and a few nurses are attending to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Get them out of there.

     Two of the Officials move in and escort the Doctors and
     Nurses out of the room. Raymond nods to two other
     Officials who begin to unpack some recording equipment,
     including a video camera.


 15  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME                                   15

     Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling
     down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The
     old Cook seems to be in a world of his own, rocking back
     and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes
     forward.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in French)
               Ask him what happened.

     The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old
     Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook
     seems to be in a world of his own.

                            BRIEFING OFFICER
                      (in English)
               It's no use. He's been like this since
               we fished him out of the ocean.
               Whatever happened to that tanker put
               him in a complete state of shock.

     Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high.
     The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed
     by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old
     Cook's face.

                            RAYMOND
                      (in English)
               What did you see, old man?

     Drawn out of himself by the flame...

                            OLD COOK
                      (weakly)
               Gojira...Gojira...

     Raymond shoots a look at the Second Official for an
     explanation.

                            SECOND OFFICIAL
                      (in English)
               I have no idea what he is saying.

                            OLD COOK
                      (stronger)
               ...Gojira!...Gojira!...GOJIRA!!

     A small sea plane flies over this jungle region of
     Panama, darting up the Gulf into the lush greenery of
     the countryside.

     Super: Guilfo de San Miguel, Panama - 45 km outside
     of La Paz

     Slowly the plane begins to descend, landing by a small
     village.


 17  EXT. VILLAGE FISHING DOCK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY             17

     Several soldiers unload Nick's cargo as he steps out of
     the plane onto the dock. As he walks towards shore he
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - POLICE BARRICADE

     Dozens of citizens as well as the press are gathered at
     a police barricade; their access to the village denied.
     Panamanian Police and U.S. military working together to
     keep people out.

     Marching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS,
     30's, efficient, who is spearheading this operation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Dr. Niko Topopolosis?

                            NICK
                      (correcting)
               It's Tatopoulos.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Right. The worm guy.
                      (to guards at blockade)
               Can someone get those people off the
               beach?

                            NICK
               Excuse me, would you mind telling me
               what the hell I'm doing here?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Follow me.

     The Major leads Nick up the beach away from the crowds.

                            NICK
               You didn't answer my question. In
               fact, for the last 18 hours no one has
               answered any of my questions.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We have a situation on our hands that
               requires your particular expertise.


     ANGLE - DESTROYED VILLAGE HUT

     Several soldiers and researchers are investigating the
     site when Nick and the Major walk past.

                            NICK
               Look, I may work for the Nuclear
               Regulatory Commission but accidents
               and spills are not my field.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We know.

     Major Hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade
     away from a jungle pathway. Major Hicks takes the
     pathway.

                            NICK
               Do you know that you just interrupted
               a three year study of the Chernobyl
               earthworm?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Yeah, you're the worm guy.

                            NICK
               The radioactive contamination in that
               area altered the earthworm's DNA! You
               have any idea what that means?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               No, but I have the feeling I'm about
               to find out.

                            NICK
               It means that due to a man made
               accident the Chernobyl earthworms are
               now over seventeen percent larger than
               they were before. Mutated by seventeen
               percent?

     Major Hicks stops, turns to Nick.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (bemused)
               Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.

                            NICK
               They're enormous! A new species
               created by man's recklessness. That's
               what I've been trying to tell you, I'm
               only a biologist. I take radioactive
               samples and study them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then you're perfect.
                      (pointing to the ground)
               Here's your radioactive sample. Study
               it.

     With that Major Hicks walks away.

                            NICK
               What sample?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're standing on it.

     Nick looks down, sees nothing.

                            NICK
               I don't see it.
                      (no response)
               Where is it?

     We CRANE UP above him, pulling back farther and farther,
     until we SEE he's standing inside of a 15 YARD LONG
     GIGANTIC FOOTPRINT in the sand.

                            NICK (CONT'D)
               I don't see it!

     Two scientists have spread out a tape measure to
     document its length as two others inspect it with Geiger
     counters. Nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a
     remarkable discovery. He looks up ahead and SEES...


     OVERHEAD TITLT SHOT - Foot steps...-

     Five gigantic footsteps in front of him. Other
     researchers examining the prints with all kinds of
     equipment. Geiger counters, CLICK, CLICKING away. Nick
     is stunned.


18   EXT. TATTERED VILLAGE REMAINS - MOMENTS LATER               18

     Nick rushes to catch up with Major Hicks who walks
     towards a command tent in the distance.

                            NICK
                      (flabbergasted)
               That was a footprint. I was standing
               inside a footprint.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's right.

                            NICK
               But there's no animal in the world
               that can make prints like that? Is
               there?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're hoping you're going to help us
               figure that out.

     The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being
     attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined
     for radiation. The village has been decimated.

                            NICK
               Somebody must have seen it.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               It happened so fast no one knew what
               hit them 'til is was over.

     A jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes
     rushing over with a video tape in his hands. As he passes
     Major Hicks...

                            PETERS
                      (on the run)
               Tape's in. The French finally released
               it.

     Peters takes off for the command' tent. Nick and the
     Major follow.


     COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

     Part military, part scientific command post. Lots of
     activity. Peters waves the tape as he rushes over to a
     television. Major Hicks and Nick follow.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               A tanker was attacked and sunk
               yesterday near the French Polynesians.
               We think there's a connection.

                            WOMAN SCIENTIST (ELSIE)
               Is that the tape of the witness?

     Excitedly, ELSIE CHAPMAN, heavy set, early 30's,
     paleontologist and head of the research team, leads
     several of her colleagues over to the t.v.

                            NICK
               Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...

                            ELSIE
               Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.

     She's clearly attracted to him. This doesn't escape
     Nick, who's not too comfortable with her flirtatious
     glare. She turns to a scientist standing next to her,
     DR. CLIVE CRAVEN.

                            ELSIE (CONT'D)
               Dr. Craven, have you met the worm
               guy?

                            DR. CRAVEN
               Nice to meet you.

     The t.v. turns on and we SEE the old Cook, rocking on
     his bed, repeating over and over the same word...

                            OLD COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...Gojira...

     This is all too overwhelming for him. He turns from the
     t.v. and looks out into the jungle.

     Slowly he walks away, staring at something in the
     distance with total awe. Elsie walks up next to him.

                            ELSIE
               What could have possibly done all
               that?

     We REVERSE ANGLE and SEE what they are staring at.

     A gigantic path cut through the jungle.

     Something of immense size has trampled and cut a deep
     and wide path right through the jungle forest that goes
     on for miles on end. Over the stunned face of Nick we
     HEAR...

                            OLD COOK (O.S.)

 19  INT. WNEW T.V. STATION - DAY                                19

     As we WIDEN we see this is one of several wall mounted
     monitors all showing channel WNEW. Through the glass
     doorway nearby we see CHARLES CAIMAN, 40's, handsome,
     entering the office.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Murray wants these copied to each
               field producer...


     ANGLE - SECRETARY DESK

     Standing in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early
     thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't
     toughened in the big city and talking with her
     co-worker, LUCY, sitting.

                            AUDREY
               And I'm supposed to remind you to call
               him on all of Caiman's expense
               p.o.'s.

                            LUCY
               Speak of the devil.

     Just then Caiman passes behind them.

                            AUDREY
                      (nervous)
               Think I should ask him? I'm going to
               ask him. You think I should? I will.

     Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman. Lucy
     rolls her eyes.

                            LUCY
               Oh girl...


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him.
     Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He
     can't.

                            AUDREY
               Did you talk with Humphries?

                            CAIMAN
               This is not the place...

                            AUDREY
               Just tell me, did you talk with him?

                            CAIMAN
               He said he'd consider it. It's between
               you and Rodriguez.

                            AUDREY
               Are you serious? He's going to
               consider me for he job? What else did
               he say?

     They arrive at his office. An enormous standee of
     himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there.

                            CAIMAN
               Why don't I tell you over dinner
               tonight? Your place.

     He stops at his door. Audrey is startled.

                            AUDREY
               Mr. Caiman, you're married.

                            CAIMAN
               And you're beautiful...

                            AUDREY
               Mr. Caiman...

                            CAIMAN
               Call me Charlie.

                            AUDREY
                      (stubbornly)
               Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra
               research for you after hours and
               weekends for nearly a year. And I've
               never asked for anything but this job
               is really important to me. I'm too old
               to be an assistant anymore. I need to
               know this job is going someplace.

                            CAIMAN
               So have dinner with me tonight.

                            AUDREY
               I can't.

                            CAIMAN
               It's your choice.

     Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to
     face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her
     chewing gum and plasters it on his nose.

 20  EXT. JAMAICAN HIGHWAY - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   20

     Over the bumpy Jamaican highway we FOLLOW from above
     several military jeeps racing in convoy.

     Super: Great Pedro Bluff, Jamaica


 21  INT. JEEP - SAME                                            21

     Elsie, Nick and Clive are cramped together along with
     Nick's equipment in the back of the jeep. Nick looks
     very uncomfortable. Elsie looks at Nick...lasciviously.

                            ELSIE
               Three years digging up worms in
               Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos
               handle it?

                            NICK
               Oh, I'm not married.

                            ELSIE
               Really? A girlfriend then?

                            NICK
               No. Perhaps I work too much.

                            ELSIE
                      (filtered)
               You mean to tell me that there is no
               one who holds a special place in your
               heart?

     Nick seems to get lost in thought.

                            NICK
               Not for a long time, now.

                            ELSIE
               Well, I think you're cute.

                            NICK
                      (awkward)
               Oh, thank you.
                      (whispered to Clive)
               Is she always like this?

                            CLIVE
                      (conspiratorially)
               I had to beat her off with a stick.

     The sound of a HELICOPTER ZOOMS overhead.

     A helicopter ZOOMS past our convoy. As we FOLLOW the
     helicopter we REVEAL...


     JAMAICAN BEACH WITH A BEACHED CARGO SHIP - DAY

     Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo
     ship lays on its side in the sand. Two gigantic holes,
     ripped into its hull.


     MILITARY JEEPS

     Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push
     past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a
     collective gasp as they see the ship for the first
     time.

     Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital)
     take measurements of the holes in the ship.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Who are they? Lieutenant, get those
               people away from there.

                            RAYMOND
                      (French accent)
               They are with me!

     Everyone in the group turns to find Mr. Phillip
     Raymond.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               And who are you?

     Raymond hands him, as well as anyone who wants one, his
     business card.

                            RAYMOND
               CHARGEURES, property and casualty
               insurance. We are preparing a report.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You're fast.

                            RAYMOND
               That is our job.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Well your people are getting in the
               way of my job.

                            RAYMOND
               Major, what do you think could have
               done this?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Get your people out of there or I
               will.

     The Major walks away. Raymond studies him as he does.


     ANGLE - SHIP

     Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the
     hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking
     radiation counts of the ship.

                            NICK
               Mind if I borrow this?

     Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the
     cracked hull of the ship.


 22  INT. CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                          22

     Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship
     are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets
     readings from all over the area. One particular spot,
     above him, seems slightly stronger.

     Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and
     puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like
     the ones from Chernobyl)

     Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp
     shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF
     REPTILE FLESH.

     He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it
     into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half,
     SOMETHING GIVES WAY.

     With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of
     water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front
     of him.

     Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body
     swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.

     The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all
     right.

                            PETERS
               You okay, Nick?

                            NICK
               Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...

     Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar
     is suddenly handed to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Are you looking for this?

                            NICK
               Thanks.

     Raymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


     UNDERWATER - NETS - MOVING P.O.V.

     We are moving very quickly underwater. Ahead of us are
     some large FISHING NETS with a catch of fish carried in
     the bunt. Quickly we are heading for a collision.


 23  EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - OFF NEW ENGLAND COAST - DAY           23

     A great day for fishing. Slicing through the water we
     SEE three New England Fishing TRAWLERS, the HARPO, the
     CHICO, and the GROUCHO.


 24  EXT. THE HARPO - SAME - DAY                                 24

     ARTHUR is at the wheel. Suddenly the engines WHINE as
     the ship begins to slow down. Surprised, Arthur checks
     his throttle.


 25  EXT. THE CHICO - SAME - DAY                                 25

     LEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE
     of their own ship.

                            LEONARD
               Jerry, why are we slowing down?

                            JERRY (O.S.)
               She's heavy in the bunt.

                            LEONARD
               That was fast.


 26  EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY                               26

     The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on
     his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to
     him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules
     slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.

                            DECK HAND
               The nets are full!

                            JULES
               Then bring 'em in!

                            DECK HAND
               We can't. She won't budge!

     Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship
     ROCKS.


     ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL

     Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon
     all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long
     beat.

                            ARTHUR
               What is going on?

     Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move
     BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS!

                            LEONARD
               She's going sternway!

                            FIRST MATE
               What the hell did we catch?

     The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS
     in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches
     begin to CRACK under the building pressure.

     The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards.
     Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto
     the decks of the ships.

                            JULES
               Cut us free! Cut the nets!

     The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs
     an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.

     Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are
     brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets.
     Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
     are dragged helplessly backwards.

                            ARTHUR
                      (screaming at his men)
               Cut the damned cables!


     A CABLE SNAPS!

     Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
     cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.


     ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!

     Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is
     freed.


     THE HARPO

     Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards,
     faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then
     suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN,
     dipping into the water.

     With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER
     WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is
     CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE
     SEA.

     For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just
     happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.

     Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out
     of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on
     its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves
     of Jules and Leonard don't.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


 27  EXT. CLOUDY SKIES - MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - DAY          27

     A storm is brewing ahead as this large Military
     Transport plane glides into view then BANKS away.


     PETRI DISH

     A small piece of Nick's SAMPLE is cut away and placed on
     a glass microscope slide.

                                             WIDE TO REVEAL:


 28  INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - SAME - DAY                  28

     Nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily
     unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his
     microscope, examining his specimen.

     Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to
     Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the
     plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their
     discussion.

                            SOLDIER
               Major, we just got a report of a
               fishing trawler going down. Exact
               position, forty seven degrees
               latitude, 67 longitude.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What makes you think it's related?

                            SOLDIER
               The trawler was pulled under.

     The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to
     a map where the other incidents have been marked. He
     traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits
     the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred
               miles off the American Eastern
               seaboard and we don't even know what
               it is.

                            ELSIE
               Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of
               enormous reptile the likes of which we
               haven't seen since the age of
               prehistoric dinosaurs.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               So where's been hiding the last sixty
               million years?

                            ELSIE
               The depth and breath of the ocean
               floor has barely been explored. His
               kind could have survived there
               completely undetected.

                            NICK (O.S.)
               What about the traces of radiation?

     Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding
     his loosely scribbled notes in his hand.

                            NICK
               The radiation is not an anomaly, it's
               the clue. This creature is far too
               unique on every level to be some lost
               dinosaur.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Don't tell me why it's not, tell me
               what the hell it is.

                            NICK
               What do we know? It was first sighted
               off the French Polynesian Pacific. An
               area that has been exposed to dozens
               of nuclear tests over the last thirty
               years.

                            ELSIE
               Hence the radiation.

                            NICK
               More than that. I believe this is a
               mutated aberration, a hybrid from the
               fall out in that region.

                            CLIVE
                      (sarcastic)
               Like your earthworms?

                            NICK
               Yes! We're looking at a completely
               incipient creature. The dawn of a new
               species. The first of its kind.

                                             CUT TO:


     OCEAN WATER

     Racing close to the ocean waters below, something DARK
     and ENORMOUS moves swiftly below the surface. We TILT UP
     from the raging tides up to REVEAL...


 29  EXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND - SKYLINE - RAIN - DAY                29

     A storm has arrived as rain moistens the city ahead.


 30  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     30

     Dripping wet, Audrey enters from the rain, removing her
     raincoat. She walks to a booth where Lucy and ANIMAL, a
     slovenly, Italian video cameraman is his mid-thirties,
     are taking their lunch break. Animal has two plates of
     food he cobbles down.

                            AUDREY
                      (sitting)
               My life sucks.

                            LUCY
               Oh, please, your life doesn't suck.
               His life sucks.

                            ANIMAL
                      (between chews)
               That's cuz I'm married to you.

                            LUCY
               Shut up. How can you eat like that?

                            ANIMAL
               Big bites.

                            AUDREY
               I can't believe he put the moves on
               me. After everything I've done for
               him.

                            LUCY
               He's scum! As far as he's concerned
               you're just a pair of breasts that
               talk.

                            ANIMAL
               I like that image.

                            AUDREY
               You know how I spent last weekend?
               Walking his damned dog.

                            LUCY
               I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a
               douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap,
               puke chunks...

                            ANIMAL
               Hey, hey! I'm eating here!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, you're too damned nice, that's
               your problem. Nice gets you nothin' in
               this town. You gotta be a killer to
               get ahead, you know what I'm sayin'?
               I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't
               got what it takes.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, you don't think that's true,
               do you?

                            ANIMAL
               Nice guys finish last. First rule of
               the jungle.

                            AUDREY
               Well, I can be tough if I want.

                            ANIMAL & LUCY
               Yeah, sure.

                            AUDREY
                      (seeing something)
               Oh my God!

     Everything turns to see what Audrey is looking at.
     Audrey gets up and rushes over to a television above the
     counter.

                            AUDREY
                      (excitedly)
               Turn that up, turn it up.

     The waitress does. On the t.v. plays the same news story
     we saw from before from Panama. This time we SEE Nick
     and Major Hicks walking on the beach.

                            AUDREY
               It's Nick! I know that guy. I know
               him!

                            LUCY
                      (unimpressed)
               Who is he?

                            AUDREY
               He was my college sweetie! Look at
               him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What
               the hell is he doing in Panama.


 31  EXT. NEW YORK FISH MARKET - BELOW JFK HIGHWAY - DAY         31

     Even in the rain doesn't keep people away. Buyers haggle
     with sellers. A large MARKET, truck loads of fish. No
     one seems to notice the river across from them...


     MOUTH OF THE EAST RIVER

     Enormous turbulence in the water. Slowly something
     begins to LIFT, sheets of water fall. Bursting out, the
     backside TALONS of the enormous reptile pierce through.
     The TAIL slices through the turbulence.

     Two ships anchored at dock begin to LIFT UPWARDS as the
     beast below them begins to rise.


     ANGLE FISH MARKET

     A groaning WAIL ROARS, echoing. The people of the fish
     market turn just in time to see...


     THE ANCHORED SHIPS

     Lifting impossibly into the air above the pier. Suddenly
     a TIDAL WAVE of water comes CRASHING down, flooding the
     fish market.


 32  INT. TRANSIT BUS - P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD - RAIN -       32
     DAY

     Through the swinging windshield wipers of the bus we see
     the JFK highway in front of us. Suddenly we see...


     AN ENORMOUS FOOT

     Comes crashing down atop JFK highway, crushing it. The
     TRANSIT BUS tumbles off the demolished highway.

     The man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH
     puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED
     IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the
     truck.

     He lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market
     stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a
     loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground
     nearby.


 33  EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - BUILDING STEPS - RAIN - DAY          33

     With a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him,
     the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of
     umbrellas.

                            MAYOR
               I'd like to thank you all for coming
               out on this beautiful New York City
               day.

     Some in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the
     sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the
     distance.

                            MAYOR
               When I came into office four years
               ago, people didn't think we could
               reduce crime and I did.


     ANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD

     leaning to the cop next to him.

                            COP
                      (sarcastic)
               Yeah, he did.

                            MAYOR
               People didn't think I could restore
               order...

     This time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder.

                            MAYOR
               ...and I did. The city is a safer
               place today...

     Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with
     fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly
     with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to
     CRUMBLE.

                            MAYOR
                      (to his aides)
               What the hell....

     People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the
     falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled
     inside by his security men.

     Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we
     SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris
     out of its way.


     SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT

     Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET
     of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and
     SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the
     beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast.

     After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the
     doorway to see the demolished street scene.

                            MAYOR
               What was that?


 34  INT. WNEW - CAIMAN'S OFFICE - SAME - DAY                    34

     Caiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some
     files. Rain and thunder continue outside.

                            CAIMAN
                      (into phone)
               I don't give a crap about some war in
               a country I can't pronounce. That's
               not a lead story. Find me a damned
               story, will ya!

     Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade
     SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING
     approaching. She turns and SEES...


     GIGANTIC TEETH

     The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by
     Caiman's office window.

                            SECRETARY
               Mr. Caiman. I think your story just
               walked by the window.

     Caiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused,
     she's dazed.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

     Just then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip.


 35  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     35

     Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying.

                            LUCY
               Did Romeo have a name?

                            AUDREY
               Nick Tatopoulos.

                            ANIMAL
               That why you dumped him?

                            AUDREY
               No! I just couldn't see myself with
               some boring egg head who spends his
               summer picking apart cockroaches. I
               wanted to have some adventure, some
               fun...

                            LUCY
               And now you live the glamorous life of
               Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch,
               ain't it?

     In the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching.

                            ANIMAL
               How long where you and dis guy goin'
               steady?

                            AUDREY
               Nearly four years...

                            LUCY
               Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he
               didn't ask you to marry him.

                            AUDREY
               That's the problem. He did.

     Suddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone
     in the diner reacts.

                            LUCY
               Tell me that's not another goddamned
               parade.

     The next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to
     fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in
     PANIC.

                            ANIMAL
               That's ain't no parade...

     Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING.
     Through the front window we SEE...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are
     SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW,
     shattering it.

     Animal uses his size to COVER the girls from the falling
     debris. As the danger passes, Animal charges for the
     door.

                            LUCY
               Victor, wait!


 36  EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - RAIN - DAY                       36

     Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced
     fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn. Animal
     goes over to his NEWS VAN that has been partially
     crushed.

     He pries open the rear door and takes out his video
     camera and takes off running. Audrey and Lucy arrive too
     late to stop him.

                            LUCY
               Victor, don't!


     ANIMAL RUNNING

     Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the
     debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera.
     It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...


     P.O.V. THE TAIL

     Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks
     ahead. Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small
     alleyway.


 37  EXT. OTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS                              37

     His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape
     inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts
     out into the street to get his shot.

     The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see,
     CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.

     Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire
     massive creature that is...


     GODZILLA

     as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is
     ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.

     Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in,
     sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light
     goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.


     P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA

     Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly
     covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about
     to come down directly on us.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh shit!

     Before he can do anything about it...


     GODZILLA'S FOOT

     Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the
     gargantuan foot SMASHES DOWN.

     In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing IN
     BETWEEN THE BEAST'S TOES. Abruptly the foot LIFTS
     again. Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear.


     ANGLE - ANIMAL

     Close on Animal as the endless TAIL of the creature
     DRAGS just past him. It seems to go on forever. Finally
     it disappears.


     WIDE ANGLE - TABLEAU OF A DEMOLISHED STREET

     Deserted and demolished. Cars burn, debris falls.
     Animal, the lone figure, just stands there, his chest
     heaving, hyper ventilating.

                                             CUT TO:


 38  EXT. NEW JERSEY STREETS - LOW ANGLE - AFTERNOON             38

     A military CONVOY with Police escort RACES past us.


     ABOVE - HELICOPTER SHOT - CONVOY

     Sirens BLARING, the convoy and escort speed onward.


 39  INT. MILITARY SEDAN - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SAME             39

     Just as they arrive at a military roadblock. Crowds have
     gathered as the military try to keep them at bay.


 40  EXT. NEW JERSEY SHORE - CLIFF SIDE - DAY                    40

     The guards let the convoy pass. The military is putting
     up a number of large tents. A SERGEANT moves over
     quickly to greet the team as they exit their vehicles.

                            SERGEANT
                      (quick salute)
               Sergeant O'Neal, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Any word from the Mayor's office?

     Just then dozens of NEWS VANS pull up. Reporters and
     camera crews come rushing toward them. The guards rush
     to intercept. Stepping out of the next car in the
     convoy, Nick and Elise join Major Hicks.

                            SERGEANT
               They've agreed to evacuate the city.
               They've called out the National Guard
               and riot police are on alert.

     As they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close.
     Nick and Elsie are overwhelmed.

                            ELSIE
                      (aside to Nick)
               Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three
               million people. Has that ever been
               done before?

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Several military guards have to clear a path for them as
     they enter the tents.


 41  INT. COMMAND TENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY                        41

     Still in construction. The team enters.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Status report?

                            SERGEANT
               We've lost sight of it, Sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You want to run that by me again?

                            SERGEANT
                      (nervous)
               After the initial attack he
               just...disappeared.

                            OFFICER
                      (interrupting)
               Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on
               the line.

     This takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he
     wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant.

                            NICK
               I don't understand. How can something
               that large just disappear?

                            SERGEANT
               We're not sure. We're scanning the
               area now.

                            ELSIE
               He probably returned to the river.
               Just like everywhere else we've been,
               we're always one step behind.

     Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open
     revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline.
     Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes.

                            NICK
               I don't think so.

     Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from
     the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city.
     Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.

                            NICK
               I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An
               island, water on all sides. But like
               no other island in the world, this is
               a place where he can easily hide.
                      (beat)
               He's in there someplace.

     A SOLDIER comes rushing in.

                            SOLDIER
               Channel eight caught it on film!

     He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On
     the screen we SEE the shaky video Animal took of the
     creature just as it was about to step on him.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...WNEW's exclusive images of the
               creature were taken less than a half
               hour ago.

     Nick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight
     of the immense creature.

                            CAIMAN
               Cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti
               barely survived this vicious attack to
               provide us with this footage.

     The sounds of applause lead us to...


 42  INT. WNEW BUILDING - SAME - DAY                             42

     Everyone is applauding as Animal, carrying crates of
     equipment, passes the t.v. playing the same news story.
     Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly.

                            CO-WORKERS
               Way to go Animal! That's my man!

     Animal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some
     files.

                            AUDREY
               Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you
               scared?

                            ANIMAL
               Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna
               kill me.

                            LUCY
               Damned right, you crazy Wop!

     We SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons
     of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break
     from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The
     station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously.

                            MURRAY
               People! We have to be completely
               relocated to the New Jersey station
               before our 5:30 broadcast.
                      (reading from list)
               Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're
               on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll
               see you in Jersey.

                            ANIMAL
               Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all
               right?

                            LUCY
               Audrey's going to stay with us
               tonight.

                            ANIMAL
               Great. See ya then.

     Animal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to
     packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay
     the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command
     tent.

                            FIELD REPORTER
                      (filtered)
               ...military and government health
               officials set up a command post on the
               New Jersey coast this afternoon...

     Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very
     excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end
     of the hall. She rushes over to him.

                            AUDREY
               Caiman, wait. Take me with you.

                            CAIMAN
               What?

                            AUDREY
               I've got something on this. I know a
               guy on the inside with the
               military...

                            CAIMAN
               Not now. You got my bag?

     Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the
     elevator.

                            AUDREY
               You don't understand, I can get us
               information...

                            CAIMAN
               Listen, this is the time when the big
               boys have to go to work, okay Honey?

     With that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed,
     Audrey just stares at him.

                            CAIMAN
               The bag?

     Audrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as
     the elevator doors close. Lucy walks over.

                            LUCY
               Come on, Girl, we've gotta go!


 43  EXT. WNEW OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER - DAY             43

     Lucy and Audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos
     that has taken over the city. Hundreds of people trying
     to leave at once. Gridlock.

     As they move into an overcrowded subway entrance,
     Audrey looks up just in time to SEE the WNEW NEWS
     HELICOPTER lifting off from the building behind them.

                                             CUT TO:


 44  EXT. MANHATTAN - HELICOPTER SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON           44

     We SEE the destroyed parts of downtown Manhattan. Police
     barricade the streets as firemen work to contain the
     fires.

                            CAIMAN (O.S.)
               ...in what city officials are calling
               the worst act of destruction since the
               World Trade Tower bombing...


 45  INT. WNEW NEW HELICOPTER - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON           45

     Caiman stares earnestly at his video camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Police and the National Guard have
               quarantined off over twenty square
               city blocks...


 46  EXT. OVERHEAD HELICOPTER SHOT OF MANHATTAN - SAME           46

     Below we see the largest traffic jam in the history of
     the city. Police and National Guardsmen guide the
     traffic.

                            CAIMAN
               ...hundreds of thousands have jammed
               the streets in the largest evacuation
               in the history of the city. And many
               people are not happy about it.


 47  EXT. MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEW - VIDEO FOOTAGE            47

     Quick cuts of people who where interviewed earlier.

                            WOMAN
               I don't understand why we have to
               leave our homes. It's over already,
               isn't it?

                            MAN
               What are we running from? A big
               lizard? I've got cockroaches in my
               building that could kick the crap out
               of it.


 48  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - GRIDLOCK - LATE AFTERNOON               48

     Near chaos as police and National guardsmen attempt to
     bring order to the hundreds of honking, screaming
     motorists.


     RIOT POLICE VAN

     Dozens of armed officers pile out of the van.


     NATIONAL GUARDSMEN

     Maintaining blockades in front of their military
     vehicles.


 49  EXT. SEVENTH AVE E - ROADBLOCK - LATER AFTERNOON            49

     The evacuation effort is made more difficult as traffic
     must be diverted away from the quarantined destruction
     area ahead. Police block the street, smoldering
     buildings behind them. The detour only makes things
     worse.


 50  EXT. CITY BANK BUILDING - WALL STREET - SAME                50

     Several National Guardsmen walk up to the City Bank
     building where they find an ENORMOUS HOLE smashed into
     the side of the building. The Guardsmen peek inside.


     GUARDSMEN'S P.O.V. - INTO BUILDING

     We SEE THROUGH the building to a hold on the other side.
     Godzilla apparently walked RIGHT THROUGH. The Guardsmen
     are visibly shaken.


 51  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME                                  51

     Way beyond capacity, the flooded subway platform bursts
     with people pushing and shoving to get into the trains.
     Caught in the craziness we find Audrey and Lucy trying
     desperately to get on board.

                            P.A.
               Please don't push. People are getting
               shoved down onto the tracks and the
               trains can't leave...

     The last to fit inside, Lucy and Audrey cram in just as
     the doors shut behind them. People left behind BANG on
     the closed doors as the subway pulls out.


 52  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - SAME      52

     A gigantic traffic back up all the way down the Westside
     Highway. The bridge is a veritable parking lot.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
               Well this is great!


 53  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATER AFTERNOON                   53

     With his close aides in tow, the Mayor stares at the
     melee below.

                            MAYOR
               If we're wrong on this evacuation
               they'll string me up from the Liberty
               torch.


 54  EXT. COMMAND CENTER - JERSEY CLIFF SIDE - LATE              54
     AFTERNOON

     The Mayor's helicopter sails over the George Washington
     Bridge and over to a small landing pad near the Command
     Center. A large group of people dressed in business
     suits await the helicopter.


 55  INT. MAYOR'S HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON                    55

     Just as the helicopter is landing, the crowd moves
     toward the chopper.

                            MAYOR
               Who the hell are they?

                            AIDE
               It's a contingent of building owners
               and community business
               representatives.

                            MAYOR
               I don't have time for this nonsense.

                            AIDE
               Most of them are campaign
               contributors.

     Well that's a different story.


 56  EXT. LANDING PAD - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON              56

     As the Mayor steps out he's greeted by a nervous crowd
     of people shouting, "How long do we have to shut our
     business down? Will the city cover the damages? Etc."
     Among them, DONALD TRUMP tries to get the Mayor's
     attention.

                            MAYOR
               I share your concerns. I want to get
               the city back in business as soon as
               possible.

     As he pushes through the dense crowd he runs directly
     into...


     RAYMOND

     Who waits for the Mayor. The Mayor is momentarily
     stopped.

                            RAYMOND
                      (handing his card)
               CHARGURES Insurance. We represent
               nearly thirteen percent of the
               buildings in your city.

                            MAYOR
               If you'll excuse me...

                            RAYMOND
               We are very happy that you are in
               control of this situation.

     With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving
     a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's
     collar.

                            RAYMOND
               You can count on our emotional and
               financial support.

                            MAYOR
               Oh, well, thank you very much.

     Briskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through
     the crowd. Raymond watches him pass, seeing the device
     stuck to the Mayor's collar.


     ANGLE - WNEW NEWS CHOPPER

     Rushing over from the parked news chopper, Animal and
     Caiman race for the Mayor who walks through a mob of
     reporters.

                            CAIMAN
               Hurry, we're going to miss the Mayor.

     But before he can get close, two POLICE OFFICERS stop
     them.

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Sorry, you gotta have a press ID past
               this point.

                            CAIMAN
               Don't you watch t.v.?

                            POLICE OFFICER
               Can we see your press pass, sir?

     Flustered, Caiman searches his pockets for his press
     pass.

                            CAIMAN
               I had one here on my bag. Where the
               hell did I put it?


     CAIMAN'S PRESS PASS - ECU

     We SEE Caiman's plastic smile on his press ID. Suddenly
     AUDREY'S picture is placed on top of Caiman's.

                                             WIDEN TO
                                             REVEAL:


 57  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON                57

     Smashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with
     Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his.

                            LUCY
               What the hell are you doing?

                            AUDREY
               Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?

                            LUCY
               Your old sweetheart?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well he just turned up in New
               Jersey at the military command post.
               Somehow all this is related to what
               happened down in Panama. There's a
               story here. I know it. You got any
               tape or glue?

                            LUCY
               I left my forgery kit back at the
               office.

     Audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding
     his backpack, a RULER sticking out of the back.

                            AUDREY
               Hey, do you have any glue in your
               bag?

                            KID
               What's it to you?

                            AUDREY
               Can I use some?

                            KID
               What do I get?

                            AUDREY
               The warm feeling of helping your
               fellow man.

                            KID
               Five bucks.

                            AUDREY
               You're kidding, right?

     The Kid simply puts his hand out.


 58  EXT. NEW JERSEY TRAIN STATION - LATER                       58

     People FLOOD off the train out into the station.

                            P.A. ANNOUNCER
               Please exit the station. For those of
               you without accommodations, the city
               has opened up shelters on Monroe and
               60th and at Bergenline and 72nd.
               Please exit the...

     Audrey and Lucy walk through the crowd. Audrey turns and
     gives Lucy a kiss.

                            AUDREY
               Wish me luck!

                            LUCY
               Audrey, I don't think this is a very
               good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll
               have your job.

                            AUDREY
               I'm tired of waiting for someone else
               to give me an opportunity, Luce. If
               there's a story here I'm going to find
               it.

     Lucy nods in acceptance as Audrey disappears into the
     dense crowd. Lucy worries for her friend.

                                             CUT TO:


     "YUM YUM DOUGHNUTS" BAG - PRE-SUNSET

     Carried along with a Styrofoam cup of coffee. We WIDEN
     TO REVEAL a MAN carrying the junk food to a GREY VAN
     parked not too far from the Command Center Tent across
     the way.

     The man knocks on the back of the van. The van opens to
     reveal...


 59  INT. RAYMOND'S VAN - PRE-SUNSET                             59

     Filled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and
     his men are listening in to a conversation. The man with
     junk food hands it to Raymond.

                            RAYMOND
               Merci.

     He opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites
     into it and grimaces. To wash away the taste, he drinks
     from the coffee. It's worse than the croissant.

                            RAYMOND
               You call this coffee?

                            MAN
                      (French accent)
               I call this America.

     The man takes a seat near Raymond as Raymond turns up
     the volume on his headset.

                            MAYOR (O.S.)
                      (mid argument)
               You're telling me that in an election
               month I've evacuated the entire city
               for nothing?


 60  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM (TENT) - PRE-SUNSET            60

     From behind the Mayor's head we SEE the monitoring
     device attracted to his collar. As he speaks we WIDEN TO
     REVEAL...

                            MAYOR
               Do you realize what this evacuation
               will cost the people of this city!?

     Representatives of all branches of the military,
     National Guard and the Mayor's office are here. The room
     overflows with people. Nick, Elsie and the scientist
     stand near the back of the tent.

                            ADMIRAL PHELPS
               We're been monitoring the waters
               around the island. As far as we can
               tell it hasn't left the area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We think there's a strong reason to
               believe it may be hiding inside one of
               the buildings within the sequestered
               area.

                            MAYOR
               But you don't know for sure!

     Just then Sergeant O'Neal enters hurriedly. He wants to
     speak but waits for the opportunity.

                            MAJOR
                      (controlling his temper)
               Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those
               buildings then we give the all clear.
               But not until we've checked each
               building!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Sir, that may be more difficult than
               we originally projected.

                            MAJOR
               More good news?!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               We've run into a problem.

                                             CUT TO:


     A SIGN READING: SUBWAY STATION: 23RD STREET - SUNSET

     We CRANE DOWN to reveal several military sedans pulling
     up into FLAT IRON SQUARE (where Broadway meets 5th).
     Sergeant O'Neal leads the team out of the cars and down
     a subway entrance.


 61  INT. SUBWAY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS - SUNSET                 61

     Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very
     large subway station. For all we see it seems like a
     normal subway station except for the fact that every one
     of the team members look ASTONISHED.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Lt. Anderson and his men found this
               late this afternoon.

     The camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we
     suddenly SEE what the team is staring at...


     AN ENORMOUS HOLE

     The four normal subway tunnels have been CARVED OUT
     making one GIGANTIC TUNNEL. Debris and crumbled brick
     are everywhere. Several SOLDIERS with flashlights
     approach the hole.

     Lt. Anderson moves over to the astonished group. Some of
     the scientists fan out, examining the area.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               We were checking the office building
               above when we discovered the floor was
               gone.


     LOW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HOLE IN THE CEILING

     We SEE that not only is the ceiling gone but the
     building above is hollowed and torn to shreds. Another
     hole in the building leads to the street.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               When we learned he could burrow his
               way through the tunnels we realized he
               could be out of the quarantined zone.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
               island?

                            LT. ANDERSON
               Only five, Sir. We've checked them
               all. He hasn't used any of them.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Have them sealed off.

                            LT. ANDERSON
               And how should we do that, Sir?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fill them with cement, brick them up,
               put land mines in them, bombs, I don't
               know, just make sure that goddamned
               thing doesn't leave the island!


     ANGLE - INSIDE DARKENED TUNNEL

     As the SOLDIERS slowly move down deeper into the
     tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area. Could
     they stumble onto something dangerous?


     ANGLE - NICK

     as he approaches Major Hicks and Sergeant O'Neal.

                            NICK
               You know, he's not an enemy trying to
               evade you. He's just an animal.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What are you suggesting?

                            NICK
               When I needed to catch earthworms, I
               knew the best way to catch them was
               not to chase them. I had to draw them
               out.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling
     these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant.


     BACK TO TEAM

     Nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into
     the dark tunnel.

                            NICK
               All we need to do is find out what it
               wants, what it needs, and he'll come
               to us.


     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS

     The lead Soldier SEES something. Cautiously he moves
     forward thinking he's onto something. We HEAR something
     MOVING in the darkness.

     We FOLLOW his beam as the noise grows clearer. The beam
     falls onto something on the floor...


     A FISH

     Flopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam
     moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead.

                                             CUT TO:


 62  EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - POST-SUNSET (MAGIC HOUR)        62

     A battalion of armored TANKS roll down this deserted
     city street. A large number of GROUND TROOPS march
     behind.


     COBRA HELICOPTERS - SAME - MAGIC HOUR

     Banking in formation, the helicopters swerve, heading
     towards mid-town Manhattan.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION

     Soldiers pile up sand bags, creating a make shift
     fortification. SHARP SHOOTERS and a BAZOOKA BRIGADE
     settle into place.


 63  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   63

     Major Hicks moves over to a jeep and grabs the radio.


 64  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       64

     Major Hicks sits by a bank of communications
     technicians.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Where are they now?

                            RADIO TECHNICIAN
               Delta niner, what is convoy position?


 65  EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    65

     Led by armored military vehicles we SEE a convoy of
     TWENTY YELLOW DUMP TRUCKS passing over the bridge.

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
               Command, we're just entering the
               city.


 66  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME              66

     Sergeant O'Neal listens to the response on the radio.

                            RADIO TECHNICIAN
               Convoy ETA, five minutes.

     The Sergeant signals several military technicians, who
     are mounting several video cameras to hurry.


 67  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       67

     A buzz of activity. Military Officials and personnel.
     The Mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the
     room.

                            MAYOR
                      (whispering to Aide)
               They find anything yet?

     The Aide shakes his head. Monitors come to life with a
     live video feed-from several cameras we saw mounted.


     A CABLE REPAIRMAN - MAGIC HOUR

     In blue overalls, the REPAIRMAN walks up to a large
     satellite dish. We WIDEN to REVEAL the dish is parked
     next to the Command Tent. He kneels down next to some
     cables leading away from the dish toward the Command
     Tent.


 68  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAGIC HOUR                              68

     Suddenly all the screens FUZZ OUT. Just as quickly the
     monitors return to normal. No one seems to notice.


 69  EXT. SATELLITE DISH - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                     69

     The Repairman finishes affixing a small DEVICE to the
     cable. He taps his earpiece and speaks into his own
     lapel.

                            REPAIRMAN
                      (French accent)
               It is good.


 70  INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                         70

     We SEE Raymond and his men have turned this dingy Motel
     room into a command central of their own. Raymond is
     putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors
     turn on. They are seeing THE SAME VIDEO FEED as the
     Mayor. Pleased, he takes a sip. It's awful.

                            RAYMOND
               You said this was French Roast!

     His aid turns, holding a package labeled FRENCH ROAST.

                            RAYMOND
                      (defeated)
               More cream.

     His associate hands him some milk. He adds it to the
     coffee. No use, it still sucks. On the monitors we SEE
     the DUMP TRUCKS entering Flat Iron Square.


 71  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   71

     The DUMP TRUCKS arrive and the soldiers guide the
     trucks, forming a circle, their tails facing each other.
     As the last one passes it REVEALS Nick and Sergeant
     O'Neal.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I sure hope your plan works.

                            NICK
               I'm kind of hoping the same thing.

     The twenty of them, in concert, begin to dump their
     cargo.


     LOW ANGLE - CENTER OF THE DUMP TRUCK CIRCLE

     Tons and tons of FISH are DUMPED directly on top of us.


 72  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    72

     On the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish
     get dumped into a large pile in the center of Flat Iron
     Square.

                            AIDE
               Tres bizarre.

                            RAYMOND
               No.
                      (leaning forward)
               Very clever.


 73  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - FISH PILE - SAME - NIGHT            73

     A MOUNTAIN OF FISH have been piled into the center of
     Flat Iron Square.

                            NICK
               That's a lot of fish.

     A master of the obvious. Sergeant O'Neal shoots him a
     glare and moves over to the men. Together they march
     into a building at the edge of the square.


     SOLDIERS

     Loading up rifles, taking positions. GAS MASKS being
     handed out down a long line for all the soldiers.

     The TANKS move into their final positions. The National
     Guardsmen and Soldiers supporting the Tanks take
     positions.


 74  EXT. TOP OF THE SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       74

     Entering from the stairs out onto the roof, Sergeant
     O'Neal and his men take positions, observing from
     above.

     Everyone is waiting. The silence is deafening.


     ANGLE - NICK

     As everyone waits, Nick scans the area, thinking.
     Suddenly something catches his eye...


     STEAM VENT

     Through a steam vent in the streets. Nick sees STEAM
     lifting into the air. He notices several other vents
     doing the same thing around the square. Quickly Nick
     rushes over to a YOUNG OFFICER.

                            NICK
               I need your radio.

     The Young Officer leads Nick over to his jeep. Nick
     grabs the receiver.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal, the subway vents. We
               have to shut them down...


 75  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               75

     O'Neal listens to Nick on his radio.

                      (filtered)
               ...With the air pressure pushing up,
               he'll never smell the bait!

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (turning to soldier)
               Get some men down into those air
               vents. Shut 'em down!


 76  INT. SUBTERRANEAN AIR VENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT          76

     With a loud WHINE we HEAR the vents shutting down. The
     large whirling FAN BLADES slow to a stop.


 77  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME                                77

     One by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the
     vents are turned off. There is a long tense moment of
     waiting. When will it come? Will it come?

     Before the Young Officer can stop him, Nick rushes over
     to a manhole cover in the center of the street. The
     cover is to heavy. He yells back.

                            NICK
               We need to open all the manhole covers
               in the area. Let the scent waft down.

     The Young Officer signals other soldiers. Nick steps
     back and lets the soldiers go to work. As he walks back,
     he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection
     down a side street. He runs over to it.


     ANGLE - SIDE STREET - MANHOLE COVER

     A particularly heavy one in the center of this
     intersection (a block away from Flat Iron Square), Nick,
     alone, wrestles to remove it. With all his might, he
     drags it clear.

     Suddenly, through the hole he HEARS some STRANGE NOISES
     from below. Rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole.
     The NOISES grow increasingly louder.

     Then with a DEAFENING ROAR, the ground behind Nick
     ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as
     he does.

     Nick SPINS only to find himself face to face with the
     gigantic creature. Godzilla's head slopes down,
     apparently looking Nick in the eye.

     All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder
     hoisted rocket launchers prepared.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this. He
     gently signals with his hands that they should NOT fire.

     Sensing no danger from Nick, Godzilla simply STEPS OVER
     Nick.


     NICK'S POV - UNDER GODZILLA

     As the gargantuan creature walks over us, making a
     beeline for the fish.

     Nick turns and RUNS, following him.


 78  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                  78

     Godzilla moves into the square. The military hunkers
     down, ready to strike. Cautiously the beast moves over
     to the mountain of fish.


 79  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                    79

     Major Hicks watches the monitors as Godzilla approaches
     the fish.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Commence phase one. Let's gas it!


 80  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               80

     Everyone on the rooftop puts on their GAS MASKS.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Let 'em fly!


     ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - SAME

     All the soldiers PUT ON their GAS MASKS. A team of
     EIGHT, pull out a GAS CANISTERS and yank the releases.
     They DROP them down the long barrels of air cannons,
     preparing to fire.


     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION - SAME

     Nick runs past the fortification, trying to get a closer
     look. The Young Officer yells after him.

                            YOUNG OFFICER
               Where're you going? Nick!

     Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer TOSSES a gas
     mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a
     closer spot. Suddenly SAILING OVER HIS HEAD we SEE...


     GAS CANISTERS

     Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak
     across the sky landing behind Godzilla. The Yellow gas
     forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards.


     ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER

     Across the way eight MORE CANISTERS are FIRED at the
     beast. Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes.


     ANGLE - NICK

     Frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he
     DASHES forward over to a large BRONZE STATUE.


     GODZILLA

     The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins,
     his tail waving the smoke away. But the smoke returns.
     Godzilla YELLS OUT. Frustrated he rears back and
     BLASTS!

     For the first time we SEE the infamous POWER BREATH of
     Godzilla. With amazing FORCE the smoke, canisters, cars
     and anything that isn't nailed down SAILS BACKWARDS from
     the intense pressure.

     Nick is HIT by the WAVE of air pressure and is sent
     FLYING BACKWARDS, impossibly high in the air.

     An enormous fabric BANNER advertising this season at the
     MET, catches Nick who SLIDES down the banner, hitting
     the ground, HARD. Just as he looks up he SEES...


     A LARGE TRUCK

     Tumbling toward him from the power breath. Nick
     SCRAMBLES to his feet just in time as the rolling Truck
     SMASHES into the building behind where he just sat.


     ANGLE - TROOPS - FORTIFICATION

     The troops have to SCATTER as the tumbling trucks and
     cars are FLUNG AT THEM, disabling their attack forces.
     Trucks and rocket launches are CRUSHED by the tumbling
     debris.

     Godzilla CONTINUES to BLOW at everything around him.
     Cars and trucks ROLLING. Soldiers DIVING for cover. It's
     chaos.

     The glass in all the surrounding buildings SHATTER,
     shards of glass raining down. Windows, street lamps, all
     blown out by the tremendous gale force winds.


 81  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              81

     On the monitors we SEE the melee.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Fire at will!


 82  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               82

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will. Fire at will.


 83  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        83

     From all angles, soldiers rush back to their equipment
     and attempt to FIRE. Very few are able to get off
     rounds.


 84  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME - NIGHT                                 84

     O'Neal tries to steady himself as the soldiers FIRE down
     at the creature below. One HOISTS a MISSILE launcher.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA - NIGHT

     As the FIREPOWER begins around Godzilla, he takes a hit
     in the shoulder and SCREAMS OUT. Suddenly he LEAPS away
     just as several MISSLES HIT the Flat Iron Building
     behind where Godzilla was standing only moments
     earlier.

     Dashing down a side street, Godzilla LEAPS over the
     waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time.
     WE'VE NEVER SEEM HIM MOVE THIS QUICKLY. Several tanks
     are SQUASHED as the beast bull dozes right through the
     regiment.


 85  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            85

     We SEE the Flat Iron Building crumbling on one of the
     monitors near Major Hicks. In the rear of the room the
     Mayor looks sick.


 86  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        86

     Soldiers come out from behind the crashed vehicles and
     debris. Only the smoldering devastation is left behind.


 87  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              87

     The monitors only show static or devastation.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               O'Neal, what the hell is going on
               there!?


 88  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME                                         88

     Quickly his men are packing up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               He's gone, Sir. Echo division's in
               pursuit.


 89  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS (6TH AVE.) - SAME - NIGHT       89

     Four ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES come SKIDDING around the
     corner in hot pursuit. Each with a team manning enormous
     mounted weaponry.


     REVERSE ANGLE - 6TH AVE. - GODZILLA

     Galloping like a Gisele uptown, Godzilla is SPEEDING up
     the boulevard. The armored vehicles OPEN FIRE. Some
     shots CLIP into Godzilla's back. Ahead he is running
     directly into...


     MOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS

     Blocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE.
     Pinned down, the creature SCREAMS and DUCKS away down
     another side street. The missiles can't turn fast enough
     and SLAM into a building, DEMOLISHING it.


 90  EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - SAME - NIGHT                       90

     The window is SMASHED in. A small group of LOOTERS are
     loading up their mini-van. Finishing up the group is
     about to leave.

                            LOOTER #1
               Jimmy, let's go.

                            LOOTER #2
               Wait. I want this. Help me!

     The group rejoins Jimmy as they try to pull an enormous
     Pin Ball machine from the window. As they carry the
     machine back towards the mini-van...


     SQUASH! - GIGANTIC FOOT

     Godzilla's enormous foot flattens the mini-van like a
     pancake. The Looters go pale. As the Military Armored
     Vehicles RACE by in hot pursuit.


 91  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME - NIGHT                                91

     Godzilla BOUNDS onto Broadway and FREEZES, looking
     around. As he looks downtown he SEES...


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - MILITARY ARMORED VEHICLES

     Skidding around the corner a few blocks back, the
     armored vehicles reappear.

     Godzilla turns uptown and BOLTS. As he gets up to full
     speed...


     COBRA HELICOPTERS

     A team of FOUR COBRA HELICOPTERS swoops down heading
     directly for Godzilla.


 92  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - NIGHT                     92

     The Mayor stands over a Radio technician.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
                      (filtered)
               We have him, locked on.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Then FIRE damn it!


 93  EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                            93

     Godzilla runs into the famous lighted square (looking
     remarkably like Tokyo) just as the COBRA'S come SWEEPING
     DOWN out of the sky.

     Godzilla SPOTS them and leaps away just as they FIRE
     missiles, which RIP INTO the famous JUMBO TRON VIDEO
     BILLBOARD, demolishing the building.

     The Cobra's SWERVE quickly, pursuing Godzilla down a
     side street.


 94  EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                        94

     Godzilla appears, turning the corner and racing down the
     street. From behind, the Cobra helicopters come
     SCREAMING down on him, they FIRE ROCKETS at Godzilla
     who, again, deftly turns a corner.

     The errant rockets BLAST into the CHRYSLER BUILDING, as
     they attempt to follow him but fail. Shards of glass come
     RAINING DOWN as the building crumbles.


     ANGLE - ARMORED VEHICLES

     As they race around the corner they SLAM ON THE BREAKS
     just as the familier CONE of the Chrysler building comes
     CRASHING DOWN just inches in front of the vehicles,
     tumbling into the street.


 95  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            95

     The static increases over the radio.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT
                      (filtered)
               That is a negative impact.

     The Mayor, in the back of the room stands, furious.

                            MAYOR
               Negative impact!?! It's the goddamned
               Chrysler building, that's what it is!

     His aides try to calm him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               You said he was locked on!


 96  EXT. SIDE STREET - COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - NIGHT          96

     Moving through the narrow side street.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT (O.S.)
               The heat seekers can't lock. He's
               colder than the buildings around him.


 97  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                        97

     The four Cobra helicopters ZOOM around the corner and
     into 5th avenue.


     COBRA HELICOPTER P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Godzilla is ahead of us. The choppers FIRE again, this
     time using their gun turrets, ACCELERATING toward the
     beast.

     Under heavy bullet firepower and the choppers nearly on
     top of him, Godzilla DIVES into an office building.

     The helicopters surround the crumbling building, and
     OPEN FIRE, decimating it. They STOP firing and stare
     into the smoldering mess they've made.

                            PILOT
               I think we got him.

     Just then ERUPTING out of a building behind them...


     GODZILLA

     POUNCES OUT of the building, snapping up two of the
     helicopters in one bite!

     He WHIRLS around and SWIPES another out of the air with
     his ENORMOUS CLAW. The CLAWED helicopter SLAMS into the
     ground just as...


     ARMORED VEHICLES

     come sliding around the corner, directly into the
     CRASHING HELICOPTER which explodes on impact. The entire
     team is taken out with the concussion.


 98  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              98

     Major Hicks is on his feet, steaming mad.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Echo four, where is he!?


 99  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS - SAME - NIGHT                  99

     As the remaining Cobra helicopter SWERVES around,
     Godzilla is gone.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
               I don't know sir. He just vanished.

     As the helicopter PASSES a dark building we SEE a SHAPE
     MOVE! We realize that like a chameleon, Godzilla had
     TAKEN THE COLOR of the building and hid. With the
     helicopter past him, he CHASES FROM THE REAR.

                            HELICOPTER PILOT #4
                      (realizing)
               Oh Jesus!

     The chopper GUNS IT, full throttle. Godzilla GIVES
     CHASE. Even at its top speed it can't out run the big
     creature.

     The chopper tries to LIFT AWAY but before he can get the
     height, Godzilla SNAPS his gigantic jaws and SWALLOWS
     THE HELICOPTER WHOLE.


     STREET - WIDE ANGLE

     The fires burn and the rubble crumbles. Godzilla gives
     one final SCREAM and DIVES into a building,
     disappearing.


100  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           100

     The Major's aide try to hold him back as the Mayor is
     charging at Major Hicks.

                            MAYOR
               What the hell is the matter with you
               people?! You caused more damage than
               that thing did!


101  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                             101

     Empty and devastated. Fires continue to burn.


102  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       102

     Nick, Sergeant O'Neal and several of his men walk
     through the devastated area. Nick kneels down and
     SEES...


     NICK'S P.O.V. - PUDDLE OF BLOOD

     There is a large reddish brown puddle of blood. Nick
     takes out a small glass container and scoops some up.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               I can't believe it. He did all this
               and we did nothing to him.

     Nick walks over to him, consoling.

                            NICK
               That's not true. We fed him.


     REVERSE ANGLE

     Only a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of
     fish once was. Our team stands there amidst the rubble.

     FADE IN:


103  INT. NETWORK NEWS DESK - VIDEO FOOTAGE                     103

     A network news ANCHOR speaks directly at us as a video
     of the Chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind
     him.

                            ANCHOR
               While it may have looked like Beirut,
               it was in fact, Manhattan where man
               and nature have collided with brute
               force.

     The video switches to the White House where we SEE the
     President signing a bill.

                            ANCHOR
               The President today declared a state
               of emergency and has issued disaster
               relief funds to New York City.

104  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - VIDEO FEEDS - SAME - NIGHT          104

     We SEE that we've been watching the video on one of MANY
     video monitors showing all the news broadcasts. As an
     assistant moves away from the monitors we FOLLOW him out
     of the truck.


105  EXT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS - SAME - NIGHT           105

     We continue to FOLLOW the assistant outside, revealing
     the enormous MOB of reporters that have gathered just
     outside the military command tents. As we FOLLOW the
     assistant he passes several reporters doing "stand-up"
     reports.

                            REPORTER #1
               ...rumors continue to mount as to the
               origin of this, perhaps, lost
               dinosaur...

                            REPORTER #2
               ...having shut down the United Nations
               in the evacuation, foreign diplomats
               are demanding an international
               coalition be assembled to track the
               creature...

     The assistant finally arrives at Caiman who is doing a
     live remote. Animal works the camera.

                            CAIMAN
               ...Maintaining a total media blackout,
               officials remain silent this evening
               as to their progress in containing
               this creature...

     Behind him, in the crowd we SEE Audrey pushing her way
     through the reporters, her fake ID pinned on her shirt.
     She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and
     moves deeper into the crowds.

     Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their
     collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up
     nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening.

     The cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents
     as the reporters MOB the first car in line.


106  INT. SEDAN - NICK - NIGHT                                  106

     Nick observes the chaos. Through the crowd he SEES a
     Pharmacy, a neon sign reading: Never Closes. He looks
     back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and
     gets an idea.

                            NICK
                      (to the driver)
               It's okay, I'll get out here.

     He opens the car door and pushes his way through the
     crowds who are less interested in him as they are the
     military officials.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT

     Pushing his way through, Nick SEES what a circus this
     has become; t.v. news camera crews, journalists,
     concerned citizens, worried mothers, and of course,
     merchandising...


     STREET STANDS

     Nick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys,
     copies of Animal's now famous news video clip and, of
     course, tee shirts with still images from that same
     clip.


     ANGLE - AUDREY

     Through the dense crowd, Audrey SEES Nick in the
     distance. Excited she starts to push her way through.


107  INT. PHARMACY - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT                      107

     Ringing the night bell, Nick calls for the PHARMACIST
     who enters, weary eyed.

                            PHARMACIST
               Can I help you, young man?

                            NICK
               Do you have any home pregnancy tests?
               Especially ones that test for
               catastrophic hormones or clomiphene
               citrate.

                            PHARMACIST
               This is all we've got.

     The Pharmacist puts onto the counter six different off
     the shelf home pregnancy tests.

                            NICK
               I'll take them all.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               You must have quite some harem.

     Nick spins to find Audrey standing right behind him.
     Embarrassed, Nick awkwardly pays for the tests.

                            NICK
               Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You
               look, wow, uh, how've you been?

                            AUDREY
               It's good to see you, Nick.

     The Pharmacist puts out Nick's change. He scoops it out
     and we FOLLOW them as they exit together.

                            NICK
               So you made it.

                            AUDREY
               What?

     He points to her fake press ID she's still wearing.

                            NICK
               You're a reporter. That's what you
               always wanted to be, right? I'm happy
               for you. Really, I am.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, well...


108  EXT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                         108

     Nick opens the door for Audrey and follows her out.

                            AUDREY
               So, you still picking apart
               cockroaches?

                            NICK
               No, I'm into earthworms now. You
               wouldn't be interested. They're real
               "boring" creatures. Very reliable,
               dependable, no surprises...

                            AUDREY
               You're still mad at me, aren't you?

                            NICK
               You just left me without a phone call,
               a letter, nothing. All this time.
               Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.

                            AUDREY
               That was eight years ago. Some people
               change, you know.

                            NICK
               Most people don't.

                            AUDREY
               I'm sorry you feel that way.

     Audrey turns and walks away. Nick regrets his behavior
     and calls after her.

                            NICK
               Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight
               years is a long time. Can I offer you
               a cup of tea?

                            AUDREY
               Sure. I'd like that.

     There's an awkward moment as neither knows what to say.

                            AUDREY
               One, thing, though. Who'd you get
               pregnant?

     Off Nick's awkward reaction...

                                             CUT TO:


109  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - NIGHT                           109

     Nick has set up a mini-lab in his private, small, tent.
     The home pregnancy tests have been ripped apart. Nick
     mixes some of the contents together.

                            AUDREY
               I still can't believe it. How does a
               guy go from an anti-nuke activists to
               working for the Nuclear Regulatory
               Commission?

                            NICK
               When you and I use to attend rallies
               in college, we helped to create
               awareness. But from the inside now I
               can actually effect change.
                      (pointedly)
               I never lost my idealism.

                            AUDREY
               And exactly what changes are you
               trying to effect?

                            NICK
               I have this theory that we're
               inadvertently creating new species as
               a direct result of what we've done to
               nature.

                            AUDREY
               And you think this creature is one of
               them?

                            NICK
               Yes. The first of its kind. I found
               this blood sample earlier this
               evening...

                            AUDREY
               Blood sample? How close did you get to
               that thing?

                            NICK
               I got pretty close.

                            AUDREY
               What else do you know about it?

     Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample
     into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of
     the home test boxes and dips it in.

                            NICK
               Well, we know he eats fish, he's of
               reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's
               amphibious and...

     Nick points out the litmus paper. It turns RED.

                            NICK
               ...he's pregnant.

                            AUDREY
               Are you sure?

     Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials.

                            NICK
                      (thrilled)
               Well, obviously these tests weren't
               designed for this but fundamentally
               they're looking for the same hormonal
               patterns that would indicate
               pregnancy.

                            AUDREY
               I don't get it. If it's the first of
               its kind, how can it be pregnant?

     Excitedly Nick begins to pace.

                            NICK
               The ultimate expression of evolution,
               it reproduces asexually. Think about
               it, all kinds of creatures have been
               known to travel great distances for
               reproduction. That's why he came to
               New York. Like every species of
               insufficient progenitors, he's
               nesting!

                            AUDREY
               Nesting?

                            NICK
               Yes. Do you realize that a creature
               like this could lay as many as a dozen
               eggs at a time!

     Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.

                            NICK
               Forgive me but I've got to get this
               into the lab, to confirm all this.
               I'll be right back.

     Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
     poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
     the roof of the case she SEES...


     INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY

     Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love.
     Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
     touched.

     Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
     down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
     FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
     turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
     appears.

                            COOK
                      (filtered through t.v.)
               ...Gojira...Gojira...

     She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
     footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
     the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.

     Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
     out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
     tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.

                            NICK
               Audrey? Audrey?

     A flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's
     confusion.

110  INT. EDITING BAY - LATER - DAWN                            110

     On two monitors we SEE Audrey doing a "stand up."

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               ...which is why in this case "all the
               kings horses and all the kings men"
               may not be able to put the big apple
               together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW.

     We pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor,
     ED, watching the piece.

                            ED
               That's it. You owe me a breakfast.

                            AUDREY
                      (turning to Animal)
               So, what do you think?

                            ANIMAL
               It's good. It's a real good piece. But
               how'd you get a hold of this
               material?

     Audrey covers her own mixed emotions.

                            AUDREY
               Like you said, "Good guys finish
               last."

     She snatches the tape and she takes off running.
     Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave.

111  EXT. WNEW TRUCK - COMMAND TENT AREA - RAIN - DAWN          111

     Rushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey
     spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE
     Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with
     another cameraman.

                            AUDREY
               Murray, I need you to look at this
               tape.

                            MURRAY
               Not now, Audrey, we've about to go
               live with the morning report.

                            AUDREY
               You're going to want to include this.
               I've got exclusive footage of other
               places this thing has attacked.

                            MURRAY
                      (suddenly interested)
               You do? Who's story is this?

                            AUDREY
               Mine!


     ANGLE - CAIMAN

     About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as
     he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field
     producer counts down to going live.


     P.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING

     Through the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on
     towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to
     reveal...


112  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - RAIN - MORNING          112

     One of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the
     window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats
     breakfast with his men. Another man, JEAN-CLAUDE,
     listens at the monitoring equipment. He turns to
     Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               Taisez-Vous.

     He turns on the room speaker.

               ...Major Hicks, what makes you believe
               another attempt to gun that creature
               down will work?


113  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - RAIN - SAME - MORNING       113

     Nick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this
     very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the
     room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of
     Manhattan.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               General Anderson, the problem was the
               terrain. If we lure him out into a
               more open area such as this portion of
               Central Park...
                      (points to the map)
               We should be able to take him down.

                            MAYOR
               Last time you didn't even scratch it!

                            MAJOR HICKS
               That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I
               mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.

     All eyes turn towards Nick who's still arranging his
     papers. Nervously Nick addresses the crowd.

                            NICK
               Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was
               injured and bled.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               You see, all we need to do is get a
               better shot at it with weapons that
               don't rely on heat seeking...

                            NICK
               Um, excuse me, sir, but the
               situation's more complicated than
               that. The blood I recovered revealed
               that the creature is either about to
               lay eggs or already has.

                            GOVERNOR
               Are you trying to tell us there's
               another one of those things out
               there?

                            NICK
               I don't believe so.

                            MAYOR
               Then how can it be pregnant? What is
               this, the "virgin lizard?"

     There's a smattering of laughter in the room.

                            NICK
               No, it reproduces asexually. That's
               why we must find the nest. If we
               don't, dozens will be born, each one
               capable of laying eggs of its own.
               Very quickly we could be looking at an
               enormous population.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               So after we kill the creature we'll
               begin a search for the nest.

                            NICK
               It may be too late by then. These eggs
               will hatch very quickly.

                            CLIVE
               How could you possible know that?

                            NICK
               The fish. The fish we found down in
               the subway. He's not gathering all
               that food for himself. He's preparing
               to feed his young.


114  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - RAIN - SAME - MORNING               114

     Raymond listens intently. He grabs a folder off the desk
     and opens it. We SEE photos and documents of every
     member of the team. He finds the photo of Nick and
     examines it.


115  INT. DINER - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                         115

     Audrey shakes off the rain and moves over to join Ed and
     Animal at a booth.

                            ANIMAL
               They just promo-ed your spot. It's
               coming on right after this.


116  INT. COMMAND TENT - RAIN - SAME - MORNING                  116

     An AIDE comes in and whispers something into the
     Governor's ear, who nods approval.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must
               act quickly before this problem
               escalates.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               You want to divide our efforts based
               solely on a wild theory?

                            MAJOR HICKS
               He's come through for us before and if
               he feels strongly...

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Come through for you!? Major, your
               campaign's a disaster. You weren't
               even able to to prevent this thing
               from coming to Manhattan.

                            GOVERNOR
               Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we
               should see this.

     The Aide moves over to a television and turns it on.
     Just as the t.v. comes to life we SEE the old Japanese
     Cook.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               How the hell did this get out?

     The image of the Cook saying, "Gojira" FREEZES and cuts
     back to reveal Caiman doing his "stand-up."

                      (filtered)
               From an old Japanese sailor's song
               called GODZILLA, a mythological sea
               dragon who attacked sailors, to our
               own modern day terror. Today in my
               special report, who is this Godzilla,
               where did he come from and why is he
               here?


117  EXT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                117

     Audrey is furious, on her feet.

                            AUDREY
               You're special report! I'm the one
               that found that stupid song! That's my
               special report, you bastard!

     Animal tries to calm her down as the story continues.

                            AUDREY
               And it's "Gojira" not Godzilla you
               moron!


118  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MORNING                      118

     Fiddling with the motel t.v., Raymond's men attempt to
     clear the fuzzy picture.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               Merde!

               No, I didn't...I didn't talk with
               anyone.

     The military men are furious at the breach of security.
     All eyes turn toward Nick.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               They mentioned you by name!

               No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh
               my God, she took it.

     Pissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Pack your stuff. You're officially off
               this project as of now.

               We're leaving.

     Nick is finishing packing as some soldiers carry his
     things away. Elsie enters.

                            ELSIE
               I'm sorry about all this.

                            NICK
               Me too.

     Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave.

                            NICK
               Make sure they find that nest before
               it's too late.

                            ELSIE
               I'll try.

     Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the
     rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey
     laying on the floor.

                            ELSIE
               Bye worm guy.

     Something catches Audrey's eye.


     AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK

     Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a
     waiting cab.

               Where to?

                            NICK
               Newark airport.

     Audrey moves up behind Nick.

                            AUDREY
               You're leaving? Why?

     Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab.

                            AUDREY
               Is this cause of me? Because of the
               story?

                            NICK
               Well what the hell did you think was
               going to happen?

                            AUDREY
               You never said it was off the record.

                            NICK
               I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're
               supposed to be my friend. I trusted
               you.

                            AUDREY
               I didn't mean for it to turn out like
               this.
                      (confessing)
               Look, I lied to you. I'm not a
               reporter. When we broke up and I came
               out to New York I was so sure I'd make
               it. But I haven't. That's why I needed
               this story so bad. I just couldn't
               tell you I'm a failure.

                            NICK
               So you thought that made it okay to
               steal my tapes?

     The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He
     stops and turns back to her.

                            NICK
               Good luck in your new career. I think
               you really have what it takes.

     He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving
     a very alone Audrey standing in the rain.

                            AUDREY
                      (sad; to herself)
               I'm sorry.

     Long waiting lines for people trying to leave town.
     People sleeping on the floors. Chaos. One group gathered
     around a television set.


     T.V. NEWS BROADCAST - VIDEO

     We see images from crowed refugee shelters.

               ...every shelter in the tri-state area

               people. Tent cities have begun to
               spring up all over the county...

     As we TRACK away from the t.v. we FIND Nick taking a
     seat at a small bar next to the gate. A WAITER comes
     over.

                            WAITER
               Can I get you something?

     Before Nick can answer...

                            RAYMOND
               Pernot, no ice.

     Taking a seat directly across from Nick, Raymond sits
     down, sizing him up. Nick is confused.

                            NICK
               Do I know you?

                            RAYMOND
               We've met before.

                      (remembering)
               Oh yeah, the insurance guy.

               It's the French Secret Service.

               Oh.

                            RAYMOND
               We have learned that your American

                      (alarmed)
               Are you sure? How do you know?

                            RAYMOND
               We know.

                            NICK
               Why are you telling this to me?

                            RAYMOND
               I need you to trust me.

                            NICK
               Why do you need that?

                            RAYMOND
               I need your trust if you're to help me
               find the nest.

               Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.

                            RAYMOND
               We, have already taken care of them.

     Nick realizes Raymond is serious. The waiter hands
     Raymond his drink. Raymond toasts Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               Bon Chance!

     A makeshift tent city has been set up in the park.
     Animal video tapes an interview with a displaced
     person.

                            DISPLACED PERSON
               No one tells us a Goddamned thing. My
               family is getting soaked out here. We
               have no place else to go. We just want
               to go back to our home.

     Animal begins to PAN his camera around the tent city
     when he SEES a SEDAN in the distance. He focus in on it
     and SEES...

     with.

                            ANIMAL
               I'll be right back.

     Animal rushes over to the news van and takes off after
     them, following.


127  EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - AFTERNOON                 127

     Pulling up in front of a warehouse, Nick and Raymond
     step out of the sedan. Staying hidden from view, Animal
     pulls over. Intrigued, he watches them enter the
     building.


128  INT. WAREHOUSE - RAYMOND'S MEN - AFTERNOON                 128

     Raymond enters with Nick. The room is filled with
     equipment; radios, guns, explosives and armored
     vehicles. We notice that more of Raymond's support team
     are here.

                            NICK
               How did you get all of this stuff into
               the country?

                            RAYMOND
               This is America. There is nothing you
               can not buy.

     Raymond gives Nick a tour.

                            NICK
               So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
               guys working with the US military?

               I am not permitted to speak of such
               things.

     Nick stops and confronts Raymond.

                            NICK
               You said you wanted my trust, then I
               need yours.

     Raymond considers this. Finally...

                            RAYMOND
               I am a patriot. I love my country. Can
               you understand that?

                            NICK
               Sure.

                            RAYMOND
               It is my job to protect my country.
               Sometimes I must even protect it from
               itself. From mistakes we have made.
               Mistakes that we do not want the world
               to know about.

                            NICK
               Your talking about the nuclear testing
               in the Pacific.

                            RAYMOND
               Yes. This testing done by my country
               left a terrible mess. We are here to
               clean it up.


129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129

     Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down
     the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and
     peers into a cracked opened window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE

     Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware.
     Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to
     resemble those of the US Army.

     turns from the radios.

               They will set the trap at thirty
               minutes to ten.

                            RAYMOND
               That is when we will go in.

     Raymond leads Nick over to a large map.

                            RAYMOND
               We know how to get into the city. We
               just do not know where to start
               looking.

     Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the
     Flat Iron square subway station.

                            NICK
               Here. 23rd street subway station.
               Where we first found the fish. With a
               little luck, this will lead us right
               to it.

                            RAYMOND
               So you're in?

                            NICK
               Are you kidding? I always wanted to

     Animal quickly climbs the stairs. People are everywhere.
     He has to step over them to get to his apartment. AS he
     opens the door to his apartment he SEES...


132  INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON               132

     Filled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles
     at Animal as he enters.

                            ANIMAL
               Who the hell are all these people?

                            LUCY
               What? I just couldn't just let them
               sleep in the street.

                            ANIMAL
               Where's Audrey?

                            LUCY
               In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out
               because of you.

                            ANIMAL
               What?

                            LUCY
               All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff
               you filled her head with.

                            ANIMAL
               Me!? You where the one...

                            LUCY
               Go in there. Talk to her.

     Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom.


133  INT. BEDROOM - SAME - LATE AFTERNOON                       133

     Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up
     all around her. A television plays a news broadcast,
     boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the
     t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson
     addressing some reporters.

                            REPORTERS
                      (simultaneously)
               Can you comment on the nest? How many
               more of these things will there be?

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
                      (filtered)
               That's why I'm holding this
               conference. To try and avoid a
               needless panic.

     Animal enters and watches from the back of the room.

                            GENERAL ANDERSON
               Contrary to some frivolous reports, we
               have no information to lead us to
               believe that there are any eggs of the
               creature in the city.

                            AUDREY
               Stupid idiots!

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

                            AUDREY
               It's all my fault. What have I done,
               Animal? What have I become? Look at
               me. This isn't me. I don't do things
               like this.

                            ANIMAL
               You made a mistake.

     Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of
     the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves.

                            AUDREY
               Yeah, I just screwed up with the only
               man who ever really cared about me.

                            ANIMAL
               Didn't you tell me he left for the
               airport?

                            AUDREY
               Yeah. Why are you asking?

                            ANIMAL
               I just saw him. He's with a bunch of
               guys who want to sneak into the city
               tonight.

     Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she
     realizes.

                            AUDREY
               My God. He's going after the nest.

                            ANIMAL
               Perfect! You wanted a story, well,
               baby, you got one.

     Excitedly Animal goes to the closet and retrieves a big
     overcoat.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, I can't.

                            ANIMAL
               Look, you want to make it up to your
               friend? Well if he's right, this is
               your chance.

     He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery
     packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.

                            AUDREY
                      (misgivings)
               I don't know. I've already made such a
               mess of things...

     Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.

                            ANIMAL
                      (smiling)
               Audrey, I'm going after them. You can
               come with me or not.

     Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens
     the bedroom window and begins to climb out.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               Lucy'd kill me if she knew.

                                             CUT TO:


134  INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - SUNSET                            134

     Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a
     military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all
     of Raymond's men dressed similarly.

     As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a
     stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of
     one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the
     wheel.

                            NICK
               What's with the chewing gum?

                            RAYMOND
               Makes us look more American.

     Nick looks over at the faux Americans. It's a tough
     sell, gum or not.

                            NICK
               Just let me do all the talking.

     With that the vehicles pull out of the warehouse and out
     into the rainy night.


135  EXT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - ENTRANCE - RAIN - SUNSET             135

     An armed blockage seals the Jersey entrance to the
     Lincoln tunnel. We widen to reveal Audrey and Animal by
     a small side entrance. Animal works the lock.

                            AUDREY
               What are you doing?

                            ANIMAL
               It's the maintenance entrance. Runs
               along the side of the tunnel. When
               they repaired it last year I worked on
               a piece about it.

     Just then the lock TURNS and the door opens. They
     enter.


136  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - JERSEY SIDE - SUNSET       136

     A line of military vehicles approaches and slowly passes
     through a guarded entrance, each vehicle checked. Nick
     and Raymond's Humvee nears.


     ANGLE - GUARDED BLOCKADE - CONTINUOUS

     Raymond's Humvee rolls up and a GUARD walks up to the
     window.

                            GUARD
                      (checking clipboard)
               Who you boys with?

                            NICK
               Oh, we're with the three two.

                            GUARD
               I didn't ask you, soldier.

                            NICK
               Sergeant O'Neal just called down for
               us to join in.

     Now he's suspicious. The guard approaches Raymond, checks
     him out.

                            GUARD
               You got a problem talkin'?

                            RAYMOND
                      (perfect southern accent)
               Why no sir, I'm fine.

     The Guard is suspicious but on a tight schedule. Finally
     he waves him through.

                            GUARD
               All right, keep it moving.

                            RAYMOND
                      (ala Presley)
               Thank you very much.

     They drive off. Nick is stunned by the act.

                            RAYMOND
               Elvis Presley movies.
                      (by way of explanation)
               He was the King!


137  INT. LINCOLN TUNNEL - MAINTENANCE DOOR - SAME - NIGHT      137

     The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the
     tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the
     tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit
     of the tunnel into Manhattan.


138  INT. RAYMOND'S HUMVEE - NIGHT                              138

     Raymond and Nick drive through Central Park. We can SEE
     dozens of military people and vehicles in a large
     meadow.


139  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LARGE MEADOW - NIGHT                   139

     The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the
     center of the field as many others are planting land
     mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area.

     The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond
     and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right
     past the trap sight and out of the park.


     TIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP

     Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to
     reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and
     heading down the subway entrance.

     Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who
     nearly topples from the weight.

                            RAYMOND
               Be careful with that.

     Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked
     EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's
     gone. Nick regains his breath and follows.


     THE FISH

     Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the
     tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find
     Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're....


140  INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                 140

     The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's
     flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team
     cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish
     are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING
     sound in the tunnel STOPS.

     Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A
     familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air.

                            NICK
               They've turned off the ventilation
               system. They're calling him to
               dinner.

                            RAYMOND
               Let's hope we are not the hors
               d'oeuvres.

     Nervously they continue onward.


141  EXT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             141

     Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's
     vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs.


142  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             142

     Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything,
     climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of
     the platform and searches down into the tunnels.


     VIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS

     Through the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of
     the tunnel.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispering)
               They're down there. Let's go.

     Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of
     the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows.


143  INT. TUNNELS - NICK & TEAM - SAME - NIGHT                  143

     Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old
     SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the
     ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING
     gets louder and louder.

     Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in
     nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds
     the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.

     Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His
     enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and
     into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.

     The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal
     beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them.


144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144

     Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel
     entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a
     panic.

                            AUDREY
               Animal, let's get out of here.

     But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as
     SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at
     him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her
     strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving
     backwards.

     Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS
     outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance
     ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL

     Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up
     just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through
     the ceiling. An amazing site.

                            AUDREY
               Shoot! Shoot it!

     Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it
     disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into
     enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter.


145  INT. TUNNEL - SAME                                         145

     Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main
     tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created,
     examining it. Nick climbs into the hole.

                            NICK
               I guess we go this way.

     Raymond and his men follow.


146  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                146

     Major Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind
     him.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Sergeant, status?


147  INT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           147

     The park is bathed in light. Armed troops surround the
     area. Tanks and missile launchers are in place. Sergeant
     O'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Any sign of it?


148  EXT. ROOFTOP - SPOTTERS - SAME - NIGHT                     148

     From the rooftop of one of the central park south high
     rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area.


     SPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA

     Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his
     way up seventh avenue.

                            SPOTTER
               Got him. Section 5, heading north to
               target.


149  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME                 149

     The Sergeant gives the nod and several teams of shooters
     take off running, taking positions. The tanks turn their
     gun turrets towards downtown, expectantly. Missile
     launchers turn, arming devices locked.


150  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                150

     Major Hicks stands near a computerized schematic of
     Manhattan. A large RED FLASHING BLIP nears Central
     Park.


151  EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - GODZILLA - SAME                      151

     Godzilla moves up 7th Ave. He reaches Central Park South
     and STOPS. He glances over to the park where bright
     lights are glaring.

     Something is making Godzilla more cautious this time.
     Unsure he vacillates between moving forward and staying
     within the shelter of the tall buildings.


     ANGLE - O'NEAL - CENTRAL PARK

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Don't fire until he's cleared the
               buildings and has moved into the
               park.


     ANGLE - GODZILLA

     Still unsure, he ROARS out, frustrated with his own
     indecision.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Come on, come on!


152  INT. TUNNELS - SAME - NIGHT                                152

     Nick leads the team through the cross town tunnel
     created by Godzilla. Climbing over the debris, they make
     their way to another opening. We FOLLOW them as they
     clamber through the hole and into...


153  INT. PENN STATION - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                     153

     The largest subway/rail station in New York. Godzilla
     has torn it to shreds. We get the feeling this is where
     Godzilla has spent most of his time. Scattered fish
     abound.

     High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall
     ceiling. Wherever it leads to is very dark. Nick and
     Raymond stare at the hole together.

                            RAYMOND
               What is up there?


154  EXT. 34TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER - SUBWAY ENTRANCE -       154
     NIGHT

     Climbing the stairs out from the subway, Nick et all
     walk up onto the street to SEE...


     MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

     The team cautiously approaches the building.


155  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           155

     Carefully moving out from between the buildings Godzilla
     takes a step into Central Park.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
                      (into radio)
               Prepare to fire!

     Guns are cocked, locked on and hoisted. Suddenly
     Godzilla gets cold feet and starts to turn around.


156  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                156

     The RED BLIP suddenly begins to move away from the
     park.

                            MAJOR HICKS
                      (into radio)
               Damn it! Fire! Shoot it before it gets
               away!


157  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           157

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Fire at will! Fire at will!

     All the weapons surround the area FIRE AT ONCE. Several
     more Cobra Helicopters ZOOM DOWN out of nowhere.
     Plunging downward, they FIRE at Godzilla.

     The firepower ripping up everything around him, Godzilla
     ROARS and deftly DIVES out of the park and back between
     the buildings.

     But as he bounds over to 57th street, there is a
     contingency of MOBILE ROCKET LAUNCHERS waiting. They
     FIRE. Godzilla DODGES and the rockets DESTROY PLANET
     HOLLYWOOD as Godzilla races by.

     With the helicopters right on his tail, Godzilla makes a
     westward run across 57th street. Smashing parked
     vehicles and his tail SWIPING buildings as it DASHES.


     WEST SIDE HIGHWAY

     Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters
     SHOOTING from the air. Suddenly Godzilla LEAPS higher
     than we've seen before. He hurls himself OVER the West
     Side Highway and SPLASHES DOWN into the Hudson River,
     vanishing beneath the water's surface.


158  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                158

     Furious, Major Hicks throws his headset against the
     console violently. ADMIRAL JOHNSTON leans down into
     frame.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               Don't worry. The Navy has a little
               something there waiting for him.


     THREE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES

     In the murky waters of the Hudson river.


159  INT. NUCLEAR SUBMARINE - THE ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT        159

     The alarm KLAXONS are RINGING OUT as everyone rushes to
     battle stations. The CAPTAIN moves over to a sonar
     screen; a large MASS nearby blips on the screen.

                            CAPTAIN
                      (into radio)
               We've got him on sonar. Arizona
               closing in.


160  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           160

     Different monitors have put up a three dimensional
     schematic of the Hudson river. We SEE outlines of the
     three nuclear subs approaching their target.

161  INT. LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT          161

     The doors are pried open. It's very dark in here, only
     the assault team's flashlights illuminate. As they enter
     the lobby, the team splits up into different search
     groups.

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude move down the large front
     lobby and turn down one of the many hallways surrounding
     the main auditorium.


     ANGLE - HALLWAY - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

     Cautiously they move towards us. In the distance we see
     the rest of the team moving the other direction. Raymond
     and Nick arrive at a door leading to the main
     auditorium. Nick is about to push the door open when
     Raymond stops him.

                            RAYMOND
               Jean-Claude.

     On command, Jean-Claude snaps together his automatic
     rifle as Raymond pulls out his semi-automatic pistol. He
     nods "okay" to Nick who slowly opens the door.

     As the door opens a small pile of FISH tumbles down over
     their feet. They step over the fish and enter.


162  INT. AUDITORIUM - ENTRY LEVEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT         162

     Total darkness. Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude cautiously
     step over the fish inside. Only their flashlight beams
     can be seen.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - TRASHED AUDITORIUM

     His beam cruises over the area nearby. It's been gutted.
     Fish lay strewed on the floor everywhere. Suddenly Nick
     spots a strange cluster of OBJECTS. He moves closer.

     Raymond follows. With their combined light we can
     SEE...


     THREE ENORMOUS EGGS

     A pile of reptile eggs nearly twice as tall as they are.
     Raymond walks behind the egg, illuminating it from the
     other side, making it partially translucent. We can SEE
     THE EMBRYO inside the egg and IT'S MOVING!

                            NICK
               Three eggs. I thought there would be
               more.

                            RAYMOND
               You were right.

     Slowly Nick turns and SEES what Jean-Claude is staring
     at open jawed...


     DOZENS OF EGGS

     Together their beams of light scan across the main
     auditorium floor surrounding the gaping hole to discover
     DOZENS OF EGGS piled in clumps everywhere.

                            NICK
               That can't be. That's got to be over
               twenty eggs.


163  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          163

     Another of Raymond's men (R-MAN #2) has found a
     switchboard, he examines the switches.


164  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           164

     Animal and Audrey are wandering through the debris.

                            AUDREY
               Okay, where'd they go from here?


165  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                          165

     R-MAN #2 locates the switch he's looking for and hits
     it.


166  INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME - NIGHT                             166

     Nick, Raymond and Jean-Claude are stunned as the work
     lights suddenly TURN ON illuminating the room,
     revealing...


     HUNDREDS OF EGGS

     All over the main auditorium floor. A stunning tableau.
     Nick is speechless. Raymond turns to him.

                            RAYMOND
               Start counting.


167  INT. PENN STATION - SAME                                   167

     The light filters down from the gaping hole in the
     ceiling.

                            ANIMAL
               They must have climbed all the way up
               into there.

     Together they notice some large metal piping that has
     fallen from the auditorium. They move over to it and
     begin to climb.


168  EXT. UNDERWATER - HUDSON RIVER - NUCLEAR SUB - NIGHT       168

     The Arizona races past us.


169  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                169

     We follow a runner who hands a report to the Admiral who
     is conferring with the General and Major Hicks by the
     schematic. The Admiral reads the report.

                            ADMIRAL JOHNSTON
               They've surrounded the target just at
               the mouth of the Hudson river.

     Arizona.


171  INT. SUBMARINE - ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                    171

     The lights dim as they prepare for battle.

                            CAPTAIN
               Are we locked on?

                            ENSIGN

                            CAPTAIN
               Fire.


172  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  172

     The torpedo is FIRED and comes darting directly at
     Godzilla who abruptly SWERVES. The torpedo, however,
     FOLLOWS him.


     ANGLE - SUBMARINE - CALVIN COOLIDGE

     From the other direction, closing in. Godzilla DIVES,
     skidding close to the bottom. The TORPEDO begins to
     close the gap.

     Suddenly Godzilla SHOOTS UPWARDS heading directly for
     the underside of the Calvin Coolidge.


173  INT. CALVIN COOLIDGE SUB - BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT           173

     The Calvin's CAPTAIN rushes over to the sonar screens.

                            ENSIGN #2
               He's shifted course. He's heading
               right at us!

                            CALVIN'S CAPTAIN
               Full stern!


174  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME                          174

     Godzilla RAMS the underside of the Calvin Coolidge
     before she can turn. The entire sub SPINS, TWISTING OVER
     its side and colliding directly with...


     THE TORPEDO

     slams into the side of the rolling and dented nuclear
     submarine. With a CONCUSSION the sub EXPLODES.


175  EXT. HUDSON RIVER - SAME                                   175

     An enormous SPRAY OF WATER erupts from the river,
     bubbles and debris float to the surface.


176  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   176

     The computerized representation of the Calvin Coolidge
     VANISHES off the monitor.

                            RADIO OPERATOR
               We've lost the Coolidge, Sir.

     The Admiral burns.


177  INT. ARIZONA SUBMARINE - SONAR CONSOLE - SAME - NIGHT      177

     The BLIP representing Godzilla turns.

                            ENSIGN
               He's shifted course, Sir. He's heading
               back towards Manhattan.

                            CAPTAIN
               Full ahead. Close in and lock on.


178  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  178

               Fire!


180  EXT. UNDERWATER - GODZILLA - SAME - NIGHT                  180

     Boxed in from either side, Godzilla RACES through the
     water. At the same moment both submarines FIRE their
     torpedoes.

     Godzilla reaches the underwater shoreline of Manhattan
     and begins BURROWING FURIOUSLY. As his gigantic claws
     start DIGGING up earth, an enormous TURBULENCE of clouds
     and dirt cloud the waters around him, cloaking him.


181  INT. ARIZONA - SAME - NIGHT                                181

     The Captain and his Ensign are at the Sonar. We TRACK
     two torpedoes approaching target (Godzilla).

                            ENSIGN

               six...


182  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                182

     Huddled around the schematic and radio, they hear...

                            ENSIGN (O.S.)
                      (filtered)

183  EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME                                     183

     The torpedoes ENTER into frame and disappear into this
     undersea dust cloud. An enormous EXPLOSION BLASTS from
     its center, waves of concussion reverberate.


184  EXT. BATTERY PARK - MANHATTAN - SAME - NIGHT               184

     With the EXPLOSION and enormous TIDAL WAVE rises and
     CRASHES DOWN over battery park with tremendous impact.
     Parked cars and phone booths are washed away.


185  INT. ARIZONA SUBMARINE - SAME - NIGHT                      185

     The ENSIGN checks the SONAR.

                            ENSIGN

     The crew erupts in cheers.


186  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           186

     They hear the cheering from the sub over the radio.

                            SOLDIER
               They got 'em!

     The Generals congratulate each other and Major Hicks.


187  EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME - NIGHT                             187

     Toppling down out of the murky turbulence, we SEE
     Godzilla falling away from the shoreline, backwards the
     ocean floor, drifting down to the bottom of the Hudson
     river like so many cement shoed gangsters.


188  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - SAME - NIGHT                  188

     Raymond and his men are laying out the plastic
     explosives around the room by the clumps of eggs.
     Jean-Claude walks up to Raymond.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We do not have enough explosives.

     Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a
     group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him.


     ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME

     Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor,
     Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they
     see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film
     as an amazed Audrey walks through.


     ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK

     Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them.
     Raymond approaches.

                            RAYMOND
               Nick, we have a problem.

     Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to
     listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell.
     Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards.

     The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across
     the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and
     SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in
     close to one getting video footage of it cracking.
     Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however,
     is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it
     approaches from behind.


     ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND

     Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS
     FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous
     WAIL.

                            RAYMOND
               I think we should leave now.

                            NICK
               Good idea.

     The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts
     GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick
     and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough
     distance, they they break into a run and head for the
     exit.


     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL

     The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears
     Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg.

                            ANIMAL
                      (whispered)
               One more second. This is fantastic.

     Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind
     Audrey.

                            AUDREY
               Don't you think we have enough?

                            ANIMAL
               Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

     Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes
     go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA
     appear on the other side of them.

                            ANIMAL
               Just be calm. Don't startle them.

     Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way
     towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the
     floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin
     to SNIFF the air.

     Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM
     breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey
     FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both
     suddenly take off running.


189  INT. MID-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                             189

     Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls
     out his radio.

                            RAYMOND
                      (into radio)
               Everyone, outside! Now!


     ANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM

     Laying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio,
     he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near
     them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off
     running.


190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190

     Two other men are still laying cables for the
     explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH
     near the eggs.

                            R-MAN #2
               Come on, let's go.

                            R-MAN #3
               One moment. I've almost got this.

     Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in
     his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE
     AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly
     retreating R-MAN #3.

     He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
     fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.

     But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and
     LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at
     Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the
     side.

     In moments, they are both devoured.


191  INT. TEAM ENTRANCE - FLOOR-LEVEL - SAME                    191

     Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside.
     The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They
     turn back just as...


     THREE BABYZILLAS

     appear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR.
     Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls
     him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open.


192  INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              192

     Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as
     Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind
     them. There is a sudden THUD against the door.

     Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with
     all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door.

                            AUDREY
               Great. Now what do we do?


193  INT. HALLWAYS - MID-LEVEL - SAME                           193

     Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look
     inside.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM

     Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS
     everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to
     devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away
     and turns and stares directly at us.

     Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both
     retreat back into the hallway. Raymond SMASHES the glass
     covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
     door handles, locking it closed.

     Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
     the locked doorway.

                            RAYMOND
               We've got to lock them inside while we
               can.

     Raymond tosses his cellular phone to Nick.

                            RAYMOND
               Contact the military and get them to
               send a bomber to blow up this building
               before these things escape.

                            NICK
               How do I do that?

                            RAYMOND
               555-7600. Tell them it's a code
               dragonfly. They should get you
               through.

     Amazed by Raymond, Nick just stares at him.

                            RAYMOND
               What are you waiting for?

     Nick snaps out of it and dials.

194  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT               194

     A large and ANGRY mob has gathered at the roadblock to
     the bridge. People, their cars packed with belongings,
     are screaming to be let back into Manhattan. Horns honk
     and the blockade guards are getting nervous.


195  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           195

     The Mayor marches over to Major Hicks who is consulting
     with the Generals.

                            MAYOR
               Do you have any idea what's going on
               out there? The phones are ringing off
               the hook with people screaming to be
               let back into the city.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               We're sending divers into the river
               now to retrieve the body.

                            MAYOR
               That thing's dead. What the hell are
               we waiting for?

     Just then Elise rushes over to the Major.

                            ELSIE
               Major, if Nick is right, this could be
               our last chance to do something about
               it. We have to search for the nest,
               now.

     Major Hicks is torn. Finally he nods in agreement,
     turning to another officer.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Organize a search party. I want a
               complete sweep of the entire city and
               subway system.

                            MAYOR
               You don't have the authority to do
               that.

     The Major turns and cooly approaches the Mayor.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Try and stop me.

     Major Hicks smiles at the Mayor who exits, petulantly.


196  INT. AUDITORIUM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - DOORWAY -        196
     NIGHT

     We SEE dozens and dozens of Babyzillas fighting with
     each other over the last of the fish. Suddenly this
     image is SLAMMED SHUT as doors are closed and a FIRE
     HOSE is rapped around door handles. We widen to
     reveal...

     Raymond fastening the hose around the door. Secured,
     Raymond takes off running.


197  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - HALLWAY - SAME                197

     Nick is on the pay phone frantically dialing as Raymond
     comes up. We hear a BUSY signal from the phone. Nick
     dials again.

                            RAYMOND
               What'd they say?

                            NICK
               I can't get through. I don't know
               what's wrong.

                            OPERATOR
                      (filtered)
               ...all circuits are busy right now...

     Jean-Clude and his partner arrive.

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               We've secured the doors on both
               levels.

                            RAYMOND
               Where's Luc and Pierre?

                            JEAN-CLAUDE
               They didn't make it.

                            RAYMOND
                      (quickly recovering)
               Nick, my men and I will hold them
               here. You will have to go and get
               help!

     Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs. The
     rest of the team SNAP TOGETHER their automatic rifles
     and prepare for a fight.


198  INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME                                    198

     Animal and Audrey are checking out every corner of the
     room.

                            ANIMAL
               There's got to be another way out of
               here.

     Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate
     covering the air vent.

                            AUDREY
               Think we can fit up in there?

                            ANIMAL
               Only one way to find out.

     He rushes over to her and helps her climb up inside.


199  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                           199

     Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the
     doorways. A loud THUMP is heard on the door they are
     guarding. Each turns their weapon towards the doors.
     Suddenly a portion of WALL BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSES.

     A DOZEN BABYZILLAS leaping through the plaster. As they
     spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open
     FIRE. One of the Babyzilla's is HIT.

     His brothers ATTACK. Luc from the other side tries to
     lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd.


200  INT. HALLWAY - MAIN LOBBY LEVEL - SAME                     200

     Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway.
     Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other
     side.

     Just up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he
     can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door
     in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as...


     DOZENS OF BABYZILLAS

     Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick
     slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He
     turns to run the other directions when...


     MORE BABYZILLA

     Come BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned
     down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and
     races over, slamming his hand against the button.

                            NICK
               Come on, come on.

     The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of
     them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards
     him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and
     turn.

                            NICK
               This is not good.

     Just then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside.


201  INT. ELEVATOR - SAME                                       201

     Nick frantically pushes the CLOSE DOOR button but it's
     painfully slow to react.

                            NICK
               I hate these things!

     Just then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to
     move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a
     sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of
     them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator
     begins to rise.


202  INT. AIR VENT - SAME - NIGHT                               202

     Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls
     into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera.
     Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and
     in.

                            ANIMAL
               You okay?

     Out of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again,
     pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another
     vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when
     something catches his eye.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH VENT - RAYMOND

     Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears
     with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to
     shoot.

                            AUDREY
                      (whispered)
               What? What is it?

     Animal doesn't answer, he just shoots.


203  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        203

     The elevator doors open and Raymond SWERVES his gun
     around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands
     in the air.

                            NICK
               Hey, it's me!


204  INT. VENT - SAME                                           204

     Audrey has pushed her way up alongside of Animal to peer
     down through the grating.

                            RAYMOND
               What happened?


205  INT. HALLWAY - SAME                                        205

     Nick keeps dialing the cell phone, still busy.

                            NICK
               They're loose. They're allover the
               main lobby. I couldn't get out.

     Just then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and
     Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his
     weapon trained on their heads.

                            RAYMOND
               Who the hell are you?

                            NICK
               It's okay. I know her.

     Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera
     and FIRES, ripping the camera apart.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey! What gives?

                            RAYMOND
               No cameras.

     Nick moves to Audrey's side, helping her up.

                            NICK
               What are you doing here?

                            AUDREY
               I thought you said there'd only be a
               dozen eggs.

                            NICK
               I was wrong.

     Just then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked
     door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier.

                            RAYMOND
               Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie?
               Anything we can use to contact the
               outside.

                            AUDREY
               What about the phones?

                            NICK
               Circuits are overloaded.

                            AUDREY
                      (gets an idea)
               I know a way. I know how you can get
               a message out of here.

     The door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into
     the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet.

                            AUDREY
               This way.

     She takes off running and they follow. The Babyzillas
     give chase. Animal, hangs back and runs over to the
     destroyed video camera and PULLS OUT THE TAPE. Just as
     he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him. He
     dashes off.


     ANGLE - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR

     Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that
     leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside.

     She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear
     and begin to SNIFF the doorway.


206  INT. HALLWAY - LUXURY BOXES - SAME - NIGHT                 206

     They spill out into the hall and rush past all the
     luxury boxes overlooking the auditorium.

                            AUDREY
               Come on, the broadcast booth is right
               over here.

                            NICK
               How do you know?

                            AUDREY
               Our network covers the Ranger games.


207  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   207

     The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway SNIFFING. One
     of the more aggressive ones starts to CLAW at the door,
     RIPPING into it. Another charges it, THUD.


208  INT. LUXURY BOX HALLWAY - SAME                             208

     They rush up to a door marked BROADCAST BOOTH. Audrey
     tries the door, it's locked. Animal charges his shoulder
     into it, but it doesn't give.

     Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and SHOOTS
     the lock to pieces. He opens the door for everyone to
     enter.


209  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        209

     They rush into the empty broadcast booth. Animal turns
     on the lights as Audrey goes over and boots the computer
     terminal. Raymond moves some equipment against the door,
     securing it closed.

                            AUDREY
               The network is on an intranet. It's a
               direct feed into our computer system.

                            NICK
               Your station won't have any easier
               time contacting the military than I
               did.

     That stumps her. Animal gets an idea.

                            ANIMAL
               When you worked with them, did they
               monitor the news broadcasts?

                            NICK
                      (getting the idea)
               Yes, they did.

                            ANIMAL
               We'll go live! We'll broadcast from
               here. Hopefully they'll see it.


210  INT. MID-LEVEL - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR                   210

     More of the creatures have gathered by the door. Two
     more CHARGE and the door collapses. The Babyzillas rush
     up the stairs.


211  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - EDITING BAY - SAME                  211

     Ed is watching the news feed. Caiman is on.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...Yes, the threat is over but the
               pain continues...

     Suddenly Ed's computer begins to BEEP. Ed slides his
     chair over and looks at his monitor. It reads NEW MAIL:
     URGENT! He double clicks it and a letter pops up that
     reads. Ed pick up transponder CFX 1 and watch the feed.

                            ED
                      (to himself)
               There's no Ranger game on tonight.

     Ed makes a couple of adjustments on his controls and
     turns on a blank monitor. He SEES...


     C.U. MONITOR - AUDREY

     Racing in front of the camera we SEE Audrey in the
     control booth.

                            AUDREY
               ...If you're seeing this, Ed, please
               put us on Live! This is urgent! I know
               this sounds crazy Ed but you have to
               do it. Please, trust me.

                            ED
                      (incredulous)
               I'm not putting you on live!


212  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                212

     Nick turns on a small television and we still SEE Caiman
     doing the news. Audrey turns to Animal.

                            AUDREY
               He's not going to do it.

                            ANIMAL
               Oh yes he will.

     Animal turns the camera and points out the window at the
     BABYZILLA'S below.


213  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - SAME                                213

     Ed's eyes nearly pop out of his head.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Ed, you see that? They'll be all over
               the city if we don't stop them!

     Ed rushes over to the console and goes to work.


214  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   214

     The mode is festive.  The Generals are preparing to leave
     as is Major Hicks. Sergeant O'Neal and some of his men
     are watching the t.v. news.

                            CAIMAN
                      (filtered)
               ...as our fears have been allayed
               thanks to the dedicated work of our
               boys in uniform...

     Everyone in the room begins to cheer. Suddenly Caiman's
     image goes fuzzy. In a moment it's replaced by Audrey.

                            AUDREY
                      (filtered)
               Are we on? Are we live?


215  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                215

     Nick SEES Audrey on the t.v. and gives her the thumbs
     up.

                            AUDREY
               We're live from inside Madison Square
               Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has
               discovered the beasts lair. Doctor,
               tell us what is happening here.

     Animal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays
     back behind the camera, watching.

                            NICK
               We've discovered over two hundred eggs
               which began hatching only moments ago.


216  INT. LUXURY BOXES HALLWAY - SAME                           216

     The creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and
     flood into the hall. Sniffing around they pick up the
     scent and take off.


217  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   217

     A Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his
     attention.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               What is it?

                            SOLDIER
               You better see this.

     The Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the
     t.v.

                            NICK
               If the military are listening, they
               must immediately destroy this building
               before they can escape.

                            AUDREY (O.S.)
               Oh my God! They're coming!

     The camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths
     across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching.


218  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     218

     The bedroom is packed with Lucy's "guests" as they watch
     the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas.

                            LUCY
               Oh my God!

               If those creatures escape and
               multiply, in a very short time a new
               species will emerge. One that could
               replace us as the dominant species of
               this planet.

     Major Hicks is on the phone.

                      (into phone)
               That's correct, I want you to blow up
               Madison Square Garden. No I'm not
               drunk.
                      (to O'Neal)
               Contact the news station. Tell them
               we're on the way.


220  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        220

     Raymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable. Quickly he
     ties it to the support beam.

                            AUDREY
               Reporting live from Madison Square
               Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds,
               WNEW.


221  INT. AUDREY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                   221

     Everyone is breathless watching the news. Lucy beams.

                            LUCY
               That's my girl.


222  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                222

     Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent.

                            NICK
               Thanks, Audrey.

     The computer beeps, Animal reads the message.

                            ANIMAL
               The good news is they got the message.
               The bad news is we've got five and a
               half minutes to get out of the
               building.

     Suddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing
     against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet.

                            RAYMOND
               Okay, party's over. Time to leave.

     With that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window
     SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses
     the spool of cable out the broken window.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone care to join me?

     Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on
     his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond.


223  EXT. AIR BASE - F-18 SQUADRON - SAME - NIGHT               223

     Several F-18's prepare to take flight. We focus on one,
     an enormous bomb attached under its wing. The F-18 taxis
     away from us.


224  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AUDITORIUM - SAME             224

     Repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast
     booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level
     balcony. Raymond signals to the others to follow.


225  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                225

     Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long
     drop down. The door is begging to give way from the
     repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses
     Nick.

                            AUDREY
               In case I can't later.

     With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is
     stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES
     and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps.


226  INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                               226

     Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads
     as they make their way out.

     On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a
     doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The
     Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit.


227  INT. DARK SKIES - F-18 SQUADRON - NIGHT                    227

     The F-18's fly in formation. Their leader carrying the
     same bomb we saw loaded earlier.


228  INT. FLOOR-LEVEL HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT                    228

     Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the
     hallway. He SEES a small group of Babyzillas down the
     hall and gestures for the group to go the other way.

     Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who
     SNIFF the air and decide to pursue. Raymond turns and
     runs.


     ANGLE - FARTHER DOWN HALLWAY - AROUND THE CORNER - SAME

     As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard
     of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the
     concession stands to ribbons looking for food.

     Spotted, the Babyzillas LEAP forward after the team.
     Raymond spots the escalators across the hall.

                            RAYMOND
               The escalators, hurry!


229  EXT. SKIES - F-18'S - NIGHT                                229

     We FOLLOW the squadron as they pass us to reveal the
     beautiful MANHATTAN SKYLINE approaching.


230  INT. ESCALATOR CORRIDOR - MADISON SQUARE - SAME            230

     The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down
     and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The
     escalator comes to life.

     The team runs down the "down" escalators as the
     Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down
     the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others
     are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the
     brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.


231  INT. MAIN LOBBY HALLWAY - SAME                             231

     Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into
     the main lobby and FREEZES. They are surrounded on all
     sides by Babyzillas!

     Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily
     still as everyone freezes.


232  EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - F-18'S - NIGHT                    232

     Closing over the city, the lead bomber breaks formation,
     flying lower, closer to the rooftops.


233  INT. COCKPIT - HUD DISPLAY - NIGHT                         233

     Through the windshield's Heads-Up-Display (HUD) we SEE a
     target LOCKING ON, flashing.

                            PILOT
               I'm locking on now.


234  INT. MAIN LOBBY - MADISON SQUARE - SAME                    234

     As several SNIFF THE AIR, they begin to CLOSE IN. The
     Babyzillas from the escalator corridor finally get to
     the ground level and rush over from behind.

     Raymond spots the large hanging CHANDELIERS in the front
     lobby. He FIRES a short BURST, SLICING the cable
     supporting the chandelier.

     The chandelier DROPS and SHATTERS in the center of the
     main lobby. The Babyzillas scatter, opening a pathway to
     the front door.

                            RAYMOND
               Go! Now!

     Raymond PUSHES the team forward as he takes the rear
     through the pathway which begins to close up as they
     pass through.

     The Babyzillas recover and begin to charge. As Raymond
     passes some CANDY MACHINES, he grabs one and SMASHES IT
     to the ground.


     THOUSANDS OF GUM BALLS

     Scatter all over the floor. As the Babyzillas run, they
     begin to stumble allover each other, tripping on the
     gum balls.

     Animal is the first to reach the main door, he opens it
     and Audrey and Nick are the first to exit. Raymond,
     FIRING MADLY behind as he rushes for the door.


235  INT. COCKPIT - F-18 - NIGHT                                235

     The locked FLASHES RED.

236  EXT. SKIES - F-18 - BOMB - NIGHT                           236

     The immense BOMB drops and takes flight on its own. We
     can see it's heading directly for MADISON SQUARE
     GARDEN.


237  EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT                         237

     Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him. The
     Babyzillas SLAM against the doors. It takes all of
     Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors
     closed.

     Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a
     temporary lock. He pulls Animal away and they take off
     running.


     BOMB'S P.O.V. - MADISON SQUARE - NIGHT

     Rapidly approaching the famous forum.


     ANGLE - RAYMOND, ANIMAL

     Not far behind Nick and Audrey as they race from the
     building. Behind them we SEE...


     BOMB AND BUILDING

     Collide and an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS, engulfing the
     entire building in a mountain of flame.

     Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are THROWN several feet
     forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible
     impact.

     As the building CRUMBLES in FLAMES we HEAR several of
     the Babyzillas SCREAMING. Soon they are silenced.

     Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey. They're both
     shaken up. Nick touches her cheek gently.

                            NICK
               Are you okay?

                            AUDREY
               Somehow I never thought your life was
               this exciting.

                            NICK
               You'd be surprised.

                            AUDREY
               Really? I'd like to find out.

     She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to
     Raymond who has cut above his eye.

                            ANIMAL
               Hey Man, you all right?

                            RAYMOND
               I could use a coffee.

     We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting
     upwards when suddenly...


     THAT FAMOUS WAIL

     Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes,
     a very angry GODZILLA emerges!

     Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and
     nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the
     first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression
     of Godzilla's face; pain.

     But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he
     focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and
     accusingly, at our heroes.

                            NICK
               Ohhhhhhhh.....shit.

                            ANIMAL
               What do we do?

                            RAYMOND
               Running would be a good idea.

     And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our
     team DARTS around a corner just in time.


238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238

     As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla
     BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing
     off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley.


     ANGLE - ALLEY WAY

     Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to
     large brick buildings. They run for their lives as
     Godzilla appears behind them.

     His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he
     BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as
     he marches forward.

     Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just
     they make their way to the other side.

     Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla
     SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path.


239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239

     Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked
     YELLOW CAB.


240  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS - SAME                               240

     In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his
     belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column
     and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's
     amazing.

     As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even
     completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the
     engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out.


241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241

     Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings
     the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner.


242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242

     Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow
     Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner
     behind them Godzilla appears.

     As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a
     single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down
     another street.


243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243

     The cab darts onto 27th street. DEBRIS tumbles down in
     their path as GODZILLA SMASHES through another
     building.


244  INT. CAB - SAME                                            244

     The rear window SHATTERS as falling bricks and debris
     HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side
     street.


245  EXT. LEWELLEN DRIVE - SAME                                 245

     Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out
     onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down
     the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he
     does.


246  INT. CAB - SAME                                            246

     Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power
     up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and
     begins filming out the shattered back window.

                            AUDREY
               Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut
               up Broadway.

                            ANIMAL
               You're crazy, go to the east side and
               take the park avenue to the JFK.

                            AUDREY
               The JFK? In the rain!?


247  EXT. STREET - CAB & GODZILLA - NIGHT                       247

     LEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab
     as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it.


248  INT. CAB - SAME - NIGHT                                    248

                            ANIMAL
               What are you talking about? The east
               side is always faster.

                            AUDREY
               But we can get to the west side
               faster.

     Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down
     trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly,
     darting down a side street.

                            RAYMOND
               Somebody make up your mind!

                            AUDREY & ANIMAL
               Take central park!


249  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - SAME                                     249

     Taking her advice, Raymond swerves up 8th Ave. uptown.
     He GUNS IT and RACES up ahead.


250  EXT. 28TH STREET - SAME                                    250

     The last two turns of the cab have temporarily
     disoriented Godzilla who looks around to find the cab.
     He moves up a block and begins to look around.


     GODZILLA'S P.O.V. - CAB - SAME - NIGHT

     Several blocks ahead, Godzilla spots the cab. He narrows
     his eyes and WAILS ANGRILY. Suddenly he BOLTS after the
     cab.


251  INT. CAB - SAME                                            251

     Animal clears away the broken glass and leans out the
     back window.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW - GODZILLA

     Gaining on them GODZILLA is in hot pursuit.

                            ANIMAL
               Better step on it Frenchie!


252  EXT. MEADOW - SAME                                         252

     The military is cleaning up the trap from before.
     Sergeant O'Neal SPINS as the cab LEAPS out from behind
     the trees.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               What the hell....?

     The cab POWER SLIDES right past and out of the Meadow
     again just as GODZILLA STOMPS directly into the clean up
     crew. Soldiers DIVE for cover as others scramble out of
     the way.

     Godzilla MARCHES after the cab, his tail SWIPING several
     vehicles which tumble, crashing into the troops.

     In a flash, Godzilla disappears back into the forest on
     the other side. O'Neal grabs his radio.

                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
               Command, Command, this Sergeant
               O'Neal. He's back!


253  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           253

     Major Hicks moves over towards the radios.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Captain Rogers, do we still have those
               F-18's in the air?

                            RODGERS
               They're heading back to base now,
               sir.

                            MAJOR HICKS
               Turn 'em around.


254  EXT. BROADWAY - UPTOWN - SAME                              254

     The cab heads up the deserted streets, racing full
     tilt.


255  INT. CAB - SAME                                            255

     Animal pulls himself back into his seat.

                            ANIMAL
               I think we lost him.


256  EXT. BROADWAY - SAME                                       256

     Wrong again! Leaping out several blocks ahead, GODZILLA
     emerges. He KNEELS DOWN and gives a gigantic POWER BLAST
     of his BREATH.

     Cars, street signs, vending machines SAIL BACKWARDS from
     the force.

     A Newspaper vending machine SLAMS into the hood of the
     cab as the cab SQUEALS around a corner, avoiding the
     rest of the onslaught of debris.


257  EXT. SKIES - SAME                                          257

     The F-18's BANK and head back towards Manhattan.


258  EXT. HARLEM - SAME - NIGHT                                 258

     Racing up through the streets of Harlem we SEE the cab.


259  INT. CAB - SAME                                            259

     Everyone is looking around for the creature.

                            RAYMOND
               Anyone see him.

     Suddenly from behind, Animal spots the creature several
     blocks behind. Again, he lifts the camera.


     ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     Running full boar directly at them.


260  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - CONTINUOUS                           260

     Godzilla quickly makes up ground. Running at the cab
     it's only a matter of seconds before he'll reach them.

261  INT. CAB - RAYMOND - SAME                                  261

     Raymond looks up, spots something.


     RAYMOND'S P.O.V. - SIGN

     Up ahead is a sign for the exit for the George
     Washington Bridge. Raymond decides to take it.


262  EXT. HARLEM STREETS - SAME                                 262

     The cab SWERVES heading towards the bridge entrance just
     as Godzilla BITES DOWN, barely missing the cab as it
     turns the corner.

     Godzilla LEAPS OVER THE ENTIRE BLOCK, landing directly
     IN FRONT OF THE CAB.

     The cab SPINS, pulling a full 180 degree turn, and PEELS
     OUT just before Godzilla can SNAP DOWN again, just
     missing the cab.

     The cab PEELS around the creature and UP THE ONRAMP.

     Just then Godzilla LEAPS AFTER THEM. His jaw open, he
     BITES DOWN ON THE CAB.


263  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS                                      263

     Everyone ducks as the enormous JAWS OF THE CREATURE
     CLAMP DOWN OVER THE CAB.


264  EXT. EXIT RAMP - SAME                                      264

     Taking a gigantic BITE out of the highway, some high
     tension wires and the support structure over the bridge,
     Godzilla CHOMPS DOWN on the cab.

     The large cement SIGN SLAMS into the roof of the
     creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab
     with his teeth.


265  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      265

     The sign supports will not hold much longer as it
     crumbles just above the cab. The torn electric cables
     DANGLING dangerous close to the cab.

     Godzilla PUSHES his TONGUE towards the back of the car,
     trying to draw it into his throat!


266  INT. CAB                                                   266

     They're freaking out as the jaws are closing in on
     them.

                            AUDREY
               Gun it! Gun it!

                            RAYMOND
               I'm trying!


     C.U. CAB'S WHEELS

     Spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes
     against it, LIFTING the REAR of the vehicle.


267  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA - SAME                             267

     Like a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying
     to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of
     highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting.


268  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      268

     From the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins
     to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER.

     Nick turns and SEES...


     ELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS

     Sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign,
     Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He
     takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens
     the cab door.

     Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE
     CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick
     leans back inside, slamming the door shut.


269  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA                                    265

     He temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just
     before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again...


     C.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING

     As the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the
     wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD.


270  EXT. GODZILLA - CONTINUOUS                                 270

     As the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab
     SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece
     of highway.

     Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT,
     burning rubber as it enters the George Washington
     Bridge.

     Godzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them.
     Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase.


271  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE                              271

     The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE
     BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge
     WOBBLE.

     The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to
     the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's
     as though they were driving during an earthquake.

     With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more
     unstable.


272  EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE HUDSON - F-18'S - SAME                272

     Swooping down the F-18's head directly towards the
     bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab.


273  INT. COCKPIT                                               273

     The HUD begins to FLASH, LOCKED ON!

                            PILOT #2
               We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox
               2.


274  EXT. BRIDGE - CAB AND GODZILLA                             274

     Only a stride away from being overtaken.


275  INT. OTHER COCKPIT - SAME                                  275

                            PILOT #3
               Stallion 12, Fox 2.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     All at once they FIRE. Missiles heading right at
     camera.


     GODZILLA

     opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them.

     The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST,
     EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His
     WAIL a painful death cry.

     His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The
     impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS
     the Cab into a SPIN.

     SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into
     the road and keeps going.

     The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues
     pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some
     distance.


     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON

     Again they FIRE. A group of missiles darting out.


     GODZILLA

     The missiles HIT, ripping into him. Again GODZILLA
     SCREAMS out, his forward motion stopped.


276  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     276

     Where the blockade and angry mob still wait and watch in
     horror. The Cab SLIDES INTO A SPIN as it comes to a stop
     just in front of the crowd.

     Nick jumps out first, staring back at Godzilla. Audrey
     comes up from behind.


     NICK'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA

     His eyes rolling back into his head as he SCREAMS OUT.
     Slowly he TUMBLES.


     ANGLE - BRIDGE

     Godzilla's enormous head comes CRASHING DOWN in front of
     us. The tremendous impact sends TREMORS across the
     bridge.


277  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                 277

     The gathered crowd is ROCKED from the impact of the
     toppled Godzilla.


     GODZILLA

     His last breath escaping. Defeated and weary, his eyes
     blink slowly as we watch his life slip away.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and
     lifeless face.

     The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them
     begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously. The mob
     breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our
     heroes, surrounding them. Cheering enthusiastically.


278  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     278

     The room is going berserk, everyone slapping hands. Lucy
     turns and gives a "high-five" to everyone around her.


279  EXT. JERSEY SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT              279

     Cameras flash like mad. Several news crews fight their
     way through the crowd.

                            REPORTERS
                      (overlapping)
               How did you discover the nest? Dr.
               Tatopoulis, can you tell us what
               happened back there?

                            NICK
               Sorry, guys, I've promised my story as
               an exclusive to another reporter.

     Nick winks at Audrey. Caiman pushes his way through the
     crowd of reporters over to her.

                            CAIMAN
               We did it! We've got the exclusive!
               Way to go, Audrey!

                            AUDREY
               We? I don't think so.

                            CAIMAN
               I want that story, Audrey. Remember
               you work for me.

                            AUDREY
               Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.

     Audrey waves goodbye as Animal walks over, checking his
     camera and his coat pocket.

                            ANIMAL
               Audrey, did you take the tape out of
               the camera?

                            AUDREY
               No.

                            NICK
               Where's Raymond?

     They look around, but he's gone. Nowhere to be seen.

                            ANIMAL
               I couldn't have just lost it?

     A phone begins to RING. Nick checks his pockets and finds
     Raymond's cellular phone. Nick answers.

                            NICK
               Hello?

                            RAYMOND (O.S.)
               It's Raymond.

                            NICK
               Where are you?


280  EXT. PAY PHONE - DOWN THE BLOCK - SAME - NIGHT             280

     Raymond watches the mob scene from a distance.

                            RAYMOND
               Tell your friends I will send the tape
               after I remove a few items from it.


     NICK AND AUDREY

     Nick nods to Audrey that it's Raymond.

                            NICK
               I understand.

                            RAYMOND
               I just wanted to say, au revoir and
               thank you for your help, my friend.

                            NICK
               Wait.
                      (line goes dead; to
                      himself)
               Au revoir.

                            AUDREY
               Who was that French guy, anyway.

                            NICK
               Oh, just some insurance guy.

     Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther
     and farther. We see the mob, the military, the command
     tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal
     Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.

                                             CUT TO:


281  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           281

     We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though
     we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the
     debris of the station into one of the tunnels.

     We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft
     of light up ahead. We move closer to it.

     As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's
     gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary
     egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. CRACK. IT
     OPENS.

                                             FADE OUT:

          PLANET EARTH.
                         
          Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our
          planet is mythical and majestic.
                         
          The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in
          the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white
          clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep
          blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow
          and brown.
                         
          It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India.
                         
          The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened
          sliver on its Eastern edge.
          It is beautiful! And so full of life.
                         
          But not here.
                         
          Here it is completely silent.
                         
                         SILENCE-
                         
          IN THE DISTANCE-
                         
          A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth.
          If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is
          far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is-
                         
          The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS).
                         
          It resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like
          wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules.
                         
          It floats with a sense of proud achievement.
                         
          It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at
          an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps
          around the Earth per day.
                         
          It is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of
          Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia
          and Ethiopia.
                         
          Soon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes
          smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright
          spec grazing over the blue atmosphere.
                         
          CLOSER TO US-

          Faintly we hear static, voices murmuring over radio frequences.

           Okay, let me tell you a story. It was
           '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every
           time I passed over Texas, I'd look
           down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky,
           was looking up, thinking of me. Six
           weeks I'm blowing kisses to that
           woman. Then we land at Edwards and I
           find out she'd run off with a lawyer
           before I was off the launch pad, so I
           packed my car and I headed to...

           Tijuana. You've told this story,
           Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she
           took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering

           Engineering. Except for a slight
           malfunction on the nulling of the roll

          Stationed around the telescope are TWO ASTRONAUTS carrying out a

          onto the telescope. She is frustrated, determined.
                         
                          MATT
           How are you feeling?
                         
                          RYAN
           Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble
           dried.
                         
          Matt takes out his pistol grip, and with fast precision puts its
          head to a bolt and begins unscrewing. Matt removes the bolt
          with confidence.
                         
                          MATT
           It's been a rough week. If it makes
           you feel any better, I puked up
           everything but my kidneys on my first
           ride.
                         
          Ryan is not as precise with her pistol grip, and when a bolt
                         COMES OFF-
                         
          She DROPS IT.
                         
                          RYAN
           Whoa...! AWOL!
                         
          The bolt spins floating away. She tries to grab it but MISSES,
          barely touching it but brushing it just enough to give it a push
          that makes it change direction....
                         
          She turns and reaches out to grab it, but she is strapped to the
          Robotic Arm.
                         
          The bolt spins out into the emptiness of space when-
                         
                         
          A hand GRABS it before it has gone too far. It is Matt's.
                         
                         
          Ryan looks at him, embarrassed.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab
           things usually fall to the floor.
          Matt puts the bolt away. He begins to unscrew another bolt.
                         
                          MATT
           Hey -- you're the genius up here. I
           just drive this bus.
                         
                          RYAN

                          MISSION CONTROL
           NORAD reports a satellite has incurred
           a missile strike. The impact has
           created a cloud of debris orbiting at
           20,000 miles per hour. Current debris
           orbit does not overlap with your
           trajectory. We'll keep you posted on
           any developments.
                         
          Ryan glances at Matt.
                         
                          RYAN
           Should we be worried?
                         
                          MATT
           Let the boys down there worry for us.
                         
                          RYAN

          The robotic arm moves very slowly, pulling Ryan along while Matt
          begins to unharness from the telescope to shift his position.
                         
                          MATT
           So doc, now that you work for NASA,
           how do you like it?
                         
                          SHARIFF
           Kinda like winning the lottery, isn't
           it?
                         
          She grins at the memory, glances at him. Confesses:
                          RYAN
           I was just happy that they didn't cut
           the funding to my research.
                         
                          MATT
           How long was your training?
                         
                          RYAN
           Six months.
                         
                          SHARIFF
           Including holidays?
                         
                          MATT
           So, what is this scanning system?
                         
                          SHARIFF
           Nothing rad, it's just a new set of
           eyes to scan the universe.
                         
                          RYAN
           Assuming it works, it's just for
           hospital use. This one is a prototype.
                         
                          EXPLORER CAP
           Standby for marking.
                         
                          MATT
           Listen, they don't bankroll
           prototypes, even for your pretty blue
           eyes.
                         
          She gives him a look.
                         
                          RYAN
           My eyes are brown.
                         
          Matt stares at her, a faint smile on his face.
                         
                          MATT
           Right now your eyes are blood shut.
                         
          She grins, looks away -- he got her. Then...
                         
                          SHARIFF
           Kowalsky!
                         
          Matt turns. Shariff raises his arms again.
                         
                          SHARIFF (CONT'D)
           Is this great or what?!
          Shariff JUMPS and FLOATS AWAY from the Shuttle, screaming and
          flapping his arms. A long SAFETY TETHER attached to his waist
                         TENSES AND-
                         
          Brings Shariff to an ABRUPT STOP, snapping him back like a
          bungee cord.
                         
                          MATT
           (for Ryan's benefit)
           And to think he went to Harvard.
                         
          Ryan doesn't react to this, too consumed as she is with the
          panel. Matt looks out. A sad smile is on his face.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           You gotta admit one thing. You can't
           beat the view....
                         
          MATT ENJOYS THE VIEW
                         
          THE EARTH, with its ever-changing surface of blues and whites,
          greens and browns, is massive and serene below him.
                         
                          RYAN
           Mm-hm.
                         
                          MATT
           "Mmm?" So what do you like about being
           up here?
                         
          She hesitates -- trying sincerely to articulate her feelings as
          we GAZE down at the silent planet below.
                         
                          RYAN
           The silence.
                          (BEAT)
           I could get used to it.
                         
          Matt laughs softly.
                         
          We arrive back on him as he turns back to look at Earth.
          Something flickers briefly in Matt's eyes-- something
                         COMPLICATED--
                         
                          MATT
           Hmmmm. Terrific.
                         
          Ryan inspects a panel inside the telescope, studying it with a
          small mirror.
                         
                          RYAN
           Houston, from first inspection comms
           panel appears to be dead. Am I a go
           to cut link to auxiliary?
                          MISSION CONTROL
           You're the expert, doctor. It's your
           call.
                         
          Ryan takes out the small mirror and Matt stretches his arm,
          offering assistance, but-
                         
          She does not want any help and puts the mirror away in her
          toolbox, leaving Matt with his arm outstretched.
                         
          Ryan starts looking for another tool, but Matt is one move ahead
          of her, offering her a pair of tweezers.
                         
          Ryan hesitates and takes the tool. She starts working on the
          panel.
                         
                          MATT
           Houston, I have a bad feeling about
           this mission.
                         
                          MISSION CONTROL
           Please elaborate.
                         
                          MATT
           It's the same feeling I had at Mardi
           Gras in 1987...?
                         
          He waits, letting the moment hang knowingly. Then:
                         
                          MISSION CONTROL
           That is affirmative. Surprisingly,
           control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras
           story. Please proceed.

           Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my
           way down Bourbon Street looking for
           the sister of a friend of mine. The
           streets are swimming with people, I'm
           thinking there's no way I'm finding
           this girl...
                         
          Ryan rolls her eyes and mumbles to herself-
                         
                          RYAN
           Proceeding to over ride.
                         
          Matt continues his story without missing a beat-
                         
                          MATT
           Then all of a sudden I look up and --
           there she is.

           she's holding hands with a short hairy
           guy in board shorts and a

           realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's

           Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done.
                         
          The ROBOTIC ARM slowly withdraws, carrying Ryan back towards the
          Shuttle.
                         
          Matt watches her go, then:

          A PIECE of the debris HITS the Hubble's SOLAR PANELS, making a
          12-inch HOLE in its golden surface.
                         
          A piece of debris passes, nearly hitting them.

          Further back, another piece of debris collides with a bigger
          one. The two chunks of debris explode into a million pieces of
          shrapnel, one of which-
                         
          HITS Shariff's helmet, breaking through the glass and hitting

          Another IMPACT.
                         
          A piece of debris HITS the robotic arm like a cannon ball and
          DETACHES it from the Shuttle.
                         
          The broken piece of the arm SPINS AWAY from the Explorer at a
          great speed with Ryan attached to it. She passes next to-
                         
          THE HUBBLE as a big piece of debris hits the telescope. The top
          of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in
          all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached
          to the arm.

          is...
                         
          ...gone, kicking herself AWAY from the robotic arm and FLYING
          FREE of the rotating arm. She catches a brief glimpse of the arm
          as it helicopters away, then loses sight of it as she rotates
          end over end in endless free fall.
                         
          A PRIMAL SCREAM of God forsaken fear erupts from her lungs.
                         
          The RADIO CRACKLES and Matt's VOICE returns.

           spinning. I can't. I can't.
                         
                          MATT
           Report your position.
                         
          Tumbling end over end, Ryan fixes her gaze on her wrist. The
          effort makes her nauseous. She looks away.
                         
                          RYAN
           GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I
           can't.
                         
                          MATT
           Give me a visual.
                         
          Matt's faint voice is heard on the transmission under a lot of
          static. Ryan is panicking and begins to hyperventilate. Her eyes
          rake the dark sameness of her surroundings.
                         
                          RYAN
           I told you! Nothing. I see nothing!
                         
                          MATT
           Do you have a visual of Explorer?
                         
                          RYAN
                          NO--
                         
                          MATT
           Do you have a visual of ISS?
                         
                          RYAN
                          NO--
                         
          As Matt's signal grows fainter her breathing becomes more
          labored.
                         
                          MATT
           I need you to focus. Give me a
           visual... anything.
                         
          Ryan's eyes flutter, then roll up into her sockets...
                          RYAN
           It's too fast.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          Ryan swallows harshly, her throat suddenly dry.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I can't breathe. I can't...breathe...
                         
          She inhales and exhales with quick short breaths-
                         
          AHHHH... OHHHH
                         
          AHHHH... OHHHH
                         
          Ryan's eyes are wide open and desperate as her breathing
          accelerates.
                         
          AHH... OHH... AHH... OHH
                         
          AHH... OHH... AHH... OHH
                         
          Her limbs look fragile against the black and incalculable void.
                         
          AHH... OHH... AHH... OHH
                         
          She inhales.
                         
          AHH...
                         
          And her throat closes.
                         
          HH...
                         
          Her mouth is open, but she cannot exhale.
                         
          Not a breath.
                         
          Ryan's choking. The lack of oxygen is making her veins pop out
          and her lips turn blue.
                         
          Her eyes open wide, and-
                         
          She exhales.
                         
          OHH...
                         
          And begins breathing deeply.
                         
          AHHHHHH... OHHHHHH....
                         
          As her breathing steadies, she begins to focus, her eyes
          searching the distance.
          THROUGH THE HELMET-
                         
          Ryan can see her face reflected against the visor, lit by the
          control panels.
                         
          She dims the light and she can see-
                         
          Her legs and arms floating against endless space as she drifts
          towards the empty void, broken only by lonesome stars whose
          position change as she rotates, giving way to-
                         
          THE EARTH,
                         
          Very still and very distant. Night is creeping across the sphere
          as the sun sets, a sliver of light on the Western Hemisphere.
                         
          A metallic object floating over the Earth is hit by a RAY of the
          sinking sun, and it gleams like a tiny star. Her eyes blink in
          recognition, gleaming with alertness.
                         
          Her intellect engages and she gains a new sense of calm.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm
           drifting but I have a visual of
           Explorer.
                         
          Her eyes scan the enveloping darkness, trying to get a fix on
          the gleaming orb that is earth, her face alive with
          concentration as she makes calculations.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle
           is at the center of the dial.
                         
          She frowns as she tumbles backward again, recalculating.
                         
          The sun is slipping behind the Earth. She studies the rim of
          fire until it too slides from view.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I can see the Chinese station. No, no,
           no, it's the International Space
           Station.
                         
          The sun's glow illuminates another object in the distance, a
          bright spec hovering over the horizon- the INTERNATIONAL SPACE
          STATION.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock.
                         
          Just then, the sun's rays recede and the Station DIMS, becoming
          one with the darkness. Ryan blinks, mildly alarmed.
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy?
                         
          Silence.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Explorer, do you copy?
                         
          Silence.
                         
          Slowly, the sun recedes further behind the earth and the light
          bathing Ryan's face evaporates. As she is swallowed by the
          darkness, she speaks once again:
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Houston, do you copy?
                         
          THE WHOLE FACE OF THE EARTH IS IN SHADOW.
                         
          And so is Ryan. Her eyes dart. It is utterly silent. She spins
          in the darkness, waiting.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Houston, this is Mission Specialist
           Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm
           drifting.
                         
          There is only the silence, complete and absolute.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Do you copy?
                         
          Nothing. She watches the earth slip from view yet again.
                         
          When next she speaks, the words are as delicate as snowflakes,
          tripping off her tongue like a prayer...
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy.
                         
          A soothing light hits Ryan's face.
                         
          THE MOON is rising over the Pacific Ocean.
                         
          It's almost full and its soft cool light pours over the globe,
          brightening the deep blue waters and-
                         
          IN THE DISTANCE -
                         
          A LIGHT, not bigger than a star, is FLICKERING.
          Ryan's eyes focus on the light. Her PUPILS DILATE. Something
          like tears glistens as she stares at the flickering light,
          afraid to blink as she watches the...
                         
          ...star draw closer, smiling as the faintest thread of a radio
          transmission stitches its way through the silence, listening as
          STATIC SINGS through her helmet, stinging her ears with the
          sound of...
                         
          Her name.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           ... Stone. Do you copy?
                         
                          RYAN
           (almost to herself)
           Lieutenant Kowalsky?...
                         
          The flickering star begins to thicken...
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           Repeat. Do you copy?
                         
                          RYAN
           YES! YES! I copy! I'm here!
                         
          As she watches the figure of an astronaut takes shape.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           Flash your light.
                         
                          RYAN
           My light?
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           So I can see you.
                         
                          RYAN
           Here! Here!
                         
          Ryan opens a pouch in her suit, fishes out a FLASHLIGHT. Hands
          trembling she shines it toward the approaching dot.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           There you are. Hang tight. Report
           your status.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine.
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           Your status! Give me your readings?
                         
                          RYAN
           3.6 psi, I think.
                         
                          MATT
           Your O2. Give me your O2.
                         
                          RYAN
           Steady at eight percent...no seven...
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           You're breathing too fast. You're
           burning oxygen. We don't want to do
           that. We want to relax. Copy.
                         
                          RYAN
           Copy.
                         
                          MATT
           Nearly there.
                         
                          RYAN
           Please hurry.
                         
          Ryan can see Matt quickly growing in size. She continues to
          FLASH HER LIGHT.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh. Sorry.
                         
          She slips the light back into her side pouch just as Matt
          appears as if from nowhere and GRABS HER.
                         
                          MATT
           Gotcha.
                         
                          RYAN
           Arghh!
                         
          Ryan holds on to Matt. Instantly, they begin to spin together.
          Matt takes out a tether.
                         
                          MATT
           Now, I'm going to tether you to me.
          Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him
          in fright. He stares back.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           I know. You never realized how
           devastatingly good-looking I am.
                         
          Matt grins.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           But I need you to stop staring and
           help me with the tether. Okay?
                         
                          RYAN
           Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it.
                         
          He runs the other end of the tether to the harness on Ryan's
          suit and attaches it.
                         
                          MATT
           Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm
           going to give you a little push, just
           so you're clear of the jets--
                         
                          RYAN
                          NO--
                         
                          MATT
           Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.
                         
                          RYAN
           No... No... No... Wait... Don't.
                         
          Matt places his hand on her breastplate and gives her a gentle
          nudge. Drifting again she begins to freak.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!!
                         
          The tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from Matt.
                         
          Matt ignites the thrusters, tugging Ryan behind him. But this
          proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing
          his direction.
                         
                          MATT
           See? Where you go, I go.
                         
          Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does
          so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Better. Let's get out of here.
          Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and,
          igniting a long thrust, he jets away.
                         
          Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and SHE SCREAMS-
                         
                          RYAN
           Ahh Dammit!
                         
                          MATT
           I know what you mean.
                         
                          RYAN
           Ahhh Dammit.
                         
                          MATT
           You're burning oxygen, we're going to
           go back to the shuttle. How's that for
           a plan. Copy?
                         
                          RYAN
                          FUCK
                         
                          MATT
           Right copy that.
                         
          As Matt accelerates toward a lower orbit, his momentum takes
          over, steadying Ryan's swing.
                         
           MATT (CONT"D) (CONT'D)
           Houston in the blind, this is
           Kowalsky. Dr Stone and I are making
           our way to base, please prepare
           Airlock for arrival. Copy?
                         
          They descend, gliding through pieces of debris. Among the space
          junk, a Solar Panel from the Hubble is distinguished.
                         
          Matt eyes a small dot in the distance: the Shuttle.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you
           copy?
                         
                          RYAN
           Why aren't they answering?
                         
                          MATT
           It seems like communications are lost.
                         
                          RYAN
           Can they hear us on an alternate
           frequency?
                          MATT
           We don't know. That's why we keep
           talking. If someone is listening they
           might just save your life. Set your
           watch for ninety minutes.
                         
          Matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets
          up the timer for- 90 MINUTES.
                         
                          RYAN
           Why ninety?
                         
                          MATT
           Houston clocked that debris at fifty
           thousand miles per hour. Factoring in
           our current orbit, I reckon we've got
           90 minutes before we play duck and
           cover again.
                         
          Ryan sets her watch, studies the counter as it begins to count
          down.
                         
                          RYAN
           02 down to six percent.
                         
                         
          As they travel, the Shuttle begins to take form.
                         
                          MATT
           Okay. Pretty scary shit being
           untethered up here, isn't it?
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah. Pretty scary shit.
                         
                          MATT
           (after a beat)
           You did all right.
                         
          Silence.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           (to the Shuttle)
           Houston, in the blind. This is
           Kowalsky. Our current location is
           approximately 900 meters out from the
           Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like
           to retrieve the body of Mission
           Specialist Shariff and return it to
           Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve?
                         
                         
          Silence.
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Roger that.
                         
          Matt changes direction and approaches Shariff. He has to ignite
          several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting
          against Ryan's momentum.
                         
                          RYAN
           Where is he? Where is he?
                         
          Shariff's body is tethered to a PANEL that was ripped away from
          the Explorer. Matt approaches the panel and ignites the
          thrusters to slow down his course, and-
                         
          He grabs onto it. Ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against
          Shariff's body. The contact slows her trajectory, but it throws
          Shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
                         
          Matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. He detaches
          Shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself.
                         
          He lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster,
          pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring
          Ryan and Shariff closer together.
                         
                          MATT
           Grab him!
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm trying. I'm trying.
                         
                          MATT
           Quick. You're pulling me away.
                         
                          RYAN
           I got him. I got him.
                         
          Matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the
          Shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two
          bodies pulls him in all directions.
                         
                          MATT
           Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I
           can't gauge my thrust with you two yo-
           yoing around.
                         
          Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto Shariff's
          body harness. And she sees-
                         
          Shariff's broken helmet. A hole the size of a soft ball pierces
          through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess.
          Ryan's face is inscrutable. Finally she looks away, but this
          time something arrests her gaze:
                         
          A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his
          suit via a small chain. In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon,
          happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG
          ARMS. Transfixed, Ryan is unable to look away, something
          complicated confusing her eyes.
                         
          The photograph floats in the empty space above Planet Earth.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          As they approach, the damage to the Shuttle becomes apparent.
          Explorer has been badly hit.
                         
                          MATT
           (under his breath)
           Jesus...
                         
          The Shuttle has suffered devastating damage. The tail is beyond
          repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other
          waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
                          (GRIMLY)
           Here's hoping you've got one monster
           insurance policy, Houston. Damages to
           Explorer are... it's totaled. Will
           commence search for survivors.
                         
                          RYAN
           02 down to five percent.
                         
          Matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps
          against the windshield of the COCKPIT.
                         
          At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose
          of the Shuttle, losing her grip on Shariff.
                         
          As she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's
          window.
                         
                          MATT
           All right, here we go. Careful of the
           edges.
                         
          Matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows,
          lighting the cockpit.
                         
          Ryan pulls herself up and looks-
                         
          THROUGH THE WINDOW-
          The cabin has been destroyed. A disarray of objects, smashed and
          devastated.
                         
          At the end of the cabin, among the floating objects, a lifeless
          body drifts among the wreckage. Ryan regards it silently,
          mesmerized.
                         
          BANG.
                         
          The face of a second astronaut appears right in front of Ryan
          and crashes against her visor.
                         
          The eyes are frozen, unblinking. Ryan GASPS, wheeling backward
          and away.
                         
          Matt clicks Shariff's harness onto the Shuttle.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Houston, in the blind. To confirm.
           Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and
           myself, Mission Commander Matthew
           Kowalsky, are the sole survivors of
           STS-157.
                         
          Matt turns to Ryan, who is staring at the dead astronauts
          inside.
                         
                          RYAN
           I apologize for not complying. I
           should've stopped working as soon as
           you instructed me to.
                         
                          MATT
           We were going to be hit no matter
           what. There was nothing you could've
           done to change that.
                         
          He begins to reach out, hesitates briefly, then lightly touches
          her shoulder.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Hey.
                         
                          RYAN
           Yes?
                         
          She turns, no elbows this time.
                         
                          MATT
           Alright... We have to get ourselves to
           the Space Station. There.
                         
          Matt gestures vaguely to a bright dot in distance.
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           It's a bit of a hike, but it's our
           only...
                          (CATCHING HIMSELF)
           It's our best option. Agreed?
                         
          She stares at the dot.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Dr. Stone...
           (as she turns)
           Agreed?
                         
          She studies his face and then, finally, nods.
                         
                          RYAN
           Agreed.
                         
                          MATT
           Alright. After you.
                         
          He gently pushes her into space. She slowly drifts away from the
          Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether.
                         
          Matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small
          thrusts, he combats Ryan's swing. And with a LONGER THRUST-
                         
          He shoots forward, pulling Ryan behind him.
                         
          The two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the
          shell of the Shuttle and the remains of the Hubble.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Houston in the blind, this is
           Kowalsky. Dr. Stone and I have
           determined to proceed to ISS and use
           one of their Soyuz for re-entry. ISS
           if copy, please send rescue mission.
           Repeat please dispatch rescue mission.
                         
          They are heading toward a small point in the distance, the Space
          Station, which is in a lower orbit.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 550 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          We see the two astronauts crossing the distance - a thrust, and
          they coast ahead, and then another thrust. Matt pulls Ryan
          behind him.
                         
          Two specks glide across the dark sky as a sliver of light grows
          on the darkened hemisphere.
                         
          THE SUN IS RISING.
          WATCHING THE SUNRISE
                         
          THE SUN looks brighter and clearer than ever outside of Earth's
          atmosphere. The oceans and the continents brighten as its light
          spills over the Earth beneath them.
                         
          Warm rays of sun caress the two astronauts as they propel
          themselves across the empty expanse.

           02 down to two percent.
                         
                          MATT
           We're getting there.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Beautiful, don't you think?
                         
                          RYAN
           What?
                         
                          MATT
           The sunrise. That's what I'm going to
           miss the most.
                         
          But Ryan is not into the view right now. She's stricken with
          fear. Her jaw is clenched and her eyes are almost closed.
                         
          Matt looks at the dark emptiness that engulfs him and smiles.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           So, where's home, Dr. Stone?
                         
          Ryan keeps her eyes closed, doesn't answer. Matt, trying to
                         DISTRACT HER-
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Ryan. Where's home?
                         
          Ryan opens her eyes, but still she doesn't dare to look out of
          the helmet.
                         
                          RYAN
           Home?
                         
                          MATT
           Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where
           do you pitch your tent?
                         
                          RYAN
           Lake Zurich.
                         
                          MATT
           Where the hell is that?
                          RYAN
           Illinois.
                         
                          MATT
           Illinois. Central time zone. That
           makes it roughly... 8pm right now.
           What are the good people of Lake
           Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the
           evening?
                         
          Ryan tries to overcome her fear and looks out. She frowns,
          terrified by the sight, and hides her face once more inside the
          helmet.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't know...
                         
                          MATT
           What would you be doing?
                         
          She tries again. This time she forces herself and stares out at
          the Earth, which is over 500 kilometers below her.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just
           clocked out of the hospital after
           putting in your customary 18-hour
           shift. You're driving home...
                         
          Ryan's wide open eyes are transfixed on Earth, like a deer in
          headlights.
                         
                          RYAN
           The radio. I listen to the radio...
                         
                          MATT
           There we go. Let me guess. NPR?
           Classical. Top for--
                         
                          RYAN
           Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as
           they don't talk. I just drive...
                         
          Her glassy eyes reveal a strong emotion growing inside of her,
          taking over her body. It is not fear, it is something deeper and
          more painful.
                         
          Matt studies her curiously.
                         
                          MATT
           What do you miss down there?
                         
          Ryan looks at the Earth. It never felt so far away.
          A long silence without an answer.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Is there a Mr. Stone?
                         
          She frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a
          particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head.
                         
                          RYAN
           No...
                         
                          MATT
           Nobody special? Someone down there,
           looking up, thinking of you?
                         
          Ryan closes her eyes. She remains silent. A silence that can't
          hide an unspeakable pain.
                         
                          RYAN
           I had a daughter.
                         
          Her eyes flutter, then open. She is frozen in this moment, as if
          stunned.
                         
          Her gaze shifts and finds-
                         
          Matt, studying her in his MIRROR.
                         
                          MATT
           What was her name?
                         
                          RYAN
           Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing-
           a school trip to the swimming pool.
           She was playing tag- she slipped, hit
           her head, and that was it... She loved
           tag. I'm sure she was laughing.
                         
          She looks away, toward Earth. It looks small. Remote.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           When I received the call I was driving
           and ever since that's what I do. I
           wake up, I go to work and then I just
           drive.
                         
          Matt finally averts his eyes. He rolls his wrist over, consults
          the timer, watching the numbers slowly count down.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           02 down to one percent.
                          MATT
           Well, well, what d'you know. I have
           good news and bad news.
                         
                          RYAN
           Uhuh?
                         
                          MATT
           The good news is we're five minutes
           from the ISS and I know where
           the Russians stash their vodka... and
           that's a good thing cus I'm running
           out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be
           ten minutes short of......breaking
           Anatoly's record.
                         
                         
          SUDDENLY, COMING FROM INSIDE RYAN'S HELMET-
                         
          BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
                         
                          RYAN
           Mmm...Mmmm.
                         
                          MATT
           What?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure
           is low...
                         
                          MATT
           The tank may be empty but there's
           still oxygen in your suit, so sip,
           Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer.
           Sip. We'll get you there.
                         
          She nods.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Let's go.
                         
          Matt gives Ryan a gentle push, waiting until the tether goes
          taut, and-
                         
          He gives a SMALL THRUST to position himself in the right
          direction.
                         
          He holds this SINGLE THRUST for longer than all of the previous
          ones, immediately gaining speed, descending towards-
                         
          THE SPACE STATION-
          Which is half a mile away, and now all of its modules are
          clearly visible. It also becomes clear that-
                         
          IT WAS HIT BY THE DEBRIS.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Houston in the blind we have visual of
           the ISS. Station must have been
           evacuated because first Soyuz is
           missing. Second Soyuz exhibits surface
           damage and chute has deployed. It's
           use as escape pod for re-entry to
           Earth is impossible.
                         
          The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels
          have been ripped.
                         
          THE SECOND SOYUZ becomes visible, attached to the Station's
          Docking Module. A piece of red and white fabric floats around
          the spherical capsule.
                         
          Ryan's losing her breath.
                         
                          RYAN
           Shouldn't we be turning? We're
                          DRIFTING AGAIN--
                         
                          MATT
           Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We
           want to drift. I wasn't kidding about
           those fumes. This can has one or two
           good thrusts left. If we're lucky....
                         
          They approach the Space Station, which is just ahead of them and
          a hundred meters below.
                         
          She's sweating and starts to hyperventilate.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Steady...
                         
          She looks down, eyes the Station passing beneath them.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Ready... aim...
                         
          It looks as though the Station is going to slip away altogether.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           ...fire.
                         
          Matt triggers his THRUSTER, turning sharply. Ryan's trajectory
          carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses,
          breaking Matt's direction.
          He fires again to counter her momentum.
                         
          A VERY LONG THRUST sends both of them in the right direction,
          straight down toward the Station, but at great speed.
                         
          The Station is getting very close, and they're going very fast.
                         
          Matt ignites the FRONTAL THRUSTER, which begins to slow him
          down, but the thrust stops.
                         
          Ryan, following her own momentum, begins to pass Matt.
                         
                          RYAN
           Break... You have to break.
                         
                          MATT
           I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in
           fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab
           onto anything you can and hold tight!
                         
          Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to
          grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms.
                         
          Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station.
          As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing.
                         
          Ryan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt.
          The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing.
                         
          Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab
          hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but
          she's floating too high.
                         
          She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one
          handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the
          black void.
                         
          She extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear life
                         AND-
                         
          SHE STOPS.
                         
          She's holding onto the handle.
                         
                          RYAN
           I got it. I got it.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          She looks up and sees-
                         
          Matt is floating straight toward her and-
          He COLLIDES against her. For a moment they are face to face,
          only the glass of their headgear separates their faces.
                         
          But she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her
          into the emptiness.
                         
          Her drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel. She crashes
          against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it.
                         
          Ryan bounces down towards the Earth, tensing the tether, pulling
          Matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel.
                         
          The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm
           I'm detached.
                         
                          MATT
           Grab a hold. Grab anything.
                         
          Ryan is drifting away from the Station. She sees the infinite
          black void ahead of her and-
                         
          HER FOOT GETS STUCK IN THE PARACHUTE.
                         
          It becomes tangled in the strings and fabric, slowing her down.
                         
          Ryan is panting, her face covered in sweat. She turns back and
                         SEES-
                         
          Matt rolling, drifting in her direction.
                         
          She stretches out her arm.
                         
          Matt's arm is also outstretched.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
                          (AN EDGE)
           Give me... give me five here, Ryan.
                         
          He's trying to make light of it, but he's really struggling to
          reach her.
                         
          Ryan stretches farther.
                         
          Matt's hand comes closer to hers.
                         
          The tips of their fingers are almost touching.
                         
                          RYAN
           I've got you. I've got you--
                         
          The very tips of their fingers touch --
          BUT THEY MISS.
                         
          As Matt drifts past.
                         
                          MATT
           Shit... shit...
                         
                          RYAN
           No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you.
           Don't. Don't. NO
                         
          As the parachute tenses, she STOPS.
                         
          The tether attached to Matt's suit passes two feet away from her
                         AND-
                         
          Ryan grabs the tether. It slides through her closed fist, until-
                         
          Her grip tightens and the tether STOPS.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Gotcha!
                         
          Matt's momentum is now pulling Ryan, dragging her loose from the
          parachute.
                         
                          MATT
           You have to let me go.
                         
                          RYAN
           What? No--
                         
                          MATT
           You have to.
                         
                          RYAN
           No!
                         
                          MATT
           Those ropes are too loose,
           I'm pulling you with me. You have to
           let me go or we both die--
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm not letting you go! We're fine.
                         
          Her leg slides through the loose rope and she floats further
          out, being snagged at the last minute by a tether around her
          foot. (We move from high-angle to low angle two shot). As this
                         HAPPENS:
                         
                          MATT
           Ryan!
                          RYAN
           You're not going anywhere, you're not
                          GOING ANYWHERE--
                         
                          MATT
           It's not up to you.
                         
          Matt begins to unharness the tether.
                         
                          RYAN
           Please don't do this.
                         
          Matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Please don't do this. Please don't do
           this.
                         
                          MATT
           You're going to make it Ryan.
                         
           RYAN (O.S.)
           No!
                         
          He opens his hand, letting go of the tether, and BEGINS TO FLOAT
          AWAY.
                         
          Relieved of Matt's pull, the parachute begins to retrieve,
          pulling Ryan closer to the Station.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I had you! I had you.
                         
          Matt drifts away from the Station into the empty space.
                         
          Ryan bumps against the station, pulled by the parachute, and she
          twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           Ryan do you copy? Do you copy?
                         
          An ALARM GOES OFF.
                         
                          RYAN
           My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm
           went off.
                         
                          MATT
           You need to board the station. Can you
           see the airlock?
                         
          She turns, looking for the Station's Airlock.
                          MAT
           Do you copy?
                         
           (P.O.V shot - beginning to blur)
                         
                          RYAN
           Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           Good. That's where you want to go.
           You're losing focus, right?
                         
                          RYAN
           Yes.
                         
                          MATT
           That's because you're breathing CO2
           and you're losing consciousness. You
           need to board the Station.
                         
          Her eyes flutter...
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
                          (ON RADIO)
           Move!
                         
          Ryan blinks, TURNS OFF the ALARM, and begins climbing over a
          module of the Station.
                         
                          RYAN
           Ok.
                         
          The transmission becomes weaker, filled with STATIC.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           Now listen to me. That second Soyuz is
           too damaged for re-entry,
           but it's perfectly fine for a little
           Sunday drive.
                         
                          RYAN
           Sunday drive...?
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           Look to the west... You see that dot
           in the distance? That is the Chinese
           Station. You're going to take the
           Soyuz and cruise over there. The
           Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou.
                          RYAN
           I've never flown a Shenzhou--
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           That doesn't matter. Its re-entry
           protocol is identical to the Soyuz's--
                         
                         
                         
          She nods, already looking.
                         
                          RYAN
           Ok.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           You've never flown a Soyuz either.
                         
                          RYAN
           Only on a simulator.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           So then you know.
                         
                          RYAN
           I crashed it. I--
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           It's a Simulator. That's what it's
           designed for.
                         
                          RYAN
           Every time. I crashed the Simulator
           every time.
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           It's not rocket science. Just point
           the damn thing at earth and
           by this time tomorrow you'll be back
           in Lake Zurich with one hell of a
           story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You
           copy?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm going to take the Soyuz and come
           get you.
                         
                          MATT
           No you're not. . I have too much of a
           head start. That ship already sailed.
                          RYAN
           No. I'm coming to get you.
                         
                          MATT
           Ryan, you're going to have to learn to
           let go.
                         
                          RYAN
           But... I...
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           I want to hear you say you're going to
           make it.
                         
          Ryan is struggling for breath.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
                          (ON RADIO)
           Ryan! Say it!
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm... I'm going to make it.
                         
                          MATT
           Alright. Keep going
                         
          Ryan stares at Matt's tiny figure in the distance.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?
                         
                          RYAN
           Dad wanted a boy.
                         
                          MATT
           Are you close to the airlock?
                         
                          RYAN
           Not yet.
                         
                          MATT
           Keep going.
                         
          Ryan continues to the Airlock.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           So, now that we have some distance
           between us- you're attracted to me,
           aren't you?
                         
                          RYAN
           What?
                          MATT
           Well, people say I have beautiful blue
           eyes.
                         
                          RYAN
           You... you have beautiful... you have
           beautiful blue eyes.
                         
                          MATT
           I have brown eyes... that hurts.
                         
          She looks at Matt's figure receding.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
                          (ON RADIO)
           You wanna know the good news?
                         
                          RYAN
           What?
                         
                          MATT
                          (ON RADIO)
           I'm going to break Anatoly's record,
           and I think mine's going to stand for
           a long, long time.
                         
                          RYAN
           No... I'm coming to get you.
                         
                          MATT
           You know, Ryan is a nice name for a
           girl. Wow, you should see the sun on
           the Ganges. It's amazing.
                         
                         
                         
          Ryan starts to respond, then falters, watching Matt's figure
          grow ever smaller.
                         
          THE SAD CROONING of HANK WILLIAMS crackles through the dying
          radio.
                         
                          RYAN
           (in a daze)
           Matt...
                         
          Only static hisses...
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Matt!
                         
          Static again as Matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming
          lost in a sea of white specks and-
          The transmission ends.
                         
                         
                         
                         SILENCE
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          Ryan is dizzy, sweating, and having trouble focusing. She sees
                         MATT-
                         
          Nothing more than a dot.
                         
          She stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him
          with the tips of her fingers. But the dot has already vanished
          into never-ending darkness.
                         
          EVERYTHING IS BLURRED.
                         
          Ryan is about to lose consciousness, when-
                         
          A new ALARM GOES OFF.
                         
          She takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely.
                         
          If she doesn't move, she'll die.
                         
          Ryan pulls herself forward, reaching for a handle on the Soyuz.
          She grabs it and reaches for another, climbing her way toward
          the Station's airlock.
                         
          But she's losing focus.
                         
          As her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a
          blur, and she misses.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET -
                         
          Her brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen. She struggles to
          open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible.
                         
          She reaches up again, almost blindly. Her hand grips the handle,
          and with one huge effort-
                         
          She sprints across the Docking Module, swinging from handle to
          handle, in one continual push, until she reaches the-
                         
          AIRLOCK.
                         
          She stops, takes one deep breath and-
                         
          She turns the latch and OPENS the re-entry hatch.
          The hatch BLOWS OPEN as the air inside the cabin escapes into
          the vacuum, almost throwing Ryan back into space, but she holds
          tightly onto the latch.
                         
          She hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen
          inside her life system. She sees her feet dangling against the
          emptiness of space and-
                         
          With one last effort, she pulls herself into the airlock.
                         
                         
          AIRLOCK MODULE. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 500 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          As she enters she does a 180-degree flip. As soon as her legs
          are in, she grabs onto the latch, and-
                         
          CLOSES THE HATCH.
                         
          She turns the latch and-
                         
          THE CABIN IS SEALED OFF.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          Ryan is suffocating. With very little oxygen and her body
          intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood, her breathing is
          coarse and painful.
                         
          She can hardly keep her eyes open, and she pushes herself
          through the cabin, an empty cylinder lit by two circular mercury
          lights. She reaches the-
                         
          CONTROL PANEL, a small computer with a screen that monitors the
          atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock.
                         
          She presses a button on the panel and-
                         
          THE CABIN BEGINS TO PRESSURIZE.
                         
          A low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the Station
          begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock. The control panel's
          monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          Ryan gasps for air, but there is none.
                         
          She stares at the red-orange-green graph on the control panel
          showing the atmospheric levels. It reads red. Her pupils begin
          to dilate as-
                         
          SOUND BEGINS TO SURFACE-
          In the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves,
          but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly
          fills the cabin.
                         
          The sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world
          heard from within the womb.
                         
          A beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious
          and halting.
                         
          The Control System's graph slowly moves from red to orange. The
          cabin is still not fully pressurized.
                         
          But that will have to do.
                         
          With one sharp motion-
                         
          SHE TAKES OFF HER HELMET-
                         
          And pushes it from her head.
                         
          She gasps for air and coughs.
                         
          She contorts and shakes, fighting to breath in the thin
          atmosphere of the airlock. Her helmet bounces around the walls
          of the cabin, floating.
                         
          The beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable - it is an
          alarm ringing out across the Station.
                         
          Orange is turning to green. Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen
          and her breath becomes more even. Her body floats, relaxed in
          the confined space of the airlock.
                         
          SHE FLOATS.
                         
          Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove.
                         
          And then the other.
                         
          Desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. She
          squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half.
                         
          Then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if
          shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the
          claustrophobia of the suit.
                         
          Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air,
          relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds
          her.
                         
          Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them
          in her arms, floating in a fetal position.
          For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber,
          surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in
          the cabin's womb.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          The International Space Station, with its modules, its torn
          solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out
          from its center, is dwarfed against Earth's orb and the infinite
          universe stretching out beyond.
                         
          The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the
          grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below.
                         
          Everything is still.
                         
                         
          INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. ZVEZDA MODULE.
                         
          The module is like a wide corridor filled with cabinets, a small
          eating area and a small gym. A HUM reverberates across the
          station.
                         
          At the end of the module there is an open circular hatch leading
                         INTO THE-
                         
                         
          UNITY NODE 1.
                         
          A spherical space with three hatches, each leading into
          different modules.
                         
          A HATCH OPENS and-
                         
          Ryan floats in. She stops at the center and holds onto a handle.
                         
          She looks in all directions and launches to her right, towards
                         THE-
                         
                         
          ZARYA MODULE.
                         
          There are sleeping bags fastened to the walls. Clothes, shoes, a
          strip of three condoms -- all kinds of personal objects float in
          chaos around the module.
                         
          It's clear that someone left in a hurry.
                         
          Ryan passes a stationary bicycle and reaches for a metal cabinet
          on the wall.
          She OPENS drawers, looking for something.
                         
                          RYAN
           Come on, come on.
                         
          She finds what she's looking for: a BAG OF WATER with a straw at
          one end. She unscrews the top and begins to drink from it.
                         
          She DRINKS in long gulps, squeezing the bottle, trying to quench
          her thirst. DROPS FLOAT out of her mouth as the water overflows.
          They float around her face like perfect pearls of different
          sizes.
                         
          She takes a pause from drinking to catch her breath. The water
          is cooling her down, but she still takes another long, thirsty
          gulp and empties the bag.
                         
          She checks the count on the STOPWATCH- 14 minutes and counting
          down.
                         
          She takes a new bag of water from the drawer, and pushing
          herself off of a wall, she dives into the-
                         
          UNITY NODE 2-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           OK. Where are you? Where are you?
           Comms. Comms... There you are!
                         
          Without stopping, she goes through one of the open hatches into
                         THE-
                         
                         
          ZVEZDA MODULE.
                         
          The walls are filled with electrical equipment and wires.
          Without slowing down her momentum, she floats to the-
                         
          MAIN CONSOLE- A large deck which houses all of the communication
          and navigational systems.
                         
          On the opposite wall there is a LARGE PORTHOLE through which
          Earth is clearly seen.
                         
          She begins to PUSH BUTTONS.
                         
          COMPUTERS COME TO LIFE and Ryan puts on a communications
          headset.
                         
          STATIC CRACKLES.
                         
                          RYAN
           Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?
          She waits.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?
                         
          Nothing... only static.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside
           the Station... Do you copy?
                         
          She drifts along the module, listening intently through the
          headset.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Come on Matt. Talk to me.
                          (NOTHING)
           Tell me where you are.
                          (NOTHING)
           Give me your position...
                         
          No voices. Just static.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Where are you? Give me a visual...
           tell me what you see.
                         
          Nothing.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Oh, come on. You've been yammering
           nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral,
           and now you decide to shut up?
                         
          She waits ONE SECOND, TWO SECONDS-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Come on Matt, talk to me!
                         
          The signal cuts in and out, but remains indecipherable. There is
          something unnerving about it.
                         
          She drops her head and continues drifting toward the porthole,
          listening as the STATIC SPUTTERS.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Say something... Anything.
                         
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me
           about the hairy guy. What happened?
          Waiting for him to respond, and in a softer voice, completely
                         RESIGNED-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this.
                         
          She bumps against the PORTHOLE, and glances out-
                         
          The Earth glimmers brightly. A third of the hemisphere is in
          complete darkness. Her FACE REFLECTED in the glass is
          SUPERIMPOSED over the EARTH.
                         
          Her eyes glisten briefly, but she fights it back. Then she pulls
          herself together, and begins reporting-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Houston in the blind.
                         
                         
          The way Matt would have done it-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
           reporting from the ISS... All
           communication with Mission Commander
           Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio
           transmission is absent. Visual is
           nonexistent.
                          (A BEAT)
           To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole
           survivor of STS-157.
                         
          Ryan hovers by the porthole, looking hopeless.
                         
          All is silent save for the RADIO static and the hum of the Space
          Station.
                         
          Outside the Aurora Borealis performs its ghostly dance over the
          Earth's Northern Hemisphere.
                         
          SILENCE. Only the hum and the static, when-
                         
          An ALARM CHIRPS, RED LIGHTS FLICKERING across the module.
                         
          Ryan twists, swimming back to the control panel, studying a
          FLASHING grid of LEDS:
                         
          GRAPH OF THE STATION-
                         
          ...where a blinking light indicates the Japanese Module IS ON
          FIRE.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           What now?
                         AND THEN-
                         
          The Destiny Lab begins blinking.
                         
          THE FIRE IS EXPANDING
                         
          She pushes herself toward the hatch, swimming through the few
          pieces of paper still hovering as she exits into the-
                         
                         
          UNITY NODE 1.
                         
          The ALARM'S STACCATO is blasting in synchrony with the emergency
          lights blinking across the station.
                         
          SMOOTH BLUE FLAMES ribbon eerily across the skin of the Destiny
          Lab. They are spreading, expanding with a dense cloud of SMOKE.
                         
          Ryan enters and snatches a FIRE EXTINGUISHER on the wall of the
          module, and-
                         
          She points the nozzle at the fire and SPRAYS.
                         
          With no gravity to hold her down, the force of the spray SENDS
          HER FLYING BACK and-
                         
          SHE CRASHES AGAINST A WALL. The fire extinguisher bangs against
          her face and CUTS HER LIP.
                         
          The impact is so strong that it almost knocks her out. Her eyes
          fill with tears but she reacts.
                         
          There's no time to lose. She fastens her feet to a strap on the
          floor, and-
                         
          SPRAYS the extinguisher at the fire. But the extinguisher is no
          match for the fire, which has gathered in a gigantic smooth blue
          ball and is expanding, coming at her.
                         
          Ryan makes a fast turn and launches herself in the opposite
          direction into the-
                         
                         UNITY NODE-
                         
          Dashing straight into the-
                         
                         ZARYA MODULE-
                         
          She darts across the module, behind her-
                         
          The expanding fire ball has swallowed the Unity Node and is
          making its way towards her, chasing her into the-
                         
          UNITY NODE 2-
          Where she makes a quick turn and darts down into the-
                         
                         
                         DOCKING MODULE-
                         
          Just in time. Above her, the flames cross the Node as they
          spread into the rest of the Station.
                         
          They quickly spread downward, into the Docking Module.
                         
          Ryan, the flames caressing her feet, dives through a hatch into
                         THE-
                         
                         
          SOYUZ. AIRLOCK.
                         
          Ryan crashes against a Space Suit floating inside and turns to
          close the hatch.
                         
          THE FIRE is spreading outside in the module, sucking the oxygen
          out of the Soyuz. An incandescent blue bubble that charges at
          her.
                         
          Ryan, faster than fire, CLOSES THE HATCH.
                         
          THE SOYUZ IS SEALED OFF.
                         
          She closes a second hatch, and the Soyuz is safe.
                         
          She exhales in RELIEF.
                         
          A RUMBLE in the Station makes the Soyuz quake.
                         
          The extinguisher is blocking her path to the hatch and Ryan has
          to push it into the cabin as she darts toward the-
                         
                         
          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          As soon as she makes it through the hatch, she TURNS the CABIN
          LIGHTS ON.
                         
          There is just enough space for three astronauts to sit
          surrounded by the CONTROL PANEL that navigates the vessel.
                         
          She sits down in the command chair.
                         
          She fastens the safety belt, and looks around, trying to
          recognize the different buttons on the panel, which are all
          labeled in Russian.
                         
                          RYAN
           OK... where was it?... where was it?
          She moves her finger across the different buttons, searching.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Where is the power?... Here you are.
                         
          Her finger stops on a button, which is labeled- BKN
                         
          She presses on it and the CONTROL PANEL turns ON. All the
          buttons light up and with a hum, the Soyuz's systems start to
          run.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Good... good... just like training...
                         
          Ryan reaches to the right, where next to the panel, there are
          several binders, each a different color.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Undocking... undocking... Yes...
           red...
                         
          And she takes out a RED BINDER.
                         
          It's all written in Cyrillic. She turns the pages until she sees
          a GRAPHIC representing the UNDOCKING PROCEDURE.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ok... Ok... I remember this...
           undocking...
                         
          She uses the CURSORS on the panel and selects a function on the
          COMPUTER SCREEN.
                         
          She presses another button and-
                         
          On the SCREEN, a COUNTDOWN- 4:30... 4:29... 4:28...
                         
          Another RUMBLE in the Station.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           We don't have four minutes to spare.
           We're going manual...
                         
          She flips through the binder to another page. She looks at a
          diagram and uses the cursors on the panel to change the function
          on the screen-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay. Arming the system...
                         
          She releases the SAFETY LOCK on a BUTTON.
                         
          AN EXPLOSION in the Station makes everything shake. The
          vibration passes through her body, startling her, and-
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Firing the pyros...
                         
          SHE PRESSES the BUTTON.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Rezerv rasstyk!
                         
          The SOUND of a mechanism releasing reverberates throughout the
          vessel.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 500 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          SILENCE.
                         
          A SPRING MECHANISM pushes the Soyuz away from the Station.
                         
          SLOWLY.
                         
          VERY SLOWLY.
                         
          The Spacecraft is made out of three modules- the ENGINE, the
          CONTROL CABIN, and the AIRLOCK at the front.
                         
                         
          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          Detached from the Space Station, the rumbling has ceased,
          leaving only the gentle hum of the cabin.
                         
          ON THE PERISCOPE-
                         
          The distance between the Soyuz and the Docking Module grows
          little by little as the vessel drifts away from it.
                         
          Ryan sits tensely and checks the manual and-
                         
          She presses different buttons, bringing to life a new set of
          systems.
                         
                          RYAN
           I engaged manual control- R O A K and
           RYD are activated.
                         
          She grabs the joysticks with her hand, and-
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The lateral thrusters give a small thrust, and as the spacecraft
          moves away from the Station it drags its parachute, which floats
          lifelessly in space.
          ANOTHER BIGGER THRUST, and as the Soyuz pulls away from the
          Station, the parachute's ropes tense, and-
                         
          A BIG JOLT.
                         
                         
          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          Her seat belts prevent her from being projected forward as the
          Soyuz is pulled to a sudden stop.
                         
          Ryan is very confused, unaware of the reason for the sudden
          stop. She looks at-
                         
                         THE PERISCOPE-
                         
          The Station is drifting out of the scope's sight.
                         
          She turns to-
                         
                         THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          And through the glass she sees that-
                         
          The Station is coming straight at her and it looks as though-
                         
          THEY'RE ABOUT TO COLLIDE.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, no. No, no, no.
                         
          She presses the joystick.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The Soyuz is two meters away from the Station, about to crash,
                         WHEN-
                         
          The SOFT JETS ignite, launching the vessel upwards.
                         
          The Soyuz skims just over the Docking Module and passes three
          inches away from the solar panels, barely avoiding a collision
          with the metal giant.
                         
          And as the Soyuz drifts upwards, the Station passes under it.
                         
                         
          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          Now Ryan can see through-
                         
                         THE PORTHOLE-
          The parachute is tangled with a solar panel and the ropes are
          tensing up, and-
                         
          SHE'S SHAKEN BY A NEW PULL.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The Soyuz stabilizes over the Station, the parachute entwined
          with the solar panel.
                         
                         
          SOYUZ. CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          She looks out at-
                         
                         THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          The rope extends from the cabin to the parachute tangled with
          the Station.
                         
                          RYAN
           Great. Fantastic. Perfect.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
                         SILENCE
                         
          The Station hovers below the Soyuz like a large whale swimming
          beneath a tiny lifeboat.
                         
          The HATCH of the Soyuz OPENS.
                         
          Ryan comes out of the craft into space. She's wearing the space
          suit she packed and she carries a large bag.
                         
          She holds onto handles as she floats, SAFELY TETHERED to the
          inside of the cabin.
                         
          She LOOKS around-
                         
          The International Space Station is a looming presence floating
          ten meters below. It is pulling the Soyuz by its parachute.
                         
          An ALARM on her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been 85 MINUTES.
                         
          She turns the alarm off and looks around.
                         
                          RYAN
           Clear skies but with a chance of
           satellite debris.
          SHE HUMS A SONG, the tune is reminiscent of the Hank Williams
          Melody that Matt had played earlier.
                         
          She begins to climb around the vessel. With plenty of oxygen in
          her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task.
                         
          She pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around
          the Soyuz and reaching-
                         
          THE PARACHUTE CONTAINER-
                         
          An impact has blown open the cover. Three ropes float out of the
          container into space. Three meters away from the vessel each
          rope branches into dozens of parachute strings. Next to it-
                         
          A second cover is also badly damaged.
                         
          Harnessing herself to a handle, she inspects the ropes. The
          three ropes are bolted to the container's frame.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay. We detach this and we go home.
           Piece of cake.
                         
          She harnesses the bag and RESUMES her HUMMING, louder this time.
                         
          She unzips the bag and takes out the PISTOL GRIP tool, without
          noticing that behind her-
                         
          DOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass, zooming less than thirty meters
          away from the Station.
                         
          A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the
          Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to
          tremble.
                         
          She places the tool against the FIRST BOLT, stretching her arm
          into the parachute container. It is an awkward position.
                         
          She pulls the trigger and the drill rotates, turning the bolt,
          but it slides out of the notch.
                         
          She places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the
          trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER this time.
                         
          She HUMS under her breath and SWEAT begins to drop down her
          forehead.
                         
          She is very focused, unaware that behind her-
                         
          DEBRIS HITS THE STATION'S SOLAR PANEL, piercing holes through
          it.
                         
          THE BOLT COMES OFF.
          As it FLOATS OFF into space, Ryan drops the PISTOL GRIP and uses
          both hands to detach the rope from the frame.
                         
          The ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz, undulating like a long
          snake, but-
                         
          Ryan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away.
                         
          She stretches her arm trying to catch it, but it is out of her
          reach.
                         
          She pushes herself towards the pistol grip, and barely manages
          to grab onto it when she sees-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Oh shit.
                         
          THE TIDE OF DEBRIS is floating STRAIGHT AT HER.
                         
          She pulls herself back to the container.
                         
          DEBRIS HITS THE STATION.
                         
          It CRASHES in SILENCE against one of its modules, creating a
          hole the size of a car wheel. The vacuum sucks BLUE FLAMES from
          the station that quickly die without oxygen to consume.
                         
          Ryan brings the pistol-grip to the SECOND BOLT and pulls the
          trigger. The bolt spins.
                         
          Ryan is HUMMING louder and louder.
                         
          Ryan stares intently at the head of the bolt turning as the
          debris zooms by behind her.
                         
          THE SECOND BOLT COMES OFF.
                         
          She quickly pulls the rope loose from the frame and lets it
          float away.
                         
          Shaken by the impacts, the Space Station drags the Soyuz with
          it.
                         
          She braces herself as-
                         
          DEBRIS WREAKS HAVOC- some pieces hit the Station, others crash
          against one another. Each collision creates more debris that
          ricochet and fly away in all directions.
                         
          The Soyuz is pulled by the remaining parachute rope, as the
          Station spins out of control.
                         
          Ryan starts humming even louder, the bravado is full tilt now.
          Her face is now covered in sweat, which pours into her eyes,
          making it difficult to see as she unscrews the last bolt.
                         
          Behind her, a cluster of debris PIERCES THE PARACHUTE.
                         
          Ryan continues drilling as-
                         
          MORE DEBRIS HIT THE STATION.
                         
          It CRASHES against the Japanese Lab, which silently EXPLODES
          into millions of pieces. The pieces expand away from the
          Station.
                         
          THE LAST BOLT COMES OFF.
                         
          Ryan manages to unhook the rope, freeing the Soyuz from the
          collapsing Space Station.
                         
          She braces herself against the vessel, as she sees-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Shit!
                         
          The Soyuz is heading straight towards the Station's Solar
          Panels.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           No... no... no..
                         
          The Soyuz' Solar Panel collides with the Station's, shattering
          into smaller pieces of debris that almost hit Ryan.
                         
          The Soyuz spins away as-
                         
          MORE DEBRIS HITS THE STATION.
                         
          Ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper the
          slowly revolving Station segments. As the segments crumble,
          colliding with additional debris, the fragments glimmer
          magnificently then join...
                         
          ...the THINNING TIDE OF DEBRIS orbiting toward the dark side of
          the Earth. All of a sudden...
                         
          EVERYTHING IS CALM.
                         
          She pauses, blinking into the suddenly empty distance. Her gaze
          remains fixed on the vast nothingness--for no good reason--but
          nevertheless FIXED on something.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I hate space.
          SOYUZ SPACECRAFT. CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          A SYMPHONY OF ALARMS shrieks loudly. The hatch FLIES open and a
          helmet floats in, followed quickly by Ryan.
                         
                          RYAN
           Shut up!
                         
          She presses different buttons, and with each a voice of the
          alarm symphony dies until they are completely silent.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ok.
                         
          She takes a breath and begins fastening the seat belt.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Alright. That's good.
                         
          She puts on the communication headset and-
                         
          Resets the STOPWATCH- 85 minutes and counting down.
                         
          She checks the TEMPERATURE GAUGE-
                         
          She exhales, the plume of her hot breath hanging briefly in the
          frigid cabin air before evaporating.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, let's stabilise you.
                         
          She takes the JOYSTICK.
                         
          Ryan looks focused at-
                         
                         THE PERISCOPE-
                         
          Where the western horizon comes into frame and nears the center
          crosshair.
                         
          A small dot GLIMMERS in the distance- THE CHINESE STATION.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station.
           Houston in the blind, Tiangong is
           approximately 100km... to the west and I
           am off it's course by about 3 degrees.
           I will correct trajectory.
                         
          She moves the Joystick, and the crosshair readjusts.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ok.
          She releases the safety lock and places her finger on the
          button.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five...
           four... three
                         
          She releases the safety lock.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           two... one...
                         
          She pushes on the button.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          The Soyuz floats with its nose directed towards a bright star on
          the horizon, the Chinese Station, but-
                         
          Nothing, not even a small flame, comes out of its back
          thrusters.
                         
                         
          CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          Ryan waits, expectantly, and gives the button a NEW PUSH, but-
                         
                          RYAN
           One...
                         
          Nothing. The thruster won't ignite.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           One... one...
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          The vessel remains motionless, orbiting over the Pacific which
          is already under night's dark veil.
                         
                         
          CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          She pushes again, and again, and again-
                         
                          RYAN
           Come on. Come on!
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          But NOTHING.
          The Soyuz stays in place.
                         
                         
          CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          Ryan looks at the FUEL GAUGE- 30 percent.
                         
          She taps on it and the frozen needle drops to EMPTY.
                         
                          RYAN
           You gotta be kidding me.
                         
          She taps on the frozen dial once more, as if trying to get the
          needle to go back up, and once again-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Where's your backup?
                         
          She taps even harder this time.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Where's your goddamn backup?!
                         
          She bangs down on the control panel in frustration--
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
                          FU--
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE. 300 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          Inside the capsule, through the portal, Ryan hits and hits,
          bouncing around the confined space of the cabin and venting all
          her anger, until she herself is out of fuel.
                         
          She grabs the radio and-
                         
                          RYAN
           This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear
           me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can
           you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is
           Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy?
                         
          THE SUN SETS.
                         
          A magical cosmic act. As the sun nears the edge of the Earth,
          the atmosphere brightens, shining with a luminous orange light
          that is reflected off the surface of the Pacific Ocean.
                         
          At the Soyuz's orbiting speed this does not last long. The sun
          quickly dips behind the edge of the Earth and the whole face of
          the planet is in shadow.
          The vessel is almost lost in the deep black of night.
          Fluorescent green light pours out of the porthole, like a lonely
          firefly lost in the deep of night.
                         
                         
          CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          And the night has brought with it its cold grip.
                         
          Ryan shivers and her voice is now weak, but she continues
          searching for help-
                         
                          RYAN
           Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you
           hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan
           Stone, can you hear me? Copy?
                         
                         
          She turns her neck stiffly, looks at the-
                         
          TEMPERATURE DIAL, -8 degrees and dropping. Through the PORTHOLE
          the SUN drops. DARKNESS descends.
                         
          Finally, a SOUND SURFACES through the static:
                         
          A CRACKLING.
                         
          The CRACKLING SOUND is coming from the communication headset.
          Ryan puts it on and brings the mouthpiece to her lips.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Houston. Houston! This is Mission
           Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy!
                         
          This glimmer of hope gives her a new burst of energy.
                         
          She TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT and attempts to tune into the
          frequency, turning one of the control panel's dials. She frowns.

          Ryan begins to HOWL, giving in to the mad joy of it all.
          Moments later, through the RADIO, she is joined by a CHORUS of
          CANINES--Aningang's DOGS--TUNING INTO HER VOICE in a mad, crazy
          harmonic cacophony. Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with
          abandon.
                         
          Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking
          emotions that have been festering over time, and-
                         
          TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her
          lashes and floating INTO THE AIR, glimmering LIKE SAPPHIRES in
          the cool moonlight.
                         
          They float away, like tiny satellites orbiting her face.
                         
          Aningang can be heard intermittently, YELLING, as if trying to
          silence the dogs. Then the dogs, one by one, cease their wailing
          and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice.
                         
          She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue
          light.

           No one will mourn me. No one will pray
           for my soul. Will you mourn me,
           Aningang? Is it too late to say a
           prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I
           have never prayed in my life... no one
           ever taught me how...

          eyes.
                         
          Ryan's face grows slack as she drifts toward unconsciousness,
          buoyed along on Aningang's sad soulful song. Then...
                         
          ...a SPUTTERING CRY cuts through the static.

          Ryan is transfixed, listening to the gentle gurgle of the baby
          as Aningang coos to it, then begins to SING again.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)

          Painful memories flash before her, haunting her. Ryan's lump in
          her throat is washed away by a gentle sob.

          The Oxygen in the cabin's atmosphere begins to drop.
                         
          SHE TURNS OFF THE LIGHT.
                         
          Ryan closes her eyes, simply listening to the lullaby as it
          grows fainter...
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)

          For a long beat Ryan merely sits there. She is gently humming a
          tune.
                         
          It is a LULLABY.

          SHE WEEPS.
                         
          A quiet deep sorrow that silently grows in intensity and that
          finally explodes into-
                         
          A SOFT WAIL.
                         
          TEARS float around her like tiny satellites.
                         
          The cold and the gentle humming of the Soyuz cradles Ryan.
                         
          She closes her eyes, and as her breathing relaxes she begins to
          fall asleep, until-

                         THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          THROUGH THE GLASS, the helmet of an astronaut is looking in.

          Ryan immediately straps herself to the commander chair.
                         
          The latch keeps turning.
                         
          Ryan covers her eyes and face with her hands when-

          THE HATCH SWINGS OPEN.
                         
          The VACUUM of space sucks in one sharp gust all the air inside
          the cabin and with it every sound.
                         
          The straps hold Ryan back as objects gush out through the hatch.
          Her hands press tightly covering her face.
                         
          On the Control Panel alarms begin to flash.
                         
          A SHADOWY FIGURE makes its way in and with one sharp motion-
                         
          Turns and closes the hatch. Presses a green button and-
                         
          The cabin begins to pressurize.
                         
          And sound re-emerges with the beeping of the alarms as-
                         
          The red-orange-green graph on the control panel show the
          atmospheric levels reaching green.
                         
          Ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the
          figure, who straps into the seat next to her. He unlocks the
          ring around his collar and-
                         
          TAKES OFF HIS HELMET.
                         
          COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC escapes into the cabin.
                         
                          MATT
           Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13
           hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell
           him he's been bumped.
                         
          The figure glances around.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little
           light?
                         
          He taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms:
                         
          Matt.
                         
          Ryan stares, mouth agape.
                         
                          RYAN
           How did you?
                         
                          MATT
           Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
                          RYAN
           But how did you?
                         
          He reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of
          switches. Instantly, the alarms go silent.
                         
                          MATT
           That's better.
                         
                          RYAN
           How?
                         
          Ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how-
                         
                          MATT
           I found a little extra battery power.
           I'm just happy you're still alive. To
           be honest, I thought your chances were
           slim to none. By the way, did you find
           the vodka?
                         
                          RYAN
           You never told me where.
                         
          Matt fishes a SMALL FLASK from under his seat, spins off the
          cap...
                         
                          MATT
           Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje.
                         
          ...and takes a big gulp. He offers the flask to Ryan, who
          appears to be dozing off. She blinks, shakes her head.
                         
                          RYAN
           No.
                         
          He studies her.
                         
                          MATT
           No? Right, let's get out of here.
                         
          He looks at the monitors, where the Chinese Station is seen.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           We're `bout a hundred miles to the
           Chinese Station. A little Sunday
           drive.
                         
                          RYAN
           We can't.
                         
                          MATT
           Course we can.
                          RYAN
           There's no fuel. I tried everything.
                         
                          MATT
           Well, there's always something we can
           do.
                         
                          RYAN
           I tried everything.
                         
                          MATT
           Did you try the soft landing jets?
                         
                          RYAN
           They're for landing so.
                         
                          MATT
           Well landing is launching it's the
           same thing, didn't you learn about
           that in training?
                         
                          RYAN
           I never got to land the simulator, I
           told you.
                         
                          MATT
           But you know about it.
                         
                          RYAN
           And I crashed it every time.
                         
          Ryan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off.
                         
                          MATT
           Listen you want to go back or do you
           want to stay here? I get it, it's nice
           up here, you can just shut down all
           the systems turn out all the lights,
           and just close your eyes and tune out
           everybody.
                         
          Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the
          cabin lights off.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           There's nobody up here who can hurt
           you, it's safe. Then what's the point
           in going on, what's the point of
           living?
                         
          When the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan.
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher
           than that, but still it's a
           matter of what you do now. If you
           decide to go that you've gotta just
           get on with it, sit back enjoy the
           ride. You have to start living life,
           Ryan.
                         
          Ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open.
                         
                          RYAN
           How did you get here?
                         
                          MATT
           Ryan, you have to learn to let go ...
           Hey?
                         
          Ryan is almost sound asleep.
                         
                          RYAN
           What?
                         
          Ryan is asleep.
                         
                          MATT
           It's time to go home.
                         
          Her eyes snap open.
                         
          Her gaze shifts. The flask is floating in front of her. But no
          Matt. She turns. THE CABIN IS EMPTY. She turns back.
                         
          CLICK CLICK CLICK.
                         
          Ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is shaking,
          making a percussive sound.
                         
          A SOFT COOL LIGHT shines in through the condensation that has
          frozen on the glass. It is-
                         
          THE MOONLIGHT caressing Ryan's face.
                         
                          RYAN
           Landing, landing. Landing is
           launching.
                         
          With a new surge of determination she TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT.
                         
          She pulls the HELMET floating above her and puts it on.
                         
          She connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the Oxygen Valve,
          and begins to breath.
          As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of
          determination brightens her face.
                         
          She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing
          Oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin.
                         
          She grabs the MANUAL.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, landing, landing, landing is
           green.
                         
          She opens the green binder and browses through its index.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, okay landing, alright.
                         
          She stops, turns some pages and stares closely at the manual.
                         
          Ryan notices the Energy Bar floating by her. She grabs it and as
          she opens the wrapper, she stares intently at one page of the
          MANUAL, where there is-
                         
                         A DIAGRAM-
                         
          An ILLUSTRATION of the Soyuz Capsule two meters before landing
          and hitting the ground. A thrust is shooting out from under its
          bottom, cushioning its fall: THE SOFT LANDING ENGINES.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Soft landing jets trigger
           automatically at three meters before
           landing. ... you're a clever son of a
           bitch Matt. So to land I need to get
           rid of the BO and Engine module, okay?
                         
          She puts on the communication headset.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Listen to me Matt. You're going to see
           a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah,
           her hair is probably a mess. That's
           okay, she doesn't like to brush it.
                         
          She looks out of the porthole, down at Earth.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She
           was so upset about that shoe Matt, but
           tell her it was right under the bed.
                         
          She turns back to the console and places her finger over one of
          the buttons.
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           You give her a big hug and a kiss for
           me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell
           her she's my little angel and that she
           makes me so proud, so so so proud, and
           that I promise I'll try and make her
           proud too. You tell her that I'm not
           quitting, that I'm going to keep
           fighting. You tell her I love her
           Matt... I love her so much.
                         
          Ryan smiles, remembering... and then-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tri module separation, go...
                         
                         
          She presses the button.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          The locks connecting the three modules of the Soyuz release.
                         
          CONTROL CABIN, AIRLOCK, and the ENGINES SEPARATE.
                         
          A mechanism pushes the CONTROL CABIN away from the AIRLOCK and
          the ENGINES, and it slowly gains distance from them.
                         
                         
          CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          Ryan scans through the complicated charts and diagrams in the
          manual.
                         
                          RYAN
           Okay Houston, here comes the tricky
           part, the Soyuz has to think we're
           only three meters above the earth.
                         
                         
          A pause, and then-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Let's reset you then.
                         
          Using the manual as a reference, Ryan uses the cursors to select
          the ALTITUDE DISPLAY on the computer screen.
                         
          The current ALTITUDE is- 2600 M.
                         
          She uses the cursors and presses a button. A WARNING on the
          computer screen comes on.
          She presses another button, and-
                         
          ON THE SCREEN, the ALTITUDE goes blank.
                         
          Ryan punches a new set of commands.
                         
          The ALTITUDE now reads- 3 meters.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay. I only have one shot at this.
           One shot...
                         
          She extends her finger...
                         
                          RYAN(CONT'D)
           What's the point if we don't try?
                         
          SHE PRESSES THE BUTTON.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          A THREE SECOND THRUST ignites at the back of the cabin, pushing
          it at great speeds toward the Chinese Station.
                         
                         
          SOYUZ CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          The strength of the thrust pushes Ryan back in her seat.
                         
          She looks at-
                         
                         THE PERISCOPE-
                         
          The Soyuz is approaching the Tiangong. The center of the
          crosshair is aiming three degrees above the Chinese Station.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          The Soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the Chinese Station.
                         
                         
          CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          Ryan is looking out of the window, at Earth-
                         
                          RYAN
           Wow... you were right Matt... it's
           magnificent....
                         
          She then turns to-
                         
                         THE PERISCOPE-
          The Chinese Station quickly grows in size as the Soyuz gets
          closer and closer.
                         
          ALTITUDE DIAL- 155 km and dropping.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You
           keep dropping and you're going to kiss
           the atmosphere. But not before I get
           to you. You have my last ride home.
                         
          A new sense of urgency comes up on Ryan's face.
                         
          She unhooks the umbilical from her suit.
                         
          She unstraps herself.
                         
          She floats over and looks out of-
                         
                         THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          The Chinese Station is approaching, getting closer.
                         
          She disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the LATCH.
                         
          She pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it
          tightly against her chest with one arm. With the other arm-
                         
          She reaches for the Latch.
                         
          The Station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going
          to pass it.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, I'm done with just driving.
           Let's get go home.
                         
          She turns the latch, and-
                         
          PYROTECHNICS shoot the porthole into space.
                         
          The brutal force of the infinite VACUUM of space SUCKS THE AIR
          out of the cabin, and-
                         
          Ryan is LAUNCHED out of the cabin at a tremendous speed.
                         
          SHE HITS HER SHOULDER as she goes through the hatch into-
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          A CANNONBALL WOMAN is launched up from the Soyuz's hatch. She
          passes the Chinese Station as she twirls up toward the Heavens.
          The Soyuz continues its straight trajectory toward Earth.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          Ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain.
                         OUTSIDE-
                         
          Everything twirls.
                         
          Earth and Heavens.
                         
          An ALARM in her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been EIGHTY-FIVE MINUTES.
                         
          And she spins and sees-
                         
          THE TIANGONG, one mile below her. And below it-
                         
          A bright comet leaves behind a yellow scratch over the Earth. It
                         IS-
                         
          THE SOYUZ BURNING upon contact with the atmosphere.
                         
          Ryan drifts away. She holds tightly to the fire extinguisher
          with one hand, and with the other she checks her right shoulder.
                         
          IT HURTS.
                         
          But there's no time, the Tiangong is getting farther away. She
          points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and
                         TRIGGERS A-
                         
                         SPRAY-
                         
          It acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the Station. It
          helped, but she is still off target.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          She is in pain.
                         
          The glass visor is steaming up.
                         
          She begins HUMMING as she looks at-
                         
          The Station drifting ahead, less than five hundred meters away.
                         
          From this distance the damage caused to the Tiangong by the
          debris is clear. The solar panels are shredded to pieces, and
          several modules appear to have been badly hit.
                         
                         RYAN GIVES-
                         
                         ANOTHER SPRAY-
          Propelling herself even closer to the Station.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          She stops humming. Her breath is fogging up the glass, giving
          her a blurred view of-
                         
          The Station, which is less than a hundred meters away. She can
                         SEE THAT-
                         
          The LIFEBOAT, the SHENZHOU, a vessel very similar to the Soyuz,
          is docked on a module.
                         
          It's now clear that she's not flying straight toward the
          Station.
                         
          Ryan attempts to correct her trajectory by giving-
                         
                         ANOTHER SPRAY-
                         
          But only a very SMALL THRUST comes out of the extinguisher, not
          enough to push her on the right track.
                         
          She PULLS the trigger again-
                         
          But only a few dust particles come out. The extinguisher is
          empty. She lets go of it and it floats away.
                         
          She drifts toward the Station, SLOWLY.
                         
          She is less than twenty meters away, and getting closer.
                         
          AND CLOSER.
                         
          And she misses it by a hair.
                         
          She drifts, very slowly, two meters above the Station.
                         
          Her arm, outstretched, tries to grab hold of anything it can.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          Ryan winces in pain and looks at-
                         
          Her outstretched arm reaching toward-
                         
                         THE STATION-
                         
          She slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers
          almost touching the surface of the Tiangong.
                         
          A handle passes under her, almost within reach, but she does not
          manage to hold onto it.
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          She's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it. She
          looks ahead at-
                         
                         THE STATION-
                         
          A solar panel, following the rotation of the Station, comes into
          view.
                         
          She stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it.
                         
          But the solar panel continues its rotation and she is
          approaching very slowly.
                         
          The panel is rotating away.
                         
          She STRETCHES, and-
                         
          She GRABS onto a rod on the Solar Panel, STOPPING her momentum.
                         
          Ryan hangs from the Station. She holds her right arm tightly to
          her chest.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          She catches her breath and is clearly in pain.
                         
                         RYAN SEES-
                         
          A LONESOME PIECE OF DEBRIS.
                         
          It hovers above the Station and glows as the sunlight hits its
          surface. It passes very quickly.
                         
          And there's ANOTHER ONE cruising farther above.
                         
          She pulls her right arm up.
                         
                          RYAN
           Ahhhhhh!
                         
          The pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod,
                         AND-
                         
          SHE PULLS HERSELF UP, and clinging with her leg, she secures
          herself to the panel.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          She's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far
          away over the horizon-
                         
          BRIGHT DOTS.
          Pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere. A swarm of
          incandescent locusts that-
                         
          Is coming directly at her.
                         
          Ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible,
          she climbs up to-
                         
          THE BODY OF THE STATION.
                         
          She goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling
          herself from handle to handle.
                         
          When she reaches the end of it, with one last BIG PULL she makes
          it to the-
                         
          HATCH that leads into the airlock.
                         
          With her bad arm she holds onto a handle.
                         
          With the other, she pulls on the latch and-
                         
          OPENS THE AIRLOCK.
                         
          A gust of AIR bursts out, pushing the hatch wide open.
                         
          Ryan holds on tightly to the handle.
                         
                         ABOVE HER-
                         
          Clusters of DEBRIS pass by, flying at different distances and at
          great speeds.
                         
          Pieces COLLIDE with each other, exploding into more debris.
                         
          A BIG PIECE OF DEBRIS is flying downward, missing the Station by
          ten meters as it continues its descent. And-
                         
          250 meters below, it BURNS like a shooting star.
                         
          The Station is rapidly approaching Earth's atmosphere.
                         
          And over the Eastern horizon-
                         
          A CLOUD OF DUST is quickly approaching.
                         
          THE TIDE OF DEBRIS.
                         
                         
          TIANGONG. AIRLOCK. 150 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          Ryan secures the hatch.
          The airlock is smaller than the one in the International Space
          Station but, like the ISS, there is a small control panel on one
          side.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          The glass is almost fogged up. She makes her way to the-
                         
                         CONTROL PANEL-
                         
          The red, yellow, and green graph is bright red. Under it, TWO
          BUTTONS with Chinese ideograms on them.
                         
                          AND
                         
          Her finger hesitates as she takes a wild guess.
                         
                         SHE PRESSES-
                         
                         
                         
          A FAINT HISSING SOUND is heard.
                         
          THE CABIN PRESSURIZES.
                         
          As oxygen fills the space-
                         
          SOUND BEGINS TO EMERGE.
                         
          Unrecognizable at first is a rhythmic pattern under a syncopated
          murmur. But as air allows sound to conduct its waves, it becomes
          clear.
                         
          AN ALARM IS GOING OFF.
                         
          Over it a recording plays in a LOOP. It is in Mandarin. The
          VOICE in the recording is urgent. Clearly it is not good news.
                         
                          LOOP
                         
                         
          She's in pain and more tired than ever now, and she's punchy.
                         
                          LOOP (CONT'D)
                         
                         
          She waits, floating.
                         
          INSIDE THE HELMET-
                         
          The glass is completely fogged up. Through the condensation, she
          can only discern a RED LIGHT filtering through.
          She waits.
                         
                          RYAN
           Come on. Come on.
                         
          And when the RED GLOW turns to ORANGE-
                         
          Ryan UNLOCKS her helmet and, using only her left hand, struggles
          to take it off.
                         
          As the helmet floats, bouncing off of the cabin walls, Ryan
          massages her injured shoulder. She does this gently, as even the
          smallest pressure inflicts pain.
                         
          The orange light is turning green when-
                         
          She feels the Station quake fiercely, reverberating through the
          handle she's holding onto.
                         
          THE STATION RUMBLES.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          The Tiangong is plummeting.
                         
          The tip of a solar panel is already grazing over the outer
          layers of the atmosphere, leaving a trail behind it as it parts
          the gases.
                         
          DEBRIS passing under the Station burn up.
                         
                         
          TIANGONG NODE 1.
                         
          EVERYTHING SHAKES.
                         
          Ryan rushes out of the airlock.
                         
          A new intensity sparkles in her eyes. Her fearlessness and
          determination are bordering with madness.
                         
          She inspects her surroundings. Through a hatch she sees a long
          corridor-like cabin that leads to another node. It is the LAB
          MODULE.
                         
          The LOOP keeps on playing.
                         
                          LOOP
                         
                         
                         
          She enters the hatch into the-
          TIANGONG LAB MODULE.
                         
          The only light is coming from flickering emergency lights.
          Objects float in chaos.
                         
          Ryan makes her way, dodging the disarray of lab objects-
                         
          Scientific instruments: A plant drifting by with its roots
          exposed, clusters of liquid floating like wobbly spheres, two
          eggs hovering, one of which is broken.
                         
          THE SHAKING INTENSIFIES as-
                         
          She reaches the end of the module and goes into the-
                         
                         
          TIANGONG NODE 2.
                         
          She floats to the center of the node.
                         
          There are three open hatches- RIGHT, LEFT, and-
                         
                         BELOW-
                         
          A Docking Module, very similar to the one in the ISS. At the far
          end of it an open hatch leads into the SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          MORE RUMBLING SHAKES THE STATION.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          A SOLAR PANEL, defeated by the friction with the atmosphere,
          breaks off from the Station and is thrown farther down, where it
          quickly burns, dissolving into sparks.
                         
          The TIDAL WAVE of debris is catching up with the Station, a
          cloud of metal pieces that sparkle with the sunlight.
                         
          BRIGHT STREAKS can be seen as debris burns, scratching through
          the atmosphere.
                         
                         
          TIANGONG NODE 2.
                         
          Ryan springs into the-
                         
          DOCKING MODULE.
                         
          Floating through it and reaching the open hatch at the other
          end, she tosses the helmet inside the Shenzhou.
                         
          A LOUD METALLIC ROAR. The Station is collapsing. She dives
          through the hatch into the-
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. AIRLOCK.
                         
          It is almost identical to the Soyuz's airlock.
                         
          She does a quick flip and-
                         
          CLOSES the outer hatch.
                         
          Then she pulls on another latch and-
                         
          CLOSES the inner hatch.
                         
          The Shenzhou is SEALED OFF from the rest of the Station.
                         
          She throws the helmet into the Control Cabin and follows
          through, into the-
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD. CONTROL CABIN.
                         
          She struggles to turn around in the confined space, and then-
                         
          She pulls the hatch CLOSED.
                         
          THE CONTROL CABIN IS SEALED.
                         
          The Shenzhou is smaller than the Soyuz and has only one seat. In
          this confined space, the SHAKING of the station is felt even
          stronger.
                         
          She sits, BUCKLES herself in, and looks at the-
                         
          CONTROL PANEL.
                         
          It has more monitors than the Soyuz's panel, and the main board
          is arranged differently. All of the buttons are labeled with
          CHINESE IDEOGRAMS.
                         
          AND IT IS SHAKING FIERCELY.
                         
                          RYAN
           Seriously?
                         
                         THROUGH-
                         
                         THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          A thin bright yellow halo covers the whole window.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          The yellow halo envelops the whole Station as it glides over the
          outer atmosphere.
          FRICTION.
                         
          The remaining SOLAR PANEL resists breaking off from the
          structure, but still goes up in flames, leaving a trail of
          SPARKS.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          EVERYTHING IS SHAKING.
                         
                          RYAN
           In the Soyuz the power button is
           erm....here!
                         
          She passes her finger over the board, trying to make sense of
          the buttons.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ah, ok ah undocking,
           undocking....eenie, meenie,...
                         
                         SHE PRESSES
                         
          An ALARM RINGS, and under the ongoing LOOP, a RECORDING, clearly
          warning.
                         
                          RECORDING
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Ok. That doesn't sound good....
                         
          She glances around frantically, turns it off.
                         
          It's shaking very intensely but she's wide-eyed now, clearly
          close to being beside herself.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Miini... moh...
                         
          She tries a BIG BUTTON that says-
                         
          A NEW ALARM, followed by a NEW RECORDING, also a warning-
                         
          And with a horrible accent-
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           No hablo chino.
                         
          She keeps searching for the right button.
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Mini... moh...
                         
          And she presses a new one.
                         
          The LIGHTS on the Control Panel GO ON. The cabin makes a humming
          sound as SYSTEMS BEGIN TO ACTIVATE.
                         
          On the control panel lights go on in patterns reminiscent of the
          switchboard in the Soyuz.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay....okay...
                         
          She begins going through the progressions she used on the Soyuz,
          only quicker this time, jabbing button after button.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Good...good...There. And this should
           be...
                         
          She presses one more button and systems turn to green.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay... Houston in the blind...
                         
          She raises her voice to be heard over the GROWING RUMBLE.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone
           reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about
           to undock from the Tiangong and I have
           a bad feeling about this mission.
                         
          She presses a new button and the system goes to green. And on
          the MONITOR a COUNTDOWN appears.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Reminds me of a story, Houston--
                         
          She reacts to a bad shake of the cabin.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, you know what, Houston? Never
           mind the story...
                         
          She looks around as the cabin starts shaking even harder.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           It's getting hotter in here.
                         
          She watches the COUNTDOWN on the MONITOR- 3:59... 3:58...
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           The way I figure it, there's only two
                          POSSIBLE OUTCOMES--
                         
          Ryan keeps her eyes fixed on the countdown. Raises her voice to
          compete with the rising chaos...
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I either make it down in one piece and
           I'll have one hell of a story to
           tell...
                         
          And now the noise and the shake are nearing their peak...
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           ...Or I burn up in the next ten
           minutes.
                         
          Ryan smiles, flips the safety lid of a button open.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Whichever way it goes, no harm no
           foul.
                         
          As the cabin RATTLES VIOLENTLY.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Because either way--
                         
          She closes her eyes, puts her finger over the button.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           It'll be one hell of a ride.
                         
          Ryan presses the button.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I'm ready.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          The Station is bouncing over the atmosphere. One end of it is
          glowing more brightly and catches FIRE.
                         
          The TIDE OF DEBRIS is getting closer. Not far off some pieces
          are already burning.
                         
          A LARGE PIECE OF DEBRIS has caught on fire and is flying at
          great speed and-
                         
          COLLIDES WITH THE STATION,
          Tearing it into two parts, which are sent twisting in opposite
          directions. The ESCAPE POD, attached to the DOCK, is spinning
          towards earth.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          Ryan is SHAKEN and RATTLED in her seat.
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeehaaa!
                         
          GRAVITY is still minimal, but the force of the inertia is rough
          and it jerks her around. She sees-
                         
          A RED LEVER above her, but she can only reach it with her bad
          hand.
                         
                         SHE STRETCHES
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ahhhhhhhh!
                         
          SHE GRABS THE LEVER-
                         
          AND PULLS IT.
                         
                         
          OUTER SPACE.
                         
          THE LOCKS DISENGAGE-
                         
          THE CABIN separates from the rest of the vessel and from the
          Station. It spins away, plummeting toward the atmosphere.
                         
          The two fragments of the Tiangong follow, spinning in a rage of
          sparks and fire.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          The spinning is punishing. Ryan is shaken violently. She is also
          mumbling words to herself that we can't hear. It looks like she
          rambling.
                         
          Some LIGHTS GO OFF.
                         
                         
          ATMOSPHERE. 130 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The capsule's aerodynamics slow down the spinning, positioning
          the vessel nose up.
                         
          It cuts through the atmosphere at incredible speeds.
          Its metal is burning hot.
                         
          Smoldering DEBRIS and the fragments of the STATION chase the
          Shenzhou in its descent.

                         THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          A blinding light pours in from outside the window.
                         
          The spinning is over, but the cabin vibrates with a loud rumble.
                         
          As the G-Force restrains Ryan against her seat, she clenches her
          face and sweats.
                         
          On the ceiling, condensation begins to form.
                         
                         
          ATMOSPHERE. 120 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The Shenzhou is a ball of fire precipitating from the skies.
                         
          It's followed very closely by DEBRIS and the two fragments of
          the STATION.
                         
          The TWO FRAGMENTS COLLIDE and EXPLODE into a ball of fire that
          breaks into many pieces.
                         
          An avalanche of fire cascades towards the Shenzhou, rapidly
          closing the distance.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          In THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          Outside burning debris is passing by. The gravitational pull
          keeps Ryan tense in her seat as drops fall on her face. She
                         LOOKS AT-
                         
          THE CEILING- where condensation is dripping.
                         
                         
          ATMOSPHERE. 100 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The avalanche is about to swallow the cabin when the burning
          debris disintegrates before reaching the cooling STRATOSPHERE.
                         
          The capsule escapes the inferno as the debris crumbles in a
          final explosion expelling-
                         
          A VERY SMALL PIECE OF DEBRIS that-
          SHOOTS towards the Shenzhou and-
                         
          SKIMS its surface, tearing one of the outer shields.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          The impact is felt inside and a panel falls off. A small smoke
          trail is formed around its wires.
                         
          Ryan is restrained against her seat by the gravitational force
          of the fall and-
                         
          EVERYTHING IS SHAKING.
                         
                         
          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 70 KM ABOVE EARTH.
                         
          The Shenzhou has left the burning debris behind.
                         
          As it touches the lower atmosphere, it immediately COOLS DOWN,
          dimming its brightness, surrounded by a purple sky.
                         
          It FREEFALLS 9.8 meters per second and-
                         
          A PARACHUTE RELEASES.
                         
          The long fabric comes out and EXPANDS as the air fills the red
          and white canopy. When it's fully open it SLOWS DOWN the cabin's
          descent and lets it glide in a diagonal path over the Earth.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          A BREATH OF RELIEF, as through THE PORTHOLE-
                         
          She sees the ropes of the parachute extend out to the large
          canvas cushioning the fall.
                         
                         
          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 10 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          A SECOND PARACHUTE expands.
                         
          It slows the fall even further, shifting the cabin into a more
          vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now seems
          tangible.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          Ryan starts COUGHING.
                         
          The cabin is quickly filling with SMOKE, and-
          The white cloud of smoke overflowing the small space is getting
          thicker.
                         
                         
          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 1 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The Shenzhou drops, hanging from the parachutes, at a speed of
          thirty kilometers per hour.
                         
          It is surrounded by a blue sky. It passes through a layer of
          clouds.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          She coughs as the white smoke is becoming unbearable. She's
          suffocating.
                         
                         
          LOWER ATMOSPHERE. 100 METERS ABOVE THE EARTH.
                         
          The Shenzhou is rapidly approaching the ground.
                         
          It is falling straight toward a lake. Two meters before hitting
                         ITS SURFACE-
                         
          THE LANDING ENGINES IGNITE, giving the downward thrust meant to
          cushion the landing on a hard surface.
                         
          The thrust parts the water, creating a curtain of steam, and the
          Shenzhou gently falls down-
                         
          INTO THE LAKE-
                         
          Making a wave that spreads out in a circle.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          Ryan feels the cabin hit the water. She has landed safely.
                         
          But she cannot celebrate because she can't stop coughing. She is
          asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke.
                         
          She UNSTRAPS herself and-
                         
          Reaches a LEVER at the side of the hatch.
                         
          She PULLS THE LEVER.
          ON THE LAKE.
                         
          With a small controlled explosion, the hatch cover is launched
          away from the cabin.
                         
          Smoke pours out through the open hatch.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          She begins to unstrap herself when-
                         
          WATER POURS IN through the open hatch.
                         
          She tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong
          current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and-
                         
          IT PUSHES HER BACK IN.
                         
          She struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly
          filling the cabin, but it is too strong.
                         
          THE CABIN IS OVERFLOWING.
                         
          The water has reached Ryan's chin when-
                         
          She manages to take ONE LAST DEEP BREATH of air before-
                         
          WATER COMPLETELY FILLS IT.
                         
                         
                         UNDERWATER
                         
          The metallic capsule, which weighs almost three tons, sinks
          quickly into the lake. As the ropes of the parachute tense, the
          long fabric follows the cabin down.
                         
                         
          SHENZHOU ESCAPE POD.
                         
          Air trapped inside Ryan's suit leaks out through the collar and
          small bubbles float up.
                         
          Ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm,
          she swims out.
                         
                         
          UNDERWATER.
                         
          She pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the
                         POD AS-
                         
          THE SHENZHOU HITS THE LAKE BOTTOM.
          A dark cloud of mud swells up around it.
                         
          Ryan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface, but she can only use
          one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN.
                         
          She strokes rapidly, but she isn't moving up. Instead-
                         
          SHE'S GOING DOWN, and
                         
          HER FEET SINK INTO THE LAKE BED.
                         
          She looks up and sees-
                         
          The rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are
          eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a
          huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray.
                         
          THE FROG crosses in front of her, effortlessly swimming on its
          way to the surface.
                         
          Small bubbles of air come out of Ryan's nose as she struggles to
          open her suit.
                         
          She takes off the BOTTOM PART of the suit.
                         
                         ABOVE HER-
                         
          THE PARACHUTE IS GETTING CLOSER, a net about to trap her.
                         
          She struggles out of the TOP PART of her suit. And squirming out
          from under it-
                         
          She frees herself from the heavy garments and SWIMS UP as-
                         
          THE SINKING PARACHUTE traps her foot and begins dragging her
          down. But with a kick-
                         
          SHE SETS HERSELF FREE, and-
                         
          SHE SWIMS UP, stroking with her good arm. She is completely out
          of breath, only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose.
                         
          She is about to lose consciousness, when she sees-
                         
          THE FROG swimming ahead of her, sliding smoothly through the
          water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface.
                         
          Ryan's eyes are closed as she floats up, her body limp. The
          surface is coming closer and closer.
                         
          She reaches the thin boundary between water and air and she come
          out to the-
          SURFACE.
                         
          And she takes an enormous breath.
                         
                          RYAN
           AAAHHHHHH!
                         
          Almost primal, like the first breath of a newborn child, it
          burns her lungs but reclaims life.
                         
          She only has enough strength to keep her face above water. She
          FLOATS, catching her breath and taking long gulps of air.
                         
          She looks up at-
                         
                         THE SKY-
                         
          Where the clouds move, caressed by air and light. And beyond
                         THEM-
                         
          OUTER SPACE, but-
                         
          SHE'S BACK ON EARTH.
                         
          She turns around, and-
                         
          TAKING A DEEP BREATH-
                         
          She SWIMS, breaking through the water and harnessing every last
          bit of energy in her.
                         
          And soon she arrives to the-
                         
                         
          SHALLOW EDGE OF THE LAKE
                         
          She drags herself from the water, like the first amphibious life
          form crawling out of the primordial soup onto land.
                         
          COLLAPSES ON THE SHORE.
                         
          The water laps gently over her, washing in and out around her
          legs.
                         
          SHE LIES with her face against the muddy shore and her eyes
          closed, recovering her strength.
                         
          AND SHE BREATHES.
                         
          SHE BREATHES AIR.
                         
          And as her breath steadies-
                         
          SHE SMILES.
          She pushes her face against the ground, enjoying the sense of
          weight, and-
                         
          SHE OPENS HER EYES.
                         
          Then she looks at her surroundings, taking in the almost
          unbearable beauty of the planet Earth.
                         
          She's breathing deeply and begins to cough.
                         
          It's not a cough, it's a chuckle.
                         
          RYAN IS CRACKING UP.
                         
          Ecstasy overcomes Ryan and-
                         
          Joyful laughter fills her body.
                         
          SHE IS ALIVE.
                         
                          RYAN
           Thank you.
                         
          She PLANTS HER PALMS against the ground and-
                         
          With an effort, she pushes herself up.
                         
          SHE FEELS HER WEIGHT, and manages to rise to her hands and knees
          like a four-legged mammal.
                         
          And she STANDS UP.
                         
          ONE FOOT FALLS heavily on the ground. It sinks into the mud and
                         THEN-
                         
          ANOTHER FOOT.
                         
          Ryan's FEET are solidly planted on the mud.

           Ahhhhh!!!
                         
          One foot moves forward and lands on more solid ground, unstable,
          coping with the weight. And then-
                         
          The other foot follows as-
                         
          SHE BEGINS TO WALK ON PLANET EARTH, laughing.
                         
          SHE IS PUNCH DRUNK.
                         
          SHE IS FREE.

          1 EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - MORNING 1

          The same crowded Chinatown street where Rand Peltzer first
          found Gizmo the Mogwai. As LOCALS bustle past, ANGLE FAVORS
          the stairs to the basement curiosity shop.

          2 INT. MR. WING'S STORE

          MR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the
          Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day.
          As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs.

          3 EXT. STREET 3

           PEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short.
           ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed
           -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows.
           FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the 
           limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three
           big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car.
           INT. MR. WING'S STORE tj.
           Mr. Wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep
           into the store.

           Mister Wi Daniel Clamp would
           like to see you.

           The men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of
          the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen
          fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New
          York's most successful real estate developer.

          CLAMP (ON TV)
          Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's
          out through to key issues, okay?
          I'm prepared to increase my offer
          substantially.

          (BEAT)
          Now, Mister Wing, you're attached
          to your business. I appreciate
          that. I'm attached to my own
          business. I develop the biggest
          buildings in New York, and you
          sell, ah, little things. Fine.
          But I'm not just talking about
          money here.
          On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel
          beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the
          grandiose of a huge office building,..

           Take a look, Mister Wing --

          (READS)
          "The Clamp Chinatown Center --
          Where Business Gets Oriented."
          When I put up a building, it's the
          biggest -- it's the newest -- it's
          the best. People are going to be
          killing each other to get into
          this building --
          The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove
          of the store.

           GIZMO (O.S.)
           Tee vee!

           CLAMP (ON TV)
           Now,'we've been able to reach an
           understanding with everyone on the
           block -- except for you. Let me
           show you what I willing to do
           for you -- a s tand and
           souvenir cone on, right here

           make the building look like
           a ghost town.

           Mr. Wing regards the video image impassively. 


           CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.)
           Please IF us know when you've 
          made a decision, Mister Wing. You
          know, I believe that there's
          always an area of agreement that
          two people can reach.
           The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the 
          wereen, replacing Clamp's image.

          MR. WING
          Yes -- a man can always agree with
          others. It is more difficult to
          agree with oneself.

          FORSTER
           Does that mean you -- 
          He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that
          sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he
          answers Forster.

      

          MR. WING
          I'm sorry. Please tell Mister
          Clamp that the answer is no.

          FORSTER
          Keep the TV.
          As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the
          TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to
          change the TV CHANNEL.
          With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE
          from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie

          CAMERA:

          STALLONE
          To survive a war... you've got to
          become war.
          Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an
          arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a
          HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES.

          GIZMO (0.3.)
          Neat!

          But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and
          angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo.

          MR. WING
          Television again! Ai-vuh !. An -

          BODYGUARD
          I'm sorry that didn't work out,
          sir. I thought he'd like the TV.

          The advertising department of Daniel Clamp's empire occupies
          modern, "open-plan" offices -- endless beige partitions form
          tiny CUBICLES full of "ergonomic" furniture. Unseen speakers
          pipe in "WHITE NOISE" -- low-volume static to insulate

          hard to say which of then is more excited.
          But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo
          into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier
          a mess.

          Billy goes through a small anteroom and a second door, into the
          bathroom, where he leans against the door, catching his breath.
          He starts to lift the cover on the cage, then remembers to turn
          the LIGHTS down. He lifts the cover --
          A boy and his Mogwai! EMOTIONS flood over their faces --
          recognition, relief, shared secrets and memories. Billy props
          the cage on a sink, takes Gizmo out.

          BILLY
          Hey, guy...did you miss me?
          Gizmo does EYE MOVEMENTS -- shyly hedging, then admitting it.

          BILLY (CONT.)
          Yeah, me too. Let's put you up

           He stops at a sudden SOUND -- VOICES in the anteroom between the
          bathroom and the hail.

          .and doesn't see a big SPLASH F'o }wezï¿½ hit Billy's Chinatown
          picture. While Gizmo, thinking the danger is passed, steps out

          and the blob of water ROLLS DOWN the illustration board...
          .down the side of the desk...
          Gizmo looks up, but too late. From his POV, the blob of paint-
          tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. It HITS him --
          -- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in
          â¬.g., CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. The
          janitor leaves, and Gizmo SCREAMS, as -- THWIP! THWIP! -- two
          tiny FURBALLS shoot out of his body and land in the open DRAWER
          of a nearby filing cabinet.
          THWIP! The painful Mogwai replication continues, and a third
          furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.
          THWIP! The fourth and final offspring shoots from Gizmo's body,
          and -- as Gizmo watches in horror and pain -- BOUNCES crazily
          around the office area, a little Superball of fur.
          As Gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn
          Mogwai HANDS reach out of the filing cabinet drawer, gripping

          S
          the top edge from inside.

          Mogwais are revealed, standing in the drawer: GEORGE AND LENNY,
          an inseparable pair. Lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while
          George is small, with a criminal caginess -- he gets Lenny to do
          everything for him.
          Gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed
          start to ROCK back and forth -- but is distracted as the
          BOUNCING FURBALL hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets
          up onto a DESKTOP.
          To SOUND FX of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball
          rolls into a desk corner, and the third Mogwai unfolds --
          upside-down. This is DAFFY, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic
          Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate
          with the great Daffy Duck.
          In the first seconds following birth, Daffy goes daffy over the
          very fact of being alive. He sees his little hands and feet

          Mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach.

          Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT
          opening low on the wall behind him.

          As he talks, Clamp goes over to a bank of VIDEO MONITORS on his
          wall. Some of them display spy-camera views around the
          building, while others are tuned to Clamp Cable channels. One
          of these catches Clamp's eye: it's showing It's_a Wonderful Life
          in black and white.

           the Vice President of the United States and starting "Thank you #
           for your generous contribution..." #
          As the letter turns into paper spaghetti, the secretary leaves
          the shredder on, turns to her computer, and starts typing down

          CLAWS of an otherwise O.S. GREMLIN slip a spring-loaded
          MOUSETRAP under the top slice of bread.
          The claws withdraw from sight just as the secretary turns to
          pick up the sandwich again. She takes a bite -- and, though her

          The Gremlin responds by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot
          water from the nearby coffee station, and FLINGING the boiling
          water at Clamp --
          -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him.
          Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the
          empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the
          wall.
          The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his
          face, like a kid panicked by a moth --
          -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is
          caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do

           Gremlin down into the machine --

          GRANDPA FRED
          .tonight we've got a classic
          horror movie, from Grandpa Fred's
          special dungeon --
          Fred is interrupted by a MOAN -- not the normal weak moan on
          the tape, but a genuinely scary GREMLIN moan.
          He turns around, and sees a grinning GREMLIN emerge from behind
          the prop tombstone. As Fred heads back there, two other
          GREMLINS join the first one, and the three of them watch him
          intently.

           DIRECTOR (O.S. )
           Fred, what's the story with those
          -- things?

           GRANDPA FRED
          Uh.. .I don't...
          One of the Gremlins takes the reel of film from Fred, unreels
          a little from the loose end and holds it up. A second Gremlin
          looks at a frame -- mimes terrified shock, then CLUTCHES his
          chest and falls back onto the floor. The of e%.Gremlins LAUGH.

          Uh -- that ' s right, it ' s real '
          scary --
           The other two Gremlins put their f alongside Fred's and make
          scary snarls. They like it here

          DIRECTOR (O.S.)
          Boy, that's creepy. Okay,
          rolling...

          GRANDPA FRED
          Uh -- Grandpa Fred and his Friends
          have something horrible in store
          for you tonight...
           The Gremlins nod in gleeful agreement.

          Sunlight kills these things.
          That's why they're still in here.
          But when it's sundown -- or when
          they think it is -- they'll all get
          together in one place, so they can
          go out. They'll all be in the

          Billy squeezes Kate tighter, with Gizmo cuddled between them.
          The door to the building opens again -- and Billy's father, the
          inventor RAND PELTZER, comes in.

THE HEAVY METAL MOVIE 

- Final Draft -







								SCREENPLAY BY

								Len Blum






								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!

                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT 
                 Ah, what he does not know will not
                 hurt him.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...
                 Mothership calling starcruiser Alpha ...


ZEKE looks over at the screen and then shouts into it.


 ZEKE 
                 Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER ON SCREEN 
                 Mothership calling Starcruiser Alpha ...


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You gotta use the microphone.


 ZEKE 
                 Oh yeah.
                 (shouts into microphone)
                 Whaddyawant man?


 OFFICER 
                 Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to
                 tell you eight hundred times?  You
                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders
                 are to escort him to the Interplanetary
                 Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify
                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.
                 Here we go.


ZEKE jams the gearshift into hyper-drive.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed
of light.


 DISSOLVE TO

ZEKE and EDSEL'S round spacecraft looks like an apple
heading toward a freight train as it approaches the
enormous mother-ship.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL CONSOLE 
An ashtray full of roaches sits on the console.  ZEKE is
at the controls with a joint in his mouth.  He is swaying
back and forth, eyes glazed.  Beside him, EDSEL watches
the mothership getting closer.


 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 You okay to land this thing?


 ZEKE 
                 No problem, man.


 CUT TO 

MOTHERSHIP'S LANDING AREA 
Huge red arrows point the way through the ten-mile wide
landing area as the round spaceship glides in.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 I think you're goin' a little high,
                 man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 It's okay, man.  If there's one
                 thing I know, it's how to drive
                 when I'm stoned.  It's like, you
                 know your perspective's fucked,
                 so you just gotta let your hands
                 work the controls as if you're
                 straight.


The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,
skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow, good landing, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.) 
                 Thanks.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE SPACECRAFT - ENTRANCE HATCH 
ZEKE and EDSEL press a button to open the hatch doors.
As the door opens we see two metallic Regolian guards
waiting on the other side.  Between them stands a small,
shabbily-dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and
cauliflower ears.  This is HANOVER FISTE.


 REGOLIAN GUARD                     (to Zeke and Edsel)

                 This man is to be delivered to the,

                 Ah, hello.


 CUT TO 

CORRIDOR IN SPACESHIP 
ZEKE and EDSEL escort FISTE down the corridor.

                 Umm, you're gonna testify at
                 Sternn's trial?


FISTE nods.


 ZEKE 
                 They gotta give him at least, like,
                 life.


 FISTE 
                 Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable
                 man.
                 (camera pulls close to Fiste's face)
                 He will be freed.


 CUT TO 

SPACE - LATER 
As the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through
a fantastic space-scape of disembodied rock statues, and past
a magnificent graffiti-covered robot chained to an asteroid.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place
                 up, man.


 ZEKE (V.O.)

 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Yeah.

ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy-
paks.


 ROBOT 
                 ... but I don't understand.  We
                 laugh together.  We care for each
                 other.  We have highly proficient
                 sex.  Why can't we get married?


 GLORIA 
                 Look, we're different, okay?  Let's
                 leave it at that.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL ROOM 
The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through,
still talking.


 GLORIA 
                 ... but mixed marriages just don't
                 work.  What if you get tired of me
                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it
out and looks at it.


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 
ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully.
FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside
them.


 ZEKE 
                 There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang
                 a louie here.


 EDSEL                     (to Fiste)

                 Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are
                 you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn.


FISTE says nothing.  He just clutches the green ball and stares
into space.

ZEKE and EDSEL look at each other and shrug.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE SPACESHIP 
An enormous, brightly-lit, multi-level space station/courthouse
floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,

 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of
                 human goodness ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,
                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

								July 18, 1980


 
FADE UP ON 
A WHEATFIELD 
A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.


 CUT TO 

THE ATTIC WINDOW 
The curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer
down.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE VAN 
AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE HOUSE 
AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


 AUSTIN                     (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


 AUSTIN                     (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.


 CUT BACK TO 

AUSTIN 
Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.


 CUT TO 

A FOREST 
From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


 CUT TO 

A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET 
An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.


 CUT TO 

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM 
The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.


 CUT TO 

THE MOUNTAINS 
A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.


 CUT TO 

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS 
The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


 CUT TO 

THE BARBARIAN LEADER 
He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


 CUT TO 

THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 The city is burning!


 COUNCILMAN #4                     (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


 ELDER 
                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


 ELDER 
                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


 COUNCILMAN #1 
                 One?  What good is one?


 ELDER 
                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


 BOY 
                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


 COUNCILMAN #3 
                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


 ELDER 
                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


 COUNCILMAN #2 
                 But will this Defender answer?


 ELDER 
                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


 BOY 
                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


 ELDER                     (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


 ELDER                     (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


 CUT TO 

THE DOOR 
As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S FACE 
She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


 HUMANOID 
                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN GRIMALDI 
He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


 AUSTIN 
                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND BELOW 
The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


 CUT TO 

A GUN EMPLACEMENT 
Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


 CUT TO 

CLOSEUP OF A SHELL 
It is thrust into a breech.


 CUT TO 

THE B-17 FORMATION 
As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, "Pacific Pearl".


 CUT TO 

INT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 For Christ sake, hold her steady!


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop
                 'em and let's get outta here!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm
                 gonna hit something.
                 (he settles over the bomb sight)
                 Left two degrees ... steady ...
                 steady ...


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Hey kid, how ya doing back there?


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 
Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.


 TAILGUNNER 
                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay
                 ... I think.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up, we're almost there.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 C'mon Stepek, there's the
                 whole island of Rabaul down
                 there, you can't miss!


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Screw you ...


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT 
Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


 PILOT 
                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


 PILOT 
                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 We took one back here too.
                 C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER                     (hand on the release button)

                 Steady ... steady ... bombs away!
                 Let's get the hell outta here!


 CUT TO 

THE GROUND 
We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Yahoo!  Bullseye!


 CUT BACK TO 

THE PACIFIC PEARL 

 PILOT                     (exhilarated)

                 Nice shooting Stepek, how are the
                 rest of you guys?


 FLIGHT ENGINEER (V.O.) 
                 Flight Engineer okay.


 RADIO OPERATOR (V.O.) 
                 Radio okay.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Navigator check.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Belly okay.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Ah ... tail okay ...


There is abrupt silence.


 PILOT 
                 Bellson ... Lewis?


Still silence, no reply from either name.


 PILOT 
                 Kid, check the waist positions, see if
                 they're okay.


 CUT TO 

THE TAILGUNNER 

 TAILGUNNER 
                 Yeah ... will do, skipper.


TAILGUNNER crosses himself, then exits back into the body of
the machine.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT                     (wearily)

                 Let's go home.


We hear jumbled comments from all positions.  Everyone is
happy.


 CREW (V.O.) 
                 Cheers and whoops.


The mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner
reports back.


 TAILGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both
                 dead.


This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.


 PILOT 
                 Dammit!


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Well kid, now you got a real
                 bombing mission under your belt.


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 
He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a
bottle.


 CUT TO 

EXT. - THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
She rejoins the rest of the group.  The formation is not
quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.


 CUT TO 

LOW VIEW OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
Under the "Pacific Pearl's" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.


 CUT TO 

THE NOSE OF THE "PACIFIC PEARL" 
The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Sorry about Elkhorn, skip.
                 What happened?

 PILOT 
                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?


 PILOT 
                 He's dead.


 BOMBARDIER                     (sings drunkenly)

                 Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's
                 hole and the woodpecker said God
                 bless my soul; take it out, take it
                 out, take it out, remove it ...


 TAILGUNNER                     (bolder)

                 Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't
                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small
talk. It's the NAVIGATOR.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Something's wrong!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 
He is frantically tapping the compass.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 You got a problem, Holden?


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


 NAVIGATOR 
                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!


 CUT TO 

PILOT 
He looks at his compass.


 PILOT 
                 Mine says east.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the
                 squadron?


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


 CUT TO 

THE COCKPIT 
The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


 PILOT 
                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


 PILOT 
                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


 CUT TO 

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL 
All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


 BOMBARDIER (V.O.) 
                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...


 PILOT                     (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET 
The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's out there, just look at it ...


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


 BELLYGUNNER 
                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


 CUT TO 

PILOT'S POV 
He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


 PILOT 
                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PLANE 
The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


 PILOT 
                 Travis; go check the back.


 BELLYGUNNER (V.O.) 
                 Will do, skipper.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE HATCH 
TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


 PILOT                     (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


 PILOT 
                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


 CUT TO 

THE BELLYGUNNER 
He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


 CUT TO 

TRAVIS 
His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Holden, how far to base?


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


 PILOT 
                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE NAVIGATOR 

 NAVIGATOR 
                 It's all ocean down there, skip!


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 

 PILOT 
                 Mack, can you get us a radio fix?


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 

 RADIO OPERATOR 
                 Negative skip, too much interference.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.


 PILOT 
                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


 CUT TO 

THE BOMBARDIER 

 BOMBARDIER 
                 Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ...
                 ya wanna snort?


 PILOT (V.O.) 
                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


 BOMBARDIER 
                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...
                 (screams)


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will
                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.


 CUT BACK TO 

STEPEK 
He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


 CUT TO 

THE PLANE 
Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is scared.


 PILOT 
                 Holden, for God's sake get up
                 here on the double.


 NAVIGATOR (V.O.) 
                 What's the problem, skip?


 PILOT 
                 Just get up here!


The NAVIGATOR grimaces as he pushes past the dead co-pilot.


 NAVIGATOR 
                 What is it, skip?
                 (looking out windows)

 JESUS H. CHRIST! 

 PILOT 
                 Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.


He peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping
off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings.
The camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists
and then bursts open.  A dozen bat-like creatures swarm in.
The NAVIGATOR panics and reaches up, grabbing the flare gun
from its rack.  He screams as the creatures attack and shoots
right through the creatures, bathing the aircraft with a bright
ruby glow.


 NAVIGATOR                     (struggling)

                 Okay you little bastards ... shit ...
                 (screams)


 CUT TO 

THE RADIO OPERATOR 
The flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him.
Wreathed in flames, he falls back into the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
Creatures swarm all over the plane.  The ball turret falls
off.  A wheel suddenly lowers, then falls off.  A flap flutters
free and blows away.  Oil streams back into the slipstream and
sections of the skin of the plane come away, revealing the
skeleton framework of the fuselage.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit,
plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle
only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand.
Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels
at the attacking creatures with the other.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT 
It is now almost a flying skeleton.  For the first time, we
see that it is heading for an island.  A figure detaches itself
from the machine and plummets away.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute
opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips
off the glove and throws it and the creature away.


 PILOT 
                 (struggling)
                 Jesus H. Christ!


 CUT TO 

THE ISLAND 
The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces,
then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach,
where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming
from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly
to a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.


 CUT TO 

THE PILOT 
He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks
around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable
graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old
wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal
corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans
to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed
Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted
on its side are two names; "Amelia Earhart" and "Fred Noonan".

The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic
junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of
a pile of scrap.

Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan
metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The
metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to
lift it up.

WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally
coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls
back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,
who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his
needlenose pliers.


 AUSTIN 
                 Got it.


Satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,
he begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE
GIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?


 AUSTIN                     (concentrating)

                 Yes dear.  But Daddy's fixing
                 it.  (hums)


 LITTLE GIRL                     (watching)

                 How come it's always breaking?


 AUSTIN 
                 I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm.


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 When it's fixed, will you make more
                 funny pictures for me?


 AUSTIN 
                 Honey, why don't you go play with
                 your toys and let Daddy finish his
                 work, okay?  Mmmm ...


 LITTLE GIRL 
                 Okay.


The LITTLE GIRL wanders around to the other side of the machine,
as AUSTIN flips a switch.  Once again the glass sphere sparkles
and the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to
fine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;
the glass gates of Kraan.

As the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer
to the holograph screen.


 CUT TO 

THE GATES OF KRAAN 
The Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies
in over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful
city lies in ruins.

Gliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of
smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the
town's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard
on the reins, and heads her bird up.

The camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome
down to the Council Chambers below.

Corpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the
center of the room, a large pile of ancient books and
manuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA
dismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of
the marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,
a roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,
their tops glowing green.

TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices
that the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying
his stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion
just like the one her attacker wore on his chain.

Looking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly
in her hand.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING 
TAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys
the city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow
coming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,
pulls up beside the window, and climbs in.


 CUT TO 

GIRL'S BEDROOM 
Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.
The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From
within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.

TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow
coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,
sword drawn.

Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and
shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the
ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously
ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through
snake-like fangs.


 WITCH 
                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!
                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon
                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies
                 the end of heaven - the beginning of
                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death
                 in your hands.  For death is upon
                 you.  And as you perish ... so dies
                 your race!


The witch's eyes go green.


 WITCH                     (screaming)

                 Take it !!


She hurls tha ball at TAARNA, who dodges it.  The ball sails
past her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps
at the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.

The WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes
stay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through
the room.

TAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As
she flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,
rising into the clouds and disappearing.


 CUT TO 

SPACE 
The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears
in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting
closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no
determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green
meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the
hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of
an automobile suspended in the open hatch.

Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from
the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now
that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.

With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and
as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its
free-fall to Earth.

As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays
with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one
way, then the other.

Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car
radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles
on one.

With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to
Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the
atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts
burning up.

As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his
approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking
Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the
repeated impact.

The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into
high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt
to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then
he pops his drag chute to help slow down.

TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the
chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.


 CUT TO 

EXT. THE PENTAGON - AERIAL SHOT 
From high above the building we see a crowd of reporters
and T.V. newsmen waiting on the front steps.

The '59 Corvette pulls up at the curb below, and seeing
it, the reporters all start to run over.

The camera zooms down and into the car.  Inside, the driver
reaches over, unplugs a rubber hose, and loosens the two
large hex-nuts which connect him to the car.  As he gets out,
the reporters come running up.


 FEMALE REPORTER                     (to driver)

                 Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were
                 sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do
                 you still say this has nothing to do
                 with the green radiation from space.


The driver walks on without speaking.


 T.V. NEWSMAN                     (walking alongside)

                 Doctor, is it true that the President
                 himself pulled you off the Jupiter Six
                 Project so that you could investigate
                 those mutations? Doctor, answer me that.


He ignores the question, and walks past the guard into the
Pentagon.


 CUT TO 

INT. PENTAGON - MEETING ROOM 
Around a large table sit the Joint Chiefs of Staff, members of
the Cabinet, and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt.
An argument is in progress as the expressionless DOCTOR ANRAK
enters.  The camera follows him as he sits down next to one
of the Generals.


 FAT POLITICIAN 
                 ... well what I wanna know is,
                 what's the Army doing about this?
                 Hell!  My constiuents are turning
                 green!  They're growing arms on
                 their backs.  There's something or
                 someone up there in space and the
                 voters have a right to know about it!


 GENERAL 
                 Senator, we have no proof that these
                 mutations are the result of interference
                 from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak
                 has just come in, so let's hear what he
                 has to say ... Doctor?


The room goes silent as the DOCTOR stands up.


 DOCTOR 
                 First of all, there is no cause for
                 alarm.  As for the theories of interference
                 by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that
                 we on Earth are the only intelligent,
                 technically advanced civilization present
                 in the universe.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
An enormous round spaceship the size of Pittsburg hovers
overhead.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 

 DOCTOR 
                 ... and whatever is causing these
                 mutations is not from outer space.
                 it's more likely just an isolated
                 biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ...
                 ph ... ph ...


Suddenly the DOCTOR'S head starts to jerk from side to side.
Everyone looks on, not knowing how to react.  As the DOCTOR
begins to move in short bursts, like a broken robot, he
fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE PENTAGON 
From the bottom of the huge spacecraft, a metal tube emerges and
starts to drill through the roof of the Pentagon.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE MEETING ROOM 
The DOCTOR starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty
secretary.


 DOCTOR 
                 Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...


Suddenly he lunges at her, sliding across the table.


As the DOCTOR struggles with the terrified girl, the camera
pans up to the ceiling, where the metal tube from the spaceship
drills through.  Descending upon them, it sucks them up instantly.


 DOCTOR 
                 Aaarrgghh!


 SECRETARY 
                 Eeeeeek!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - CONTROL ROOM 
A metallic robot holding a clipboard, is standing in front of
a large glass receiving jar, as DOCTOR ANRAK comes through
the tube and lands in the jar.  As soon as the DOCTOR'S feet
hit the bottom of the jar, the DOCTOR breaks into a lot of
small metallic parts.


 ROBOT                     (Mechanical voice)

                 Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed
                 to fix this guy?  He's fucked.


ZEKE and EDSEL, two alien space-pilots, are standing nearby,
at the control console.  They look like big furry orange heads
on stilts, with arms coming out of the sider.


 ZEKE                     (to Edsel)

                 I guess we turned it up a
                 little too high.


 EDSEL                     (to Robot)

                 Sorry, man.


 ROBOT 
                 You're sorry?  What about me?
                 I've gotta put this asshole
                 back together.


Suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands
in the jar.  She's a little mussed up, but okay.


 GLORIA 
                 (gasp)  Where am I?


 ROBOT                     (staring)

                 Hey, who's the chick?


 GLORIA 
                 Well look at my clothes!
                 Who's gonna pay for the dry
                 cleaning?  And where am I?
                 I demand that you return me
                 to my office immediately.


 ROBOT 
                 Too late - molecular instability
                 zone around spacecraft. You cannot
                 leave.


 GLORIA                     (to Zeke)

                 What?!  Is he kidding?


 ZEKE 
                 Uh ...


He looks at the ROBOT, who winks at him.


 ZEKE 
                 ... oh yeah.  Instability zone.
                 You're stuck here.


ZEKE and EDSEL try to keep straight faces.


 GLORIA                     (stunned)

                 But I have to be at my parents
                 for dinner tonight.  And my
                 gynecologist appointment is on
                 Wednesday.


 ROBOT 
                 Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like
                 a drink?
                 (leading her away)
                 You'll feel better after a glass of
                 fresh blo-aak.


They disappear down a corridor.


 GLORIA (V.O.) 
                 Do you have any diet soda?


 CUT TO 

CONTROL CONSOLE 

 EDSEL                     (to Zeke)

                 Ah, typical robot.  The first
                 Earth-chick we see in ten years,
                 and he's gotta make a play for her.


EDSEL jams the gearshift into 'D' for Drive, and the ship
lifts away from Earth.


 ZEKE 
                 Hey, do we have any of that
                 Plutonian Nyborg left?


 EDSEL 
                 Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's
                 in the transmitter compartment.


 ZEKE 
                 Uh, thanks man.


ZEKE opens a hatch and pulls out a double-spouted plastic
bag on wheels the size of a steamer-trunk.  It is full of
white powder.


He pours two fifteen-foot lines of powder onto the floor.
Then, he pauses.


 ZEKE                     (surveying the lines)

                 Oh great.  Think this is enough?


 EDSEL                     (thinking)

                 Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.


 ZEKE 
                 Good thinking, man.


As he resumes pouring, ZEKE begins singing to himself in an
alien tongue.  When the lines are poured, they both stand at
the start of the trail of white powder, and part their hair
to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads.


 ZEKE & EDSEL 
                 Nose dive!


They both start to criss-cross the room, inhaling the white
powder like vaccuum cleaners.  As they happily snort the
Nyborg, the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar, and
moves down through the broken pieces of DOCTOR ANRAK.  Reaching
his lifeless face, the camera moves around to the back of the
head.  Through the shattered metal we can see a green ball,
glowing inside ANRAK'S skullpiece.


 DISSOLVE TO 

SPACE - ZEKE AND EDSEL'S P.O.V. 
As the round spaceship moves through space, a group of
asteroids approach and whip past.  Up ahead, a red sun
turns white and goes super-nova.


 EDSEL (V.O.) 
                 Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE SPACECRAFT - ROBOT'S BEDROOM 
GLORIA PEARLMAN and the ROBOT are lying in bed, naked.
They have just finished making love.  She is smoking a cigarette.


 GLORIA                     (glazed)

                 That was incredible.  I've never felt
                 anything like it.


 ROBOT 
                 Oh great.  I have been programmed to
                 be fully proficient in sexual activities.
                 Do you want to go steady?


 GLORIA 
                 Gee, I don't know.  I already have
                 a boyfriend.


 ROBOT

                 hurt him.


 CUT TO

ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed
out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell
rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's
face appears on it.


 OFFICER ON SCREEN

                 don't call me "man"!  You call me
                 "Com-Op Officer Blix". Now is that
                 perfectly clear?


 ZEKE                     (into mike)

                 Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?


 OFFICER                     (disgruntled)

                 You are to return immediately to
                 the Mother Ship and pick up a
                 humanoid civilian.  Your orders

                 at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make
                 it snappy!


The screen goes blank.


 EDSEL 
                 Wow!  They finally got Sternn.


 ZEKE 
                 It's about time.  Hang on, man.

The round ship rams directly into a wall, and crashes down,

FISTE nods.


 ZEKE

                 and run off with a vibrator or
                 something?


As they move through the room, and out the other side, they
pass FISTE, who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar,
hands folded.  Looking around, FISTE notices a green glow
coming from the bottom of the jar.  He gets up, quietly opens
the jar, and pokes through the scrap robot parts.

Finding the small green ball in ANRAK'S head, he pulls it

floats into view, completely filling the screen.  ZEKE and
EDSEL'S round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame,
approaching the mammoth structure.


 CUT TO 

SPACE-STATION LANDING DOCK 
The ship locks into the dock, and the exit hatch opens.
GLORIA and the ROBOT come through first, ahead of ZEKE, EDSEL,
and FISTE.


 GLORIA 
                 ... alright, alright.  I'll marry
                 you - but on one condition ... I
                 want a Jewish wedding.


 ROBOT 
                 A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is
                 space.  95% of the population are
                 robots.


 GLORIA 
                 Well, find me a robot-rabbi!


 ROBOT 
                 Okay, okay!


 EDSEL 
                 I give them six months, man.


 ZEKE 
                 He doesn't even look Jewish!


GLORIA and the ROBOT disappear around a corner as ZEKE and EDSEL
escort FISTE through the hatch.  FISTE is carrying the small
green ball.

As they lead FISTE away, the camera pulls back, out through
a space-port, and moves along the outside of the slowly
rotating space-station.  At the top, the camera zooms down
through a massive glass-domed ceiling and into a huge
inter-galactic courtroom.

Voices echo below us.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?


 STERNN 
                 I am.


As we move down, we see square-jawed CAPTAIN STERNN, his
shifty-eyed lawyer, and the cold Prosecutor all standing
before the Judge.

STERNN is smirking confidently as the Prosecutor reads from
a long page of charges.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 Lincoln Sternn - you stand here
                 accused of twelve counts of murder
                 in the first degree  ... fourteen
                 counts of armed theft of Federation
                 property ...


 CUT TO 

THE GALLERY 
The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with
hateful, accusing eyes.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... twenty-two counts of piracy
                 in high space ... eighteen counts of
                 fraud ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN'S LAWYER 
Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN.


 PROSECUTOR (V.O.) 
                 ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and
                 one moving violation.  How do you plead?


 CUT TO 

CAPTAIN STERNN 
Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious.


 STERNN 
                 Not guilty!


 LAWYER                     (whispers to Sternn)

                 Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?


 STERNN                     (whispers to lawyer)

                 It's okay, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


 JUDGE                     (to Prosecutor)

                 Call the first witness!


STERNN and his lawyer move to their seats.


 LAWYER                     (to Sternn)

                 But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold!
                 Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish
                 bowl.


 CUT TO 

THE COURTROOM DOORS 
ZEKE and EDSEL enter with FISTE, and push their way to the
front.


 PROSECUTOR 
                 The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.


 GUARD #1 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #2 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #3 
                 Calling Hanover Fiste!


 GUARD #4 
                 Hanover Fiste!


ZEKE and EDSEL sit down, while HANOVER FISTE, small and
shabby, walks up to the witness stand, nervously clutching
the small green ball in his hand.  As he passes, STERNN and
his lawyer continue to argue.


 LAWYER                     (pleading)

                 Lissen Sternn ... change the plea
                 to guilty.  Throw yerself on the
                 mercy of the court.


 STERNN 
                 I told you, Charlie.  I got an
                 angle.


HANOVER FISTE is sworn in, as Sternn's lawyer begs.


 LAWYER 
                 But the most we can hope for is to
                 get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave
                 don't get violated!  Plead guilty!


 STERNN 
                 Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle.


 LAWYER 
                 What angle?


 STERNN                     (pointing to Fiste)

                 Him!


 CUT TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 State your name for the record.


 FISTE                     (fidgeting nervously with
                     the green ball)

                 I am Hanover Fiste.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 

 STERNN                     (winking to lawyer)

                 I promised him thirty-five thousand
                 zuleks to testify on my behalf.


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 PROSECUTOR 
                 You know the defendant,
                 (pointing)
                 Captain Sternn?


 FISTE 
                 Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And
                 never did there live a kinder, more
                 generous man.  He is an overflowing
                 cup, filled with the very cream of
                 human goodness ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 

 STERNN                     (to lawyer)

                 See?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE 
                 ... in all the time I've known him,
                 he's never done anything immoral ...
                 (thinking)
                 unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's
                 Prostitute ring ...


 CUT TO 

STERNN AND HIS LAWYER 
They look at each other, shocked.


 STERNN & LAWYER 
                 Huh?!?


 CUT BACK TO 

WITNESS STAND 

 FISTE                     (speaking gently)

                 ... and he's ah, never done anything
                 illegal ...
                 (turning sharply)
                 ... unless you count all the times
                 he sold dope disguised as a nun!!
                 (reverting to meekness)
                 He's always been a good, law-abiding
                 citizen ...
                 (shouting at himself)
                 Awww, gimme a break!!
                 (gentle again)
                 ... of the Federation, and, and ...
                 (going schizo)
                 Shut Up!  Shut Up!  Shut Up!
                 (gentle, but starting to sweat)
                 ... a community-concious individual, ah, ah ...
                 (rising in crazed anger)
 STERNN!!!                  (pointing as he screams)
                 He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin',
                 back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!


STERNN and his lawyer look on, horrified, as FISTE'S body
starts to grow.


 FISTE 
                 Hangin's too good for him!!


New muscles tear through FISTE'S shabby clothes.


 FISTE 
                 Burnin's too good for him!!


Growing larger, he starts foaming at the mouth.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 He should be torn into little bitsy
                 pieces and buried alive!!!


FISTE rams his hands down onto the Witness Stand, shattering
it completely.


 STERNN 
                 Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll kill him!


He hurls the Prosecutor aside, and moves towards STERNN with
thundering footsteps.


 FISTE 
 KII - ILLL!!! 

Still growing, he rips apart the Judge's bench as he passes
it.  Finally  he stands towering in rage over the terrified
STERNN. 

 STERNN                     (to Fiste)

                 H-h-hey, Hanover ...
                 n-now take it easy, Hanover,
                 I'm sure we can talk this ov ...


Instinctively, STERNN leaps back as FISTE'S giant hands come
smashing down in the spot where STERNN stood.  The gallery
scatters screaming as STERNN runs for the door.  Slavering,
FISTE thunders after him.  STERNN runs through the exit,
bolting the door behind him.  FISTE follows, tearing the
door apart, and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in
the process.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian
cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the
rampaging FISTE.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 Halt, clik, in the name of the
                 Federation, clik.  Where is your
                 corridor pass?
                 (to other Regolians)
                 Unco-operative humanoid, clik,
                 blast him.


They open fire, but FISTE is unstoppable.  Still growing,
he grabs the Regolians's weapons, crunches them up and eats
them.


 REGOLIAN #1 
                 You are now in violation of Code
                 103-N-17, clik, paragraph A-64 ...
                 unauthorized consumption of Federation
                 property.  Please come quietly, clik,
                 ... thenk yew.


With a single clap of his enormous hands, FISTE crushes the
Regolian's metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness
of a dime.


 CUT TO 

STERNN 
He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler
room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel,
STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest.


 STERNN 
                 Oh, this looks good.


 FISTE 
                 (growls)


 STERNN 
                 Oh, duck under here ...


 FISTE 
                 I'll get you!!


 STERNN 
                 I think I'll turn here!
                 (runs, gasping)
                 Come on feet, don't fail me now!


 FISTE 
                 Sternn!!!


 STERNN 
                 Uh oh ...
                 (runs)
                 Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!


 FISTE 
 STERNN!! 

 STERNN 
                 Okay, Hanover, you've had this
                 coming!


Taking a deep breath, STERNN reaches into his pocket, pulls
out a wad of bills, and counts them out as he hands them to
FISTE. 

 STERNN 
                 Let's see, thirty-three, thirty-
                 four, thirty-five thousand zuleks.
                 Thanks Hanover.


 FISTE                     (taking money)

                 S'nothin, boss.


Counting his money, FISTE starts shrinking back to his
normal size.


 STERNN 
                 And Hanover ...


 FISTE 
                 Yes?


 STERNN 
                 Goodbye.


STERNN pulls a lever, which opens up the floor below FISTE,
who screams, falling out into space.  As FISTE slides out,
STERNN grabs the money from FISTE'S hand and smiles.


 CUT TO 

THE OUTLANDS 
All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and
barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which
gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!

A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down
around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the
burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his
clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the
distance.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA 
She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and
cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.
Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting
floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into
the rock.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY 
Landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA
dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,
and picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil
over herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.
Then she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle
even brighter.

Finishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone
wall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal
a gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.

Inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,
so bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,
as she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE
DEFENDER comes into her head.


 TAARAK (V.O.) 
                 To defend - this is the Pact.
                 but when life loses its value,
                 and it taken for nought, then
                 the Pact is ... to avenge!!


Through a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously
fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally
we pull back to see her fully.

Standing before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks
magnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls
out a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,
almost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing
cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As
the burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she
sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.
Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run
around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.

Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures
tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the
creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the
leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the
Elder's fingers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE THE BARROOM 
Barbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as
various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the
bar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.

Three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and
rowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his
head, laugh and kick him.


 CUT TO 

THE BARROOM DOOR 
TAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass
doors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.  She sits
down at the bar.

The three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and
walk over to the bar, crowding close around TAARNA.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 Hey, look.  A new one.
                 (to Taarna)
                 Where you from, baby?


TAARNA ignores him.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Doesn't talk much, does she ?


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 She doesn't have to talk for what
                 I want to do with her.


 CUT TO 

TAARNA'S HAND 
It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.

 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARBARIANS 

 BARBARIAN #3 
                 (running his hand across her breastplate)
                 C'mon baby, let's see what's under there.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 (starting to undo her breastplate)
                 Yeah, let's have a look.


Taarna slowly stands up, pushing their hands away, and takes
a step back.


 BARBARIAN #2 
                 Heey, she's tough.


 BARBARIAN #3 
                 Maybe she wants to fight?


They all laugh.


 BARBARIAN #1 
                 ... or maybe she wants to take
                 us all on?


Still laughing, they move towards her.

In a blinding flash, TAARNA draws her golden sword, and wielding
it like a Samurai master, slices off all three of their heads.
In an instant, the sword is back in its sheath.

The barbarian's heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground.
The music stops, and everyone in the bar stares at TAARNA.

Stepping over the bodies, TAARNA walks up to the bartender,
pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains, and
shows it to him.  The bartender looks at it carefully, then
points out the window.


 BARTENDER 
                 Beyond the oasis.


TAARNA nods and leaves.


 CUT BACK TO 

THE BARTENDER 
His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and
closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into
the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph.


 CUT TO 

AUSTIN 
AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs,
trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens.


 AUSTIN                     (to himself)

                 Hmmm ... must be jammed.


Frustrated, AUSTIN picks up a flashlight, opens up a compartment
underneath the control knobs, and takes a look inside.  While
AUSTIN fiddles inside the machine, we see two hands appear on
the holograph screen and pick up the green ball.  AUSTIN looks
over to the holograph and notices.


 AUSTIN 
                 Where'd it go?


 CUT TO 

THE HANDS

As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back
to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses,
carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It all started when I found the green
                 meteorite.  I read in Farraday's "Life
                 of the Planets" that smaller ones like
                 this are supposed to burn up when they
                 enter the atmosphere, but for some reason
                 this one didn't ...


DAN carries the ball into a typical small-town house.


 DISSOLVE TO 

T.V. ANTENNA ON ROOF - STORMY NIGHT

As the narration continues, we follow two red wires down
from the T.V. antenna, along the roof, and into DAN'S attic
window.  The wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked
up to some electronic parts on DAN'S desk.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... so I brought it up to my room,
                 stuck it in my rock collection and
                 forgot about it.  I was experimenting
                 with natural electricity ...


The camera pans around the room to show various displays of
DAN'S scientific tinkering - blue-ribbon science projects,
transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal
organs, and many books.

In the corner, the green ball sits in DAN'S rock collection.

At his desk, DAN impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages
of an old scientific journal.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 ... and with the storm warnings up,
                 I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the
                 jackpot.  All I needed was a little
                 juice.


He looks out the window at the gathering storm.


 CUT TO 

THE STORM 
Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the
television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic.


 CUT TO 

DAN'S ATTIC ROOM 
The lightning flashes into DAN'S apparatus, lighting it up
brightly.


 DAN 
                 It works!


Suddenly, an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water
and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf.
Caught in the middle, DAN begins to glow green.


 DAN                     (looking at his
                     green arms)

                 Oh Jesus!


The electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another
universe and DAN de-materializes.


 CUT TO 

THE TRANSFORMATION 
We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images
zoom past.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I felt like I was nothing
                 - just atoms floating in the
                 darkness ...


Then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner
of the screen. The glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly
around the screen.  Now, we can make out some of the images
whipping past - a half-formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling
pyramid, a green ball.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Then, a body started to re-form
                 around me.  Only it wasn't my
                 body - this one had muscles.


Sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving
light.  They join up with each other to form a powerfully built
human figure.

Finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything
gets brighter and clearer.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 It was a great body, but I
                 wasn't too crazy about the
                 face.


The powerful figure, DEN, turns slowly as he floats and begins
to look at his hands and arms.  Moving his mouth, he speaks in
a new voice - deep and powerful.


 DEN                     (feeling head)

                 Hmmm ... no hair.


Suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours
as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second
shimmering gateway.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
DEN, strong, masculine and hairless, materializes cradled in
the hand of a huge stone idol.  He is naked and unconscious
Above him, the glowing green ball is held in the idol's other
hand.

The camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the
deck, stop a huge, truncated pyramid.  The deck forms a walkway
around a swirling pool of green water.

Kneeling all around the seething pool, are lizard-men, wearing
priest's robes.  Two of them stand beside a glass coffin.  Inside
the coffin, lies a naked girl, bound and gagged.


 PRIESTS                     (chanting softly)

                 Uluhtec, Ulutec ...


Directly in fron of the idol, a regal-looking QUEEN, wearing
a revealing velvet cloak, is praying to the raging water.


 QUEEN 
                 By the powers of the glowing
                 Loc-Nar placed in your idol's
                 hand, I demand you come forth,
                 Uluhtec!


The waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and
a low rumble is heard far below.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S HANDS

The green ball, (Loc-Nar), glows brightly as DEN opens his eyes,
looks down and notices his enormous genitals.


 DEN 
                 Hmmm ... big!


Seeing an animal-skin hanging from the idol, he rips off a
piece and wraps it around himself.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was no way I was gonna
                 walk around this place with
                 my dork hangin' out!


Suitably covered, he surveys the ritual taking place below him.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This looked like something
                 right out of the Ten Commandments.


 CUT TO 

EDGE OF RAGING POOL

The QUEEN is kneeling before the seething water.


 QUEEN 
                 Grant me your strength in return
                 for a living mortal sacrifice!  It
                 has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec!
                 I demand it!


Two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass
case and hold her out over the swirling water.  The QUEEN
nods and the two priests drop her in.


 CUT TO 

THE IDOL'S WATER 
Seeing the girl struggle in the water, DEN'S eyes grow wide.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 What'd they do that for?


He stands and dives into the raging pool, swimming powerfully
towards the drowning girl.

 CUT TO 
UNDER WATER 
Reaching her, DEN grabs the girl's  bound ankles, hooks them
over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the
underwater wall.  Inside a stone tunnel, they are swept along
by the current.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I
                 kept thinking I was going to run
                 out of air, but my new body worked
                 great.  I just hoped her body was
                 working as good as mine.


 CUT TO 

EXT. FIELD OF LILIES - DAY 
DEN and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of
a beautiful field of lilies.  He pulls her out of the water,
unconscious.  As he unties her, she begins to stir.


 GIRL 
                 Thank you.


She takes DEN'S hand and lies back in the flower, her
beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 She had the most beautiful eyes.
                 I wanted to make some conversation
                 but I found my new self asking the
                 same old stupid questions.


 DEN 
                 Are you from around here?


 GIRL 
                 Well, you may not believe this, but
                 I'm from another world - from a place
                 called Earth.


 DEN 
                 Earth?  I too am from Earth.
                 How did you get here?


 GIRL 
                 My name is Katherine Wells, and
                 I'm from the British colony of
                 Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff-
                 erence here, but there it was
                 the summer of 1892.  It was
                 evening - I'd gone for a walk on
                 the cliffs when suddenly a sphere
                 fell from the sky.  Following its
                 glow, I came to a shining gate made
                 out of light.  Unable to resist, I
                 stepped through it and awoke in
                 this world.  There I was thin and
                 weakly, fit only to stay indoors.
                 (she stands up)
                 But here, somehow I am stronger,
                 more alive,
                 (she stretches seductively)
                 ... more fully a woman.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 You're not kidding.


 DEN                     (standing)

                 I, too seem better equipped on
                 this world.
                 (he holds out his arm)
                 My arms are more powerful.
                 (strecthes his fingers)
                 Even my fingers seem to hold
                 great strength.


KATHERINE walks up close to DEN, takes his hand and touches
the fingers to her breast.


 KATHERINE 
                 You saved my life.  I have no
                 reward to give you, but if any
                 part of me pleases your senses
                 - I would give it willingly.


She circles her nipple with his baby finger.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  This was great!  There was
                 no way I'd get a chick like this
                 back on Earth.  I mean, look at
                 her!!


Taking KATHERINE in his arms, DEN lays her down on a bed of
flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 There was only one problem ...


A spiked boot appears in the frame.  The camera pans up to
show a large, ugly hairy beast-man standing over DEN and
KATHERINE. 
The camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple,
completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.


 DAN (V.O. 
                 I don't know who these jerks
                 were, but they sure picked a
                 bad time to show up ...


The ugly beast-men grab DEN and KATHERINE as we;


 DISSOLVE TO 

ARD'S THRONE ROOM 
The beast-Captain keeps his machine gun trained on DEN as
the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They split us up and took me to
                 this weird castle-type place.
                 I wanted to find out where they'd
                 taken Katherine, but none of these
                 guys seemed to speak English.


In the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal
with a throne carved into it.  On the throne sits ARD, a
child-like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.


 ARD 
                 They tell me you are Den of Earth,
                 the one who dared to steal the
                 female sacrifice from the Queen.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy was a shrimp so I figured
                 I'd play it tough.


 DEN 
                 Where is the girl?


 ARD 
                 I am Ard - supreme leader of
                 the revolution and the next
                 ruler of the world.


 DEN                     (tougher)

                 The girl!!


 ARD 
                 Well, aren't we fierce?
                 If you are truly as tough as
                 you seem, then you will serve
                 me well.  But first, a test.
                 Guards!  Castrate him!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


Two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved
short-swords.  DEN turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust
and delivers a bone-shattering elbow to the beast's head,
crushing his skull.

Spinning with his own momentum, DEN throws a rock-hard fist
into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib-cage and
sending him flying across the room.

Without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast-
Captain and lifts him into the air by his machine-gun.  The
Captain hangs on as DEN twists the gun, butts it into the
creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the
Captain's jaw.

The creature crumples, leaving DEN with the gun.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy!  I was pretty good at this
                 stuff.


 ARD 
                 Excellent.  You are worthy to
                 serve me.


 DEN                     (aiming machine-gun at him)

                 Give me the girl or die.


 ARD                     (taking it lightly)

                 Well, if I have a choice, I'll
                 take death.


 DEN 
                 So be it.


DEN fires, spraying a row of bullets across ARD'S body.  The
bullets blast big yellow holes in ARD'S chest, but there is
no blood.  ARD looks up and laughs.


 ARD 
                 Ha ha ha!  You'll have to
                 do better than that.


As DEN looks on, ARD'S wounds miraculously close up and heal
themselves over.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I could see why they made this
                 guy their leader.


 ARD                     (standing up)

                 ... but if you're really interested
                 in the girl; I've had her encased in
                 glass.


ARD pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal
KATHERINE, unconscious, sealed inside.


 DEN 
                 She's dead.


 ARD 
                 Actually no.  She's sleeping,
                 but only I can awaken her.


 DEN 
                 What do you want of me?


 ARD 
                 I want you to steal the sacred
                 Loc-Nar.


 DEN 
                 What is this Loc-Nar?


 ARD 
                 The Queen's glowing sphere, you
                 fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec
                 can only be performed by the
                 possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.
                 (calling out)
                 Norl!


NORL, a huge gorilla-man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.


 ARD                     (to Den)

                 This is Norl, my bravest warrior.
                 You will go with him to the Queen's
                 castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then
                 I will give you the girl.


 DEN 
                 And if I refuse?


 ARD 
                 If you refuse, you die, she dies,
                 everybody dies.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Sounded reasonable to me.


DEN looks down at KATHERINE'S motionless body.


 DISSOLVE TO 

RIVER BANKS NEAR THE QUEEN'S CASTLE 
In the moonlight, DEN and NORL lead a squad of beast-warriors,
armed with automatic weapons, along the river towards the Queen's
castle.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We
                 must go underground.


NORL lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 This guy Norl seemed to know what
                 he was doing.  And, for a gorilla,
                 his English wasn't half bad.


DEN and the warriors enter the underground passage.


 CUT TO 

UNDERGROUND TUNNEL 
The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They
pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other
side.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 We're underneath the castle moat.


DEN nods.  An ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead.
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own
languages.


 DEN                     (to Norl)

                 What are they saying?


 NORL 
                 They talk of the savage beast who
                 prowls these catacombs with a fierce
                 hunger and sharp teeth ...
                 (gestures)
                 six inches long.


A dog-faced warrior shakes his head and says something to NORL.


 NORL 
                 Sorry ...
                 (indicating)
                 ... sixteen inches long.


Suddenly, a savage beast appears and chomps his long, razor-sharp
teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line.  DEN, NORL,
and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as, behind
them, the monster pulls his victim apart.


 CUT TO 

DOORWAY IN CATACOMBS 
DEN, NORL, and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the
rock wall.


 NORL                     (to Den)

                 Now we separate.  You and Korg
                 take this door into the Queen's
                 quarters.    The rest of us will
                 move through the walls and enter
                 her chamber from the other side.
                 Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will
                 return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den.


DEN nods, puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as
NORL moves off.


 CUT TO 

DARK ROOM 
DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the
glow of the green ball casts a pale light.


 KORG                     (whispers and points)

                 Loc-Nar.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  It was just like the
                 ball I dug up in my back yard.


They tip-toe towards it.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I
                 had this real funny feeling.  All
                 by themselves, my hands reached
                 forward to touch it.  But the
                 Loc-Nar moved out of the way.
                 Instead, my hands felt something
                 else - warm flesh.  Then the lights
                 came on.


In the brightly lit room, DEN is standing before the beautiful
semi-clad QUEEN, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands.
Looking around, he sees that he and KONG are surrounded by a
brigade of the Queen's ugly guards, swords raised.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Talk about embarassing!


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Kill them.


The Queen's guards attack with battle-axes, clubs and swords.
As DEN knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's
face, four of the guards surround KORG and club his brains out.

But DEN, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall
and heaves a third out the window.  As the QUEEN watches with
glee, more guards rush into the room and DEN is finally over-
powered and held down.  The Captain of the guards places a long
knife against Den's throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Can I slit his throat, your
                 Majesty?


The QUEEN, eyeing Den's magnificent body, sighs.


 QUEEN 
                 Yes, slit his throat.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Thank you, your Majesty.


As the Captain presses his knife against Den's flesh, the
QUEEN suddenly raises her hand.


 QUEEN                     (smiling)

                 Stop!  I have, ah, something better
                 in mind.


She takes Den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as
the guards grumble to one another.


 GUARD #1 
                 Jeez, not again.


 GUARD #2 
                 This always happens.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Look, she's the Queen.  She
                 can do whatever she wants.


 GUARD #2 
                 Yeah, sure.


 GUARD #1 
                 Sure.


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN'S BOUDOIR 
The QUEEN stands before DEN, hands on her hips and a funny look
in her eye.


 QUEEN 
                 If you please me, I may let
                 you live.


She smiles, and approaches DEN.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Uh oh.


 DEN 
                 What must I do?


 QUEEN 
                 Satisfy my appetites.


The QUEEN lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer.
She is naked underneath.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin'
                 and now, twice in one day.  What
                 a place!


 QUEEN 
                 Come with me.


 DEN 
                 Mmmm.


She steps forward and takes his hand, leading him towards the
bed.


 DISSOLVE TO 

THE QUEEN'S BED 
DEN and the QUEEN are lying undressed on the enormous bed.
The QUEEN has a very contented look on her face.  DEN looks
exhausted.  As the Neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber
window, the QUEEN slowly runs her hand over DEN'S bulging
muscles.


 QUEEN                     (softly)

                 The rising moon climaxes our
                 love, Den.  Is is a sign, a
                 new beginning.


 DEN 
                 Yes, a sign.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I had no idea what she was
                 talking about.


 QUEEN                     (stroking him)

                 Neverwhere is a troubled land,
                 but together we could calm it.
                 We could rule side by side.
                 Your strength has brought great
                 peace to my restless body.  It
                 could bring great peace to all
                 the troubled people of this land.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 I knew I was good, but I didn't know
                 I was that good.


Suddenly the Captain and his guards burst through the door.


 CAPTAIN 
                 Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing
                 - stolen!


The QUEEN jumps to her feet in a rage and points to DEN.


 QUEEN                     (screaming)

                 Fiend!  You make love to me while
                 your accomplices steal the magic
                 sphere!  Guards!  Take him!


The guards grab DEN as the  QUEEN snatches one of their big
spiked clubs.


 QUEEN                     (to guards)

                 Hold him still!  I will kill
                 him myself!


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 Boy, was she pissed off!


Heaving the guards aside, DEN breaks free and jumps out the
chamber window.


 CUT TO 

THE CASTLE WALL 
DEN falls down, down into the swirling waters of the castle
moat.


 (CUT TO) 

THE QUEEN 
She is livid.


 QUEEN 
                 Prepare the flying lizards.
                 I want his head!


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE 
Pulling himself out of the moat, DEN knocks a guard off his
leopard/horse and rides off.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool.  Beside
him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains.  Through the
chains we see KATHERINE trapped inside - fully conscious and
terrified.  Ard's bestial warriors stand all around carrying
torches and spears.

Above them, the Loc-Nar sits glowing in the stone idol's hand.


 ARD 
                 By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
                 placed in your idol's hands, I
                 command you - come forth Uluhtec!


The green water in the pool immediately begins to churn
violently and leap into the air.  A bolt of lightning
crackles in the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
DEN is racing across the barren desert on his leopard/horse.
Visible in the distance is the outline of the huge, truncated
pyramid where he first saved KATHERINE.

As he rides, he sees the green glow of the Loc-Nar, sparkling
in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it.


 DEN                     (to himself)

                 Katherine!


He spurs his leopard/horse on into the night.


 CUT TO 

ANOTHER PART OF THE NEVERWHERE DESERT 
The QUEEN, riding a flying lizard, leads her army in pursuit
of DEN.


 SOLDIER                     (pointing)

                 There he is, your Majesty!


 CUT TO 

QUEEN'S P.O.V. 
Up ahead, silhouetted in the moonlight, she sees DEN, riding up
the steps of the pyramid.  The camera pans to the green glow
atop the torch-lit pyramid.


 QUEEN (V.O.) 
                 The Loc-Nar!


 CUT TO 

THE QUEEN 

 QUEEN                     (shouting to her men)

                 Faster!  To the pyramid!


She whips her lizard harder.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
ARD is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks
stand beside him, holding the struggling KATHERINE out over
the pool.


 ARD 
                 Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec.
                 Now, give me your power!
                 (to monks)
                 Throw her in.


Chanting the name "Uluhtec", the two monks start to throw
the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and
grabs her, kicking the other two monks into the water.

The intruder's hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the
moonlight.


 DEN 
                 Katherine!


 KATHERINE 
                 Den!


 ARD 
                 No!  You'll ruin everything!


ARD jumps up and runs toward the Loc-Nar, perched in the stone
idol's hand.  Grabbing it, ARD holds the glowing ball above him.


 ARD                     (to his guards)

                 Kill them!  Kill them both!


Suddenly, a hand leaps out of the darkness, gripping the
Loc-Nar just above Ard's hand - it is the QUEEN.


 QUEEN 
                 The Loc-Nar is mine!


 ARD                     (struggling)

                 Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!


As ARD and the QUEEN fight over the Loc-Nar, the Queen's troops
pour in and battle with Ard's soldiers.  Thunder roars overhead.


 CUT TO 

DEN 
Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and
grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around
him, DEN looks up at the sky.


 CUT TO 

THE SKY 
Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity.


 CUT BACK TO 

DEN 
DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around
the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the
other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear
with all his might into the head of the stone idol.

In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky,
striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through
the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the
electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.

Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green,
then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The
troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all
that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air.


 KATHERINE                     (to Den)

                 Where did they go?


 DEN 
                 They are gone.  That is all
                 that matters.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 They probably went back to Earth.
                 Boy, will Mom be surprised.


Suddenly, the Loc-Nar falls to the ground at Den's feet.


 KATHERINE                     (looking down)

                 The Loc-Nar ... you could have the
                 power of Uluhtec.  You could be
                 ruler over all these people.


 DEN                     (looking over the throng)

                 Forget it.


In a single powerful leap, DEN, carrying KATHERINE, bounds up
onto the Queen's flying lizard and they fly off.  The amazed troops
watch for a moment, then shrug and resume fighting.


 CUT TO 

DEN'S FLYING LIZARD 
KATHERINE clings to DEN as they fly.


 KATHERINE 
                 Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar
                 you could have returned to Earth.


 DEN 
                 I like it better here.


The lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the
distance.


 DAN (V.O.) 
                 On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here,
                 I am DEN.


 CUT TO 

THE NEVERWHERE PYRAMID 
The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere,
which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As
we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid
ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves
and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in
the ground.

A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.
Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.

Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and
a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the
fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,
when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing
ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.
Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.

Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,
placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the
Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.
As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched
Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.

Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and
clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval
village.

A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with
his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.
Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself
a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.
The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking
the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.

Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and
transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and
the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-
lit village green.

A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and
circles the green.

Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-
looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This
is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the
woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and
leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo
and leans provocatively up against the well.

The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman
and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We
pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.
Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's
body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,
where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.

As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles
away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-
housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes
dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning
sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim
coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on
their way to work.

The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.
Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard
ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner
and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings
the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and
load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now
full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become
deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the
weight.

A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.
Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the
glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered
over by rubble.

The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape
grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.
As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but
desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.


 CUT TO 

PEOPLE 
The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying
futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by
a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As
he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot
on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-
shovels.

One of the workers finds something.


 WORKER 
                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!


The archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-
driven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs
in and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has
sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.
It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman
plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.

As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.
The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,
then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's
entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.

The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the
glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.


 DISSOLVE TO 

NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The camera comes down from high above the city.  The general
shape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get
closer we sense that something is different.  Fires are
burning in various locations below us, and intermittent
gunshots become audible as the narration begins.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre
                 of the world.


Moving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and
slummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.
Below us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball
in the garbage-filled street.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 ... and now they're talking about
                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,
                 too.


Under the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down
through the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on
the newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across
the front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,
July 6, 2031

One headline reads: "400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend".
Another reads: "Venus Declared 73rd State".
The camera stops on a headline reading: "Professor Discovers
Ancient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum".

There is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and
his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case
containing the Loc-Nar.

A knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws
down the newspaper.


 YOUNG MAN                     (from outside)

                 You free?


 HARRY 
                 Yeah.  Get in.
 (V.O.)                  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive
                 a cab.

He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.


 CUT TO 

OUTSIDE CAB 
The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.
Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The
vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic
chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.


 CUT TO 

INSIDE CAB 
Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from
his passenger.


 HARRY 
                 Where to, pal?


 YOUNG MAN 
                 The U.N. Building.


 HARRY 
                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.
                 Used to be a nice place until they
                 turned it into low rent housing.
                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live
                 there if you paid me.


He switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's
cab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti
-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a
decrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading "Continuous Live
Sex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling", new ultra-tech
buildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office
buildings, garbage everywhere.

Inside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,
sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,
and holds the gun to Harry's head.


 YOUNG MAN 
                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,
                 now!


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 This city is really going to the
                 dogs.


Harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.
A buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly
dematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head
falls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it
into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic
guns and weapons.


 HARRY (V.O.) 
                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches
                 me unless I want 'em to.


CUT TO 

EXT. METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT 
The camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main
entrance.  The banner reads; "Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming
July 8th".

We pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing
through the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.
It is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter
runs out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.


GIRL 
Father!


PROFESSOR 
Run!


The girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser
guns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)
bends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.


RUDNICK (to henchmen)

He's dead.  Get the girl!


The girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as
Harry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding
on the window.


GIRL (to Harry)

Help me, please!!


A laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.
HARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves
her in.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Normally my rule is "Don't
get involved", but something
about this dame got to me.


She dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams
away as Laser-shots land all around.


GIRL (in shock, breathless)

The Loc-Nar ... they wanted
it ... but my father wouldn't
tell them ... now I'm the only
one ...


CUT TO 

HARRY 
HARRY (interupting)

Relax sister.  There's a cop
station up here.  You can ...


HARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.


HARRY (V.O.) 
Just what I needed ... guess
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.


CUT TO 

POLICE STATION 
The police station is an all-metal building with no windows.
A plaque on thr front reads "N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION".

Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious
GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.


VOICE (over intercom)

Police.  Whaddya want?


HARRY 
I wanna report a murder.


VOICE (over intercom)

So what else is new?


HARRY 
You gonna let me in or what?


A buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the
GIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As
he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum
cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles
of weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.


COP #1 
Okay, this guy's clean - next.


HARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl
down in a chair.


DESK SERGEANT (to Harry)

Before you go any further pal, I
gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A
thousand bucks a day for a full investigation.
Another thousand if the assailant is caught.
Got it?


HARRY 
Yeah thanks ...


He picks up the girl and turns to leave.


HARRY ... for nuthin'!


DESK SERGEANT (shouting after Harry)

You think you can do better?
Join one of the vigilante groups.
There's a list of 'em outside.


CUT TO 

EXT. POLICE STATION 
HARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as
a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops
emerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.


GREEN ALIEN 
I tell you I'm an American citizen.
I just lost my papers.


COP (to himself)

Goddamn illegal aliens.


HARRY heads toward his cab.


HARRY (V.O.) 
So here I was, stuck with this beautiful
girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'
but trouble ...


He looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway
and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.


HARRY (V.O.) 
... but I didn't feel right just
leaving her for the sickos.  I
dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental
or something ...


DISSOLVE TO 

INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT 
This futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly
coloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf
underneath a neon "Buweiser" clock.  The place is a mess.

HARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to "On",
and lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket
he looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn
in all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.


GIRL 
Where am I?


HARRY 
My place ...


Walking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button
and a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the
glass.  She sits up and drinks.


GIRL (looking at Harry)

They'd have killed me if it
wasn't for you.


HARRY 
What'd they want to snuff you
for?

               In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain 
               trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry.

               GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his 
               seventies.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely.

               Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         I haven't talked about it for years, 
                         you know?
                              (looks at the camera)
                         Everyone called me crazy...

               Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         But I have the negative.

               Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, 
               dramatic effect.

                                     TECHNICIAN'S VOICE
                         Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         It all started back in ´44. I was a 
                         Corps photographer aboard an allied 
                         submarine...

               INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, 
               again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a 
               submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges.

               35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as 
               a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         ...off the coast of Scotland. 
                         Classified mission. I was 21...

               SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform 
               soaked in sweat.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         We had an English civilian on board. 
                         Not much older than me but already 
                         an advisor to President Roosevelt. 
                         "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not --

               Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a 
               small...

               INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading" 
               an ancient set of Tarot cards.

               TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in 
               his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the

                         The sooner we're done, the better.

               Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. 
               It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much

               He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets.

               Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT 
               CARD: THE DEVIL.

               INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT

               Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.

               It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short 
               tunnel carved into the mountain.

               Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside 
               Broom.

               They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the 
               small box. It's full of rosaries.

               Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ 
               contemplates the scene from above.

                                     WHITMAN
                         You are a Catholic??

               Whitman locks and loads an automatic.

                         "professor."

               He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has 
               no eyes.

               EXT. DITCH

               MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the 
               move. Broom catches up with Whitman.

                                     WHITMAN

                         Oh, I'll bet you have.

               Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he 
               sees lights.

                                     MATLIN
                         Sweet Jesus.

               Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive 
               ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS 
               swarm among thick stone walls and archways.

               A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel 
               MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK 
               LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.

               Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears 
               respond!

               Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty 
               metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and 
               signals for more floodlights to be turned on.

               EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT

               The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone 
               saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully 
               extended.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No matter what happens to me, you 
                         must carry on with the work.

               ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes 
               an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.

               He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand-
               drawn notes and illustrations.

                                     GRIGORY
                         This will guide you back to me.

               He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I grant you everlasting life, youth 
                         and the power to serve me.

               He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then 
               wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation 
               and a ritual.

               VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET 
               glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket 
               watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.

               Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and 
               copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.

                                     VON KRUPT

               He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella 
               to shield her master from the pouring rain.

                                     VON KRUPT

                         There will be no failure, General. I 
                         promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll 
                         deliver one.

               Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box 
               containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.

               Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with 
               the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.

               EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT

               The Americans fan out, unseen.

               Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid 
               a German foot patrol.

               Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT 

               Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind 
               him.

                                     GRIGORI
                         Tonight, We will open a portal and

                         new eden will arise.

               He looks down at the machine and whispers --

               He flexes his fingers and in response --

               -- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central 
               axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and 
               pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain 
               to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.

               Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.

               One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the 
               machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.

               A blade of light opens in the air!

               Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT

               The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN 
               GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light 
               tears loose and flies in.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: 
               seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.

               Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie 
               slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens 
               a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...

               Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT  

               Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, 
               his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.

               CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.

               EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him 
               down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.

                                     WHITMAN

               Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.

               EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with 
               the GOLD CYLINDERS.

                         We have to stop them!!!

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.  
               Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.

               The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But 
               something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!

               The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the 
               squad of Allies storms the area.

               A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun 
               the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.

               VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But 
               Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.

               Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and 
               grabs a grenade from his belt.

               TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel 
               bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, 
               mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. 
               The steel chops clean through their weapons.

               Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.

               CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.

               Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after 
               it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As 
               his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!

               Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where 
               two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.

               Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the 
               earth right next to MATLIN.

                         Grigory!

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, 
               his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly 
               implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal 
               glove, empty and smoking.

               As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.

               Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen. 
               Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, 
               nothing more.

               EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT

               Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.

                                     MATLIN

                         No. It's not.

               He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer 
               rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.

                         From where??!!

               Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and 
               hell.

               EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT

               Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using 
               flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them 
               has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.

               EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

               Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman 
               roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.

                                     MATLIN

                         clubbed, drowned and castrated.

                         That makes him more than a hundred --

               A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun 
               as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves, 
               accompanied by a loud scrape.

               Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling 
               statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!! 
               Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.

               The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail 
               of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --

                                     MATLIN
                         It's got a big stone -- in its hand --

                         I think that is its hand.

               Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone 
               saint.

               WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom 
               stops him from firing.

                                     BROOM
                         Wait --

               In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden 
               eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.

               Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. 
               Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED 
               THING shrinks back.

               Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his 
               lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark 
               comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons 
               around it.

               The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with 
               tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. 
               Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the 
               chocolate.

                         that whammer!

               Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows 
               the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.

               Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers 
               snatch the candy. Broom smiles.

                                     BROOM
                         It's a boy. Just a baby boy.

               EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

               The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin 
               prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom 
               smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, 
               patting him gently. CLICK!!!

                         want to set the record straight before 
                         I go.

               Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. 
               He smiles, full of memories.

               In the thick of a snowstorm, THREE FIGURES climb the icy

               Super: BIRGAU PASS, MOLDAVIA, PRESENT DAY.

               EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS (SET), EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

               The THREE FIGURES move through a narrow passage until they 
               reach a DEAD END.

               FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and 
               consults Grigory's LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The symbol matches an 
               illustration in the book.

               Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer, 
               FIGURE 1 breaks through.

               Figure 2 produces two small GOLD INGOTS. Hands one to the 
               guide. Keeps the other one.

               The Guide examines his pay greedily: engraved in it: a 
               SWASTIKA.

               From an opening somewhere above, eerie blue light streams 
               down on a magnificent labyrinth.

               A few more fireflies speckle the air, winking on and off.

               The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the 
               inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental 
               scale of the walkways and ramparts.

               At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in 
               grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin.

               FIGURE 3 uncovers his face: he's a PEASANT GUIDE.

               throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On 
               them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought, 
               the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold.

               TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest 
               from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward.

               FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in 
               his hand.

               The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and 
               KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his 
               blade in the snow and takes back the gold.

               Ilsa watches the Sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming 
               rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin.

               A FIGURE RISES FROM THE BLOOD. A naked human shape, haloed 
               by fireflies.

               Broom looks down: first card off the deck: DEATH.

               EXT. N.Y. - MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

               Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated 
               for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of 
               Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN.

               Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward 
               a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the 
               door.

               Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street 
               vendor.

               In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED,

               EXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY

               On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex 
               rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the 
               rock below.

               SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK,

               EXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY

               A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate. 
               Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The 
               driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old 
               fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT"

               A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Yes?

                         Look at the birdie, son.

               Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea 
               is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers 
               appear. CLACK! The gate opens.

               EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY

               The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY

               Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers 
               approaches.

                                     MYERS
                         Hello, I'm --

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Two steps back, please.

               Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He 
               realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND 
               HOLDING A SWORD.

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Watch your hands and elbows.

               Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's 
               on a small elevator.

               INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY

               The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes 
               on.

               INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY

               He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving 
               up and down in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK

               The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights 
               flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the 
               floor is a huge number: 51.

               Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door.

               Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE (FULL AQUARIUM)- DUSK

               Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of 
               them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes 
               everything in an intimate, warm light.

               One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge 
               tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to 
               the tank.

                                     VOICE
                         Turn the pages, please.

               Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.

                                     VOICE
                         Over here... if you don't mind?

               In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus Christ!

               Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each 
               supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering 
               intently.

               Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns 
               streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with 
               intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are 
               bubbling.

                                     MYERS

                         These -- ? You're reading these -- ?

               Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.

               Myers extends his hand in greeting --

                         Sir, I'm --

               BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes 
               his eyes -- all three lids.

               Abe's voice surges from the speaker.

                         away.

               Broom uncovers a tray by the tank: Four greenish eggs. Myers 
               gags and reels back.

               the eggs as they float through the hatch.

               Myers and Broom walk down a corridor. The walls are lined 
               with glass cases containing occult artifacts. Myers eyes a 
               MUMMIFIED HAND, a CLAY GOLEM, a sumptuous PAGAN ALTAR...

               He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.

               Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an

               They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. 
               Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a

                                     BROOM
                         Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. 
                         Follow his lead.

               Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.

                                     MYERS
                         You're not coming?

               Broom signals "no."

                                     BROOM
                         I hand-picked you from a roster of 
                         over seventy academy graduates. Make 
                         me proud.

               The door closes behind him.

                                     CLAY
                         They're not speaking. Professor Broom 
                         had him grounded.

                                     MYERS
                         Grounded? Who's grounded?

                                     CLAY
                         Okay. You saw the fish man, right?

               Myers nods.

                                     CLAY
                         Well, come on in and meet the rest 
                         of the family.

               Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door. 
               Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open 
               up.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, 
               austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS. 
               Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the 
               furniture.

               There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era.

               On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of 
               blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD.

                                     CLAY
                              (sotto voce)
                         He gets fed six times a day. He's 
                         got a thing for cats. You'll be his 
                         nanny, his keeper, his best friend. 
                         He never goes out unsupervised --

                                     MYERS
                         Who?!

               Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers 
               picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a 
               U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape.

               Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out 
               of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats 
               playfully paws at it.

                                     MYERS

                         Those comics -- They never got the 
                         eyes right.

               The voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Clay, sotto voce)
                         Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --

                                     CLAY
                              (sotto voce)
                         Yup. Sixty years old by our count.  
                         But he doesn't age like we do -- 
                         think dog years: He's barely out of 
                         his teens.

               Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, 
               exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson 
               biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What's with the hair, Clay?? Finally 
                         got those implants??

               Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.

                                     CLAY
                         It'll fill in. Where do you want 
                         your dinner, Red? By the couch?

               On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer 
               cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears 
               over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face 
               and raven-black hair.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Who's the squirt?

                                     CLAY
                         Agent Myers is your new liaison.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Got tired of me?

                                     CLAY
                         Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back 
                         in the field.

               BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers 
               jumps.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I don't want him.

                              Myers)
                         The candy. Give him the candy.

               Myers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths.

                                     MYERS

                         Still angry?

                                     CLAY
                         Well, you did break out --

                         It's nobody's business.

                         It is. You got yourself on TV again.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "Myers", huh? You have a first name??

                         Try not to stare. He hates when people 
                         stare.

                         His horns. He files 'em. To "fit

                         His what??!!

               Hellboy finally enters the light. He's awe-inspiring, with 
               chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden 
               eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils.

               In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Whatcha looking at, John??

               An ALARM sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. Myers 
               looks around, bewildered.

                                     HELLBOY

               EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments. 
               A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER.

               Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN 

               Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED 
               POLICE.

               Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan 
               cars are waved through.

                                     BLONDE REPORTER
                         The NYPD has yet to issue a statement. 
                         We've got SWAT vans, paramedics, you 
                         name it...  and now here's -- a 
                         garbage truck --
                              (double take)
                         -- a garbage truck?

               Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a 
               mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management 
               Services.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK - LIBRARY STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.

               EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens 
               of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED 
               POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT

               The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors 
               are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped 
               crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.

               ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a 
               mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he 
               inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills. 

               Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.

                         sheet of glass between them and us.

                         Story of my life.

                         You mean, outside... with her.

               Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, 
               rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of 
               stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't get psychic with me.

                         Nothing psychic about it. You're 
                         easy.

               Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD 
               SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, 
               double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable 
               cannon.

                         How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I 
                         drive around in a garbage truck

                                     ABE
                         Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.

               EXT. COURTYARD / LOADING DOCK MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops.

               FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed 
               cops and securing the doors.

               THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate, 
               sealing off the area.

                         All areas secured.

               From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear.

                         coming in.

               The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the 
               dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing 
               HELLBOY and ABE.

                                     CLAY
                         Okay, boys, let's synch up our 
                         locators.

               Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They 
               BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking.

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT

               As BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy 
               march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases. 
               Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase.

                         checked this place. Fakes, and 
                         reproductions.

               Broom stands at the base of the marble staircase.

                         Father...?

               Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze 
               from that of the fragile old man.

               INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT

               They approach an oversize set of brass doors.

               Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads 
               his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids 
               and concentrates.

               Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers 
               observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of 
               bullets of all colors and shapes.

                         we hold a copy.

               Hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader.

                         Evil, ancient and hungry.

               Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of 
               ancient magic.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, well. Lemme go in and say "hi".

               As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow 
               illuminates him. He steps inside.

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; 
               piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen 
               display case.

               He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and 
               statues startle him.

               On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of 
               uniforms and hats.

                                     HELLBOY

               The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches 
               his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to 
               discover --

               A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. 
               SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles 
               and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, 
               but the jaws are shiny with blood.

               Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one 
               of the books.

                                     ABE
                         There's not much here: the entity's 
                         name is Sammael, the desolate one, 
                         son of Nergal --

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the 
               neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble 
               and criss- crossed with blue veins.

                         shot, but --

                         this out?

               Sammael stands and turns around -- CRACK-KKK!!! His waist 
               twists him 360 degrees!!

               Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!!

               Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns 
               apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through 
               it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The 
               monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it 
               grows still.

               Hellboy turns away for a moment. Puts his gun away, like a 
               gunslinger.

               arm!! Hellboy CRASHES into the brass doors!

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - EXHIBIT CORRIDORS - NIGHT

               The doors bulge and crack under Hellboy's impact.

               Abe and Broom backpedal fast. Myers pulls out his gun, and 
               starts looking for another way in. Broom observes this, 
               pleased.

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT

               Sammael lashes out with a massive punch.

               HELLBOY goes K-KKRASH!!! K-KKRASH!!! through SIX glass 
               cabinets, then hits a window, falling --

               EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               -- two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage 
               bin. Hellboy fights to stay conscious. Blood drips from his 
               mouth

                         Child...

               Hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition, 
               is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded 
               by pitch-black sunglasses

                                     GRIGORY
                         All grown up, I see.

               Hellboy's in shock, confused.

                         Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.

               Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground. 
               He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I can see that you're still young 
                         and don't know your place.
                              (turns to Sammael)
                         Teach him.

               Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --

               WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth 
               like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from 
               its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.

               Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. 
               The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's 
               skin.

               EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the 
               alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER 
               BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal 
               SQUEAL!!

               Hellboy manages to roll away.

               Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover 
               behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What do you think you're doing??

               Myers proudly shows him the gun.

                                     MYERS
                         Helping you -- I just --

                         No one ever helps me. It's my job.

               He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too 
               much.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Damn -- Okay. Here --

               He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his 
               belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (throws it at Myers)
                         -- Then load this.

               In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's a tracking bullet. Crack the 
                         pin. Load it.

               KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. 
               Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.

               Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows 
               like a chemical flare.

                                     MYERS
                         Jeez... What the hell is that?

               He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, 
               a big, black stinger is gleaming.

               Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe 
               grape.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Lemme go ask --

               Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue 
               instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.

               BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly 
               green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then -- 
               BAM!!!!

               INSIDE GUN SHOT

               The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --

               EXT. ALLEY

               -- Sammael, still in mid-air.

               It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!!

               With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles 
               after it.

               EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT

               On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP.

               He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers 
               lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.

                                     MYERS
                         Wait! No, what are you doing?

               LOADING DOCK / ALLEY

               Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full 
               tilt.

               A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A 
               few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.

                                     WORKER 1
                         What the hell is that??

               Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting 
               the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area.

               A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch.

               Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick-
               or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON.

               Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.

                                     3 WORKERS
                              (chorus)
                         Whoa-whoa-whoa-

               Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: 
               CRASH!!!

               The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, 
               showered by thousands of glass shards.

               Myers is a few steps behind.

                                     MYERS
                              (into headset)
                         We'll hit the street in a minute. 
                         We're heading towards civilians...

               He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The 
               vendors are yelling at him.

                                     MYERS
                         Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick 
                         or treat!!

               EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

               Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps 
               straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision 
               as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR 
               TREATERS scream.

               Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as 
               Myers follows --

               He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!

               Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers, 
               holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.

               The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with 
               a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.

               Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major 
               traffic jam.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Myers opens his eyes, nods.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Good. Stay here.

               He moves after Sammael.

               OMIT

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At 
               the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael's 
               gone.

               He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.

               EXT./INT. STUNT TRACKS TUNNEL - NIGHT

               He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away. 
               Seated.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Waiting for me, Sammy?

               A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles 
               and puts away his gun.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh-oh -- between a rock and a hard 
                         place --

               But Sammael sprints towards it!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap --

               Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm, 
               then jumps at the front car --

               OMIT

               INT. STUNT TRACKS / FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               smashing through glass and steel and raining sparks. Landing 
               inside with a ROAR!!! --

               EXT./INT. THE SUBWAY - 2 TRAIN CAR SET - NIGHT

               SAMMAEL's tongue punches through the doors as he races through 
               one -- two -- passenger cars and out the --

               STUNT TRACK REAR 1/4 CAR

               -- rear of the train, back onto the tracks.

               INT. STUNT  TRACKS - NIGHT

               Landing there safely.

               INT. THE SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) - NIGHT

               Now the train hurtles at Hellboy, who grimaces and does his 
               best --

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               He leaps, but HUMPF!! He's hit! His legs rattle over the 
               tracks.

               INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through 
               the steel floor and grabs a handhold. Steam and sparks explode 
               everywhere.

               The TRAIN DRIVER grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming 
               it against Hellboy's head.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey! Hey! I'm on your side!!

               BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making 
               sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead 
               smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He 
               follows it, until it ends abruptly.

               He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of 
               glowing goop hits his hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, I forgot --

               He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops. 
               Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug.

               Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the 
               creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex.

               Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re-
               knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to 
               tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A 
               deep wound.

               Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking 
               THIRD RAIL a few feet away.

               Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw you.

               Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes 
               both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy 
               lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- 
               is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still.

               Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a 
               flame on his arm to light a cigar.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I'm fireproof.

                              the body)

               EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is 
               being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses.

               Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form. 
               His radio beeps.

                                     HELLBOY (V.O.)
                         Myers??? How's your arm?

               Myers moves away from the POLICE OFFICERS.

               Hellboy walks away from the smoking Sammael carcass.

                         I take a break.

                         Goodbye.

               He turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness 
               of the tunnel.

               In the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred 
               body.

               INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT

               An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined 
               with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. 
               Kroenen stands next to it.

               ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She 
               stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving 
               her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. 
               Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he 
               turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his 
               hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's 
               body. He cradles it like a precious stone.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (smiling)
                         Sammael has fulfilled his destiny... 
                         Die in peace and be reborn again and 
                         again...

               He closes his fist.

                                     ILSA
                         Only seven more days to the eclipse, 
                         Grishka...

               Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by 
               moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in 
               fascination.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The child will be there. And so will 
                         we all -- Won't we?

               Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL 
               silhouettes appear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Manning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning

                                                                 MORPHS TO:

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK

               Hours earlier: the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness 
               spectrally as --

               A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking 
               sound, he shines his light into a dark corner: no one's there. 
               But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from 
               the pool of shadows on the floor.

               It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe. 
               On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly 
               ticking gears.

               He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN 
               STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT.

               Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.

                                     ILSA
                         Move.

               She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case.

               The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on.

               Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a 
               giant bone saw, slicing across the statue.

               No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears 
               and the top half falls.

               KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and 
               winds himself up.

               Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and 
               removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand.

               Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns 
               at Kroenen.

                                     GUARD 1
                         You! Don't move! Hands up!

               Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two 
               TWIN BLADES.

               bullet tears into Kroenen's arm, spewing forth an explosion 
               of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers 
               the steel, deflecting the bullets which --

               -- ricochet wildly -- and finally hit three of the guards. 
               They fall silently to the floor.

               Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives.

               The last guard raises his gun.

                                     GUARD 6
                         Don't --

               Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted 
               by an unseen force!!

               The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible 
               force. He starts floating in mid-air.

               The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows 
               red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in 
               shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding 
               an imaginary doll.

               His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, 
               gaining strength.

               With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts 
               of the guard's body in opposite directions.

               With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. 
               Grigory looks at Ilsa.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Ready the welcome, my love --

               Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto 
               the floor.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Salt. Gathered from the tears of a 
                         thousand martyrs. Restraining the 
                         essence of Sammael, the hell hound, 
                         the seed of destruction.

               Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting 
               glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. 
               He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle.

               Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines 
               fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. 
               Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, 
               GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL.

               It roars!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OMIT

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, 
               enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions 
               for the others to stay back.

               He extends his open palm and "feels" the air near the old 
               man's back.

                                     ABE
                         Professor..? You -- are very sick --

                                     BROOM
                         I don't want Hellboy to know --

               Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away.

                                     BROOM
                         Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to 
                         destroy the world. And they are back -- 
                         in my lifetime, they are back. To 
                         finish the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

               A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging 
               from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music 
               on picnic tables.

               On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer 
               and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, 
               a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.

               Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY 
               VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a...

               ...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with 
               barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with 
               paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden 
               surrounds the building.

               Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his 
               overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND 
               FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line 
               patients, distributing pills.

               Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries 
               the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale 
               skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark 
               eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands 
               circle her wrist.

               Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                              (pointing)
                         There's a big red guy down there!

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                              (readying more pills)
                         That's fine, darling, Santa's not 
                         here for another month.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                         Not Santa. Big and red. With gold 
                         eyes. And he has beer!

               Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of 
               the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her 
               skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below 
               seems empty.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT

               Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging 
               from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail 
               of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it...

                                     LIZ
                         Back so soon?

               Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat. 
               His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh, I brought beer.

               Liz shoots a Polaroid.

                                     LIZ
                         To wash down my lithium pills?
                              (beat)
                         I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm 
                         still a patient.

               Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.

                                     LIZ
                         You better have that looked at.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Just a scratch.
                              (shrug)
                         I wanted to see you.

               Liz sighs.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT

               Hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz.

                                     HELLBOY
                         We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's 
                         crazier every day. And Father's still 
                         mad at me --
                              (Liz smiles)
                         Come back, Liz. Come back. I --

                                     LIZ
                         No. Not this time, H.B. It's been 
                         months since I've had an episode. 
                         And you know what? I'm learning to 
                         control it.

               Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms, 
               crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at 
               the pale flame.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm learning where it comes from.
                              (beat)
                         And for once in my life I'm not 
                         afraid.

               She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.

                                     LIZ
                         Looks like your ride is here.

               The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled 
               into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the 
               vehicles.

                                     HELLBOY
                         The Nanny Squad.

               ANGLE - THE CARS - CONTINUOUS

               Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns 
               to Broom:

                                     MYERS
                         Sir, may I go first??

                                     CLAY
                              (to Broom)
                         Not so fast. He barely knows him --

                                     BROOM
                              (cuts him off)
                         Then he should make it his business 
                         to change that.

               ANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS

               Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                     LIZ
                         Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out 
                         here. If you truly care about me, 
                         don't come back anymore.

               Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Goodnight, then.

                                     LIZ
                         Goodnight.

               She doesn't turn back.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do --

               Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his 
               feet, a pool of his own blood.

               He sees Myers tentatively approaching.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What took you so long?

                                     MYERS
                         C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you, a Boy Scout?

                                     MYERS
                         No. I never was.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (weak)
                         Could've fooled me. Go away.

               Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him. 
               Help him up.

                                     CLAY
                         C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, 
                         there.

                                     HELLBOY
                         This -- ? This is nothing. You know 
                         what'll kill me?
                              (points at the doorway)
                         Her.

               Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over. 
               A few of the agents help him to the vehicles.

               Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their 
               unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes 
               inside.

               OMIT

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY "A" - NIGHT

               In the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on 
               a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him.

               Abe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy's wounded arm.

                                     ABE
                         You were burned by some organic acid.

                         I'm lucky that way.

               Using a scalpel, Abe probes the gash. Hellboy lets out a 
               GRUNT.

                         Professor...

               Broom moves to Abe's side of the table. Abe is poking at the 
               depths of the wound.

                                     BROOM
                              (sharp, to Hellboy)

                         Is it bad?

               Broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's 
               forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS.

               Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits 
               it in a glass container.

                                     ABE

               The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, 
               an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.

                         The eggs are very sensitive to heat 
                         and light. They need a humid, dark 
                         environment to breed.

               Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to 
               Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.

                         Well, let's see -- there was that 
                         moment, when I had a train on top of 
                         my head --

               Broom frowns, worried.

                         agents, search the area, top to 
                         bottom.

               Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal 
               THING wiggles.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Myers stands by Broom's desk as the old man places a new set 
               of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank.

                         You're doing fine.

               At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting 
               in the shadows near the door.

                                     MYERS

               with intimate images of Hellboy as a KID. H.B. at 7, at 12, 
               dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side.

               Myers works at a computer workstation.

               He brings up a small photograph in an old issue of The 
               Enquirer. The headline: "ARSON SUSPECT NOW WORKING FOR SECRET 
               GOVERNMENT AGENCY" There's a photo of a woman, taken with a 
               telephoto lens.

               Another clipping: young LIZ, 11, and a photo of a tenement 
               building burned to the ground: TRAGIC EXPLOSION.

               A QUICKTIME interview pops up. LIZ, in her early twenties. A 
               caption reads: ELIZABETH SHERMAN, first interview, BPRD, 
               PYROKINETIC. She has a POLAROID camera in her hands. Shoots

                         I just don't. And "Pyrokinesis" sounds 
                         like psychosis or something. I dunno --

               Two strolling ORDERLIES shine their flashlights inside the 
               rooms on both sides of a long corridor.

               INT. HOSPITAL - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SECURITY WARD - NIGHT

               A flashlight beam sweeps Liz's room. It illuminates a 
               CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes 
               of everyday life.

               When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, 
               still asleep.

               As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. 
               Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the 
               bed, extending his right hand.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The Master is calling your name now, 
                         my girl. We are all part of his plan. 
                         You must return to the child... So, 
                         once again...

               He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin, 
               a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His 
               fingers start to glow.

                                     GRIGORY
                         ...dream of fire.

               Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.

                                                             FLASH BACK TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY

               Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang 
               banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement 
               courtyard.

               ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS

               Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone, 
               a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest.

               A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps, 
               carrying a basket of apples.

                                     MOTHER
                              (to Liz)
                         Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give 
                         Mummy a hand.

               Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated 
               apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.

                                     BLONDE KID
                         Freak!

               Liz turns to see them.

                                     BLONDE KID
                              (to his friend)
                         See? She knows her name.

               Liz shies away from them.

                                     BLONDE KID
                         Go home, you freak. We don't want 
                         you here.

               They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses 
               her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.

               Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. 
               She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering 
               the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across, 
               but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.

               A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale 
               blue flame rings her entire arm.

                                     LIZ
                              (sobbing)
                         Not again, please, not again...

               Firelight glints off the crucifix.

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - DAY

               MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A 
               heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.

                                     LIZ
                         Mommy! Mommy!

               Mother sees...

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - STEPS -  DAY

               Liz: outlined by licking flames!

                                     LIZ
                              (panicked)
                         Mommy! Help me! I'm burning!

               Mother screams, horrified.

                                     LIZ
                         Help meee!!!

               She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the 
               courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then 
               the rest of the people are --

               THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD

               -- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches, 
               people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment 
               blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.

               The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one 
               figure left standing:

               Liz... a little girl, still crying.

                                                          FLASH FORWARD TO:

               Liz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her 
               chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs.

               The rubber bands on her wrist vaporize.

               The glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor.

               In their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the 
               radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on 
               a panel.

               They silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low 
               rumble shakes the room.

               Through the VIBRATING glass window they see...

               CORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE

               ...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. 
               The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making 
               the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.

               As the glass explodes, the fire ROARS, drowning everything. 
               The orderlies hit the floor, taking cover under a shelf.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT

               The top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window,

               Inside, Hellboy is leaning over Broom, glaring at the old 
               man.

                                     HELLBOY
                         How many buildings does she have to 
                         burn? She belongs here!

                                     BROOM
                         That's not how she feels. She may 
                         never feel it.

               Myers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore 
               him.

                                     BROOM
                         It's her choice --
                              (beat)
                         She's human --

                         Oh, as opposed to -- ?

               Broom grows silent.

               Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held 
               belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every 
               time he goes at the round stumps.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --

                                     MYERS
                         Professor, that girl you were talking 
                         about --

                              (whirls around)
                         Hey. You: think twice --

                                     MYERS
                         I think I can help -- Talk to her -- 
                         I can bring her back.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (chuckles)
                         What landed you this job, pushing 
                         "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was 
                         your area of expertise?

               Myers murmurs --

                                     HELLBOY
                         What was that??

                                     MYERS
                         Hostage negotiations.

               Hellboy's face lights up.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

               Part of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen 
               are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris.

               Myers arrives in a taxi cab.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY

               Myers looks at LIZ through a see-through mirror. She sits on 
               a bench inside a padded cell. A security CAMERA AND MONITOR 
               records her constantly.

               A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him.

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                         She's been like this since it 
                         happened. There were no casualties. 
                         But it's put a big dent in our 
                         Thorazine supply...
                              (dubious look at Myers)
                         Are you sure you want to go in?

               Myers nods, loosens his tie and enters.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - PADDED CELL - DAY

               Liz doesn't acknowledge Myers' presence. He kneels and looks 
               up at her.

                                     MYERS
                         Miss Sherman? I'm Agent Myers, FBI.

               Liz turns away.

               She looks at him. He offers his hand. She looks away.

               Liz turns to the 2-way mirror. Both their reflections are 
               there.

               An explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes 
               through a dank tunnel. Then, light beams sweep the encrusted 
               walls and steel columns.

               Clay and some B.P.R.D. agents hold flashlights. Two of them -- 
               MOSS and QUARRY -- carry FLAMETHROWERS.

               Hellboy and Abe bring up the rear.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

               They enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets, 
               typewriters and school desks. A turn-of-the-century mural 
               depicts happy boys doing charitable acts. A Latin phrase 
               ("VIRILITER AGE") encourages them to behave like men.

                         orphanage. Closed since they moved 
                         the sewers in '51.

               Abe removes his gloves, hyperextends his palm and senses the 
               air. Then the surface of the water.

                                     ABE

               Debris and dust seem to float from the water's surface and

               BAMMM!!! Hellboy's stone hand cracks the concrete. He starts 
               pounding, again and again, like a jack hammer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace 
               ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING.

               At a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his 
               own.

               His face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible 
               lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw 
               gums and taut skin.

               As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a 
               spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles 
               blindly on the table.

               He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving 
               depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he 
               opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces 
               of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.

               The wall collapses under Hellboy's attack.

               Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman 
               effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out.

                         I'm glad I'm not human. This place

               Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator 
               on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices 
               synchronize.

               Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone.

                                     HELLBOY

               Abe ties the reliquary around his hand.

               As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines 
               float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the 
               chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. 
               Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing 
               albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans 
               from the past.

               Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished 
               letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866.

               Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a 
               hand mirror.

               Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an 
               adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer 
               caught in headlights.

                                     HELLBOY

               INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

               Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow 
               of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his 
               booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.

               Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, 
               a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent 
               egg!

               Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing.

               He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating 
               everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. 
               Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.

               Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.

               Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It 
               lands --

               on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab 
               it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up --

               -- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!!

               The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins 
               to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.

               Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing 
               Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to 
               reach deeper, screaming in rage.

               Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY

               The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND 
               SAMMAEL.

               INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY

               Hellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs 
               the air, then steps through a non-descript portal.

               INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY

               Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks 
               dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens 
               of old photos of children.

               He discovers the Sammael engraving.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "Sammael: seed of destruction. Death 
                         becomes the fertile ground."

               Suddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (turning)
                         Didn't I kill you already?

               Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service 
               shaft...

               ...and it's a long way down.

               When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, 
               however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side.

               They crash through pipes, wiring and ducts and slide off

               another passage. There they bounce off of dripping water 
               pipes and jutting steel I beams, until they finally break 
               through a mesh/insulation ceiling and directly onto --

               INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY

               A subway platform. Full of people.

               The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an 
               explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker 
               in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change.

               The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform 
               floor.

               Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of 
               turnstiles, uprooting them all.

               Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. 
               Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in 
               the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. 
               Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS 
               from the fleeing public.

               A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, 
               steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.

               Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --

               Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's 
               stone hand emerges, triumphant.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey, Chunk-face!

               He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You can do better than that. Big 
                         monster like you.

               Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael 
               again and again.

                                     HELLBOY
                         See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit 
                         people!

               Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds 
               itself in the tile wall.

               Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.

               Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second  
               mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, 
               scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.

               He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit 
               subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a 
               wooden bench, breaking it in two.

               Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.

               Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- 
               and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS 
               abandoned on a bench.

                                     YOUND GIRL
                         My kittens!! My kittens!!!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap.

               Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! 
               Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.

               Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking 
               citizens.

               Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, 
               blood dripping from his forehead and nose.

               Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots 
               out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps 
               the tongue with his stone hand --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Second date. No tongue!!

               -- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are 
               fine.

               Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.

               Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself 
               and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. 
               From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged 
               glass.

               Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.

               Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is 
               millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems 
               lost, when...

               WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight 
               for Sammael.

               It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. 
               Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks.

               Hellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in 
               BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the 
               platform.

                                     HELLBOY

               He moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out.

               Under the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S 
               EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst 
               out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending.

               Badly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not 
               there.

               He quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing 
               behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT.

               Abe staggers out of the pool and hides behind a crumbling 
               shower stall. Behind him, two SHAPES come to the surface.

               Shaking, Abe pushes his belt locator and collapses.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Back in the tunnel, Quarry and moss move filing cabinets and 
               rotten bozes full of files. One of them gives out and papers 
               spill all over.

                                     MOSS
                         Jesus --

                         Abe --

               Suddenly -- a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their 
               flashlights over the columns... Nothing there.

                                     QUARRY
                         Moss, what the hell was that?

               Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls 
               boom like thunderclaps.

               Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. 
               Useless: the things plow on.

               Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few 
               seconds, a green light beeps, READY.

               The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of  
               fire into the blackness.

               The men pause: silence!

               Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.

                                     QUARRY
                         Whatever it was --

               BAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands 
               on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight 
               bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare:

               TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully 
               squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the 
               creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head.

               Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an 
               obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the 
               flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back, 
               breaking his spine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Clay stumbles around, lost. He stops under a grate.

                         Clay, Code 30, this is Clay, over...

               Behind Clay, Kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through 
               shafts of gray light. He brings forth his customary long 
               blade. Clay turns in time to see Kroenen coming at him. He 
               fires. Kroenen stabs.

               Twin rivulets of blood run from Clay's nostrils.

               Clay falls to the floor.

               Kroenen stands there, unfazed by Clay's bullets in his chest. 
               Dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet. 
               He hears Hellboy coming.He places the knife on the floor, 
               then lies down and plays dead.

               Hellboy appears at the end of the tunnel. He glances at 
               Kroenen's body, then quickly checks for a pulse on Clay.

               Hellboy looks demolished.

               An ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her 
               head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She 
               passes it to Myers:

                                     LIZ
                         It feels good to be outside!! It's 
                         been so long...

               He can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the 
               bulletproof acrylic divider.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey!! The music!! Turn down the

                         Yeah, yeah, music!!

               He merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the 
               same volume. Myers looks back at Liz.

               She is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus! That's not -- That's not safe, 
                         Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman?

               She takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers 
               looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the 
               other window, hands her the photograph.

                                     MYERS
                         Nice view --

               He waves at her. For the first time, she smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         A smile, huh? That's good.

               She takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing 
               Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.

                                     LIZ
                         Don't get used to it.

               Myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music. 
               He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD.

               Unconscious, Abe floats in a special tank. LED strips read 
               water temperature, pH level, etc. He's encased in a bio-cast: 
               a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right 
               arm. A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place.

               SHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if 
               in a trance.

                         won't survive the night. You're 
                         reckless.

                         Ah, I see. That makes it all alright 
                         then.

               He turns to leave. Hellboy gets up.

                                     HELLBOY
                         No, it doesn't make it right, but I 
                         stopped that creature, didn't I?

                                     MANNING
                         That's what you do. That's why we 
                         need you. You have an insight.
                              (beat)
                         You know monsters.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you trying to say?

                                     MANNING
                         In the end, after you've killed and 
                         captured every freak out there -- 
                         there's still one left: you.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (a deep sigh)
                         I wish I could be more gracious but --

               BAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand 
               and raises it above his head.

               Manning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous 
               thing.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY

               A new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass 
               B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer 
               stations and tactical glass boards.

               Liz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks 
               around and sees BROOM coming down the hall.

                                     BROOM
                         Welcome back.

                                     LIZ
                         It's only for the weekend, Professor 
                         Broom. Then I'll be on my way --

                                     BROOM
                              (impeccable courtesy)
                         Come and go as you please.
                              (beat)
                         Find your way back. We've made quite 
                         a few changes --

               CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through 
               a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the 
               middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs.

               Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed.

                                     MANNING
                              (gasping)
                         I want that thing locked up, starting 
                         now -- Now!!! You hear me??!!

               He flees.

                                     LIZ
                              (to Broom)
                         Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home.

               Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps 
               through the hole in the wall.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (seeing her)
                         Liz? Liz!!

               She spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You!!! You did it, buddy --

               Myers holsters his gun and follows Liz. Hellboy is all alone 
               now.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (oblivious)
                         Woo hoo!!

               INT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY

               A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz 
               throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway.

               She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, 
               then lets it snap.

                                     LIZ
                         A little something I learned in 
                         therapy. I'm depressed --
                              (snaps a rubber band)
                         One rubber band. I'm impatient: two 
                         rubber bands...

               He sits by her side on the bed.

                                     MYERS
                         I'll get you a fresh pack.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK

               A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: 
               DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it 
               in a brimming wastebasket.

               He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, 
               writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is 
               covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the 
               projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload 
               of CHILI.

                                     MYERS
                         Where do you --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Shh! Just a second.

               Myers sets the tray on the table.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Myers, you're a talker. What's a 
                         good word -- a solid word for "need" --

                                     MYERS
                         "Need" is a good, solid word.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Nah, sounds too "needy."

                                     MYERS
                         Start in, you got nachos coming.

               As he goes out, Liz appears in the doorway. Hellboy quickly 
               stops writing.

                                     LIZ
                              (notices the small 
                              feline army)
                         Oh, my God... Look at them all! Who 
                         had babies? C'mere, Tiger...!

               Liz plays with a cat. Hellboy lifts the piece of paper, which 
               looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Um... Liz -- I -- there's something 
                         I'd like you to -- something I need 
                         you to hear.

                                     LIZ
                         Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, 
                         but --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Out? Out out?

                                     LIZ
                         For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, 
                         read.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You're going alone?

                                     LIZ
                         No. Myers is taking me.

               Hellboy stands up, walks towards her.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Him!! Why him? Why not me?

               Myers walks back in pushing a tray of nachos.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Hey, your chili's getting cold --

                                     HELLBOY
                              (sits back down)
                         Not hungry.

                                     LIZ
                         What did you want me to hear -- ?

               Hellboy folds the paper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's nothing. Just a list -- It's 
                         not finished --

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.

               She leaves. Myers smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         Anything else you --

                                     HELLBOY
                              (snappy)
                         Not from you.

                                     MYERS
                         Well good n-

                              (furious)
                         Good night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. B.D.R.P. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

               Under a sheet, Kroenen's cold, naked body lies on a slab. 
               Broom talks into a tape recorder.

                                     BROOM
                         The subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen --

               The visible areas of the body make us grateful for the sheet 
               covering the rest.

                                     BROOM
                         Suffered a masochistic compulsion 
                         known as surgical addiction.

               The silver hand and harness lie on a table.

                                     BROOM
                         Both eyelids were surgically removed 
                         along with his upper and lower lips, 
                         making speech impossible. The blood 
                         in his veins dried up decades ago. 
                         Only dust remains.
                              (looks at an X-ray 
                              film)
                         Four pulverized vertebrae. A steel 
                         rod inserted into his pelvis held 
                         him up.
                              (beat)
                         What horrible will power could keep 
                         a thing like this alive?

               He finds the small pieces of paper Kroenen planted in his 
               pouch.

               INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

               Under the gaze of high-security cameras, AGENT LIME rolls 
               Hellboy's food cart down the corridor and into the domed 
               intersection. He whistles a happy tune. Opens the high 
               security door.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Lime's jaw drops.

               Across the room, one of the walls has been completely 
               demolished, revealing a SERVICE SHAFT.

               No sign of Hellboy.

                                     LIME
                         Jesus.

               Lime peeks into the SERVICE SHAFT.

               OMIT

               EXT. NEWARK, N.J. - STREETS - NIGHT

               Myers and Liz leave a coffee shop, strolling down the street. 
               Myers hands Liz her coffee. They chat and laugh. He pushes 
               his Moped. She has her Polaroid with her.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you two talking about. What's 
                         so fascinating?? So important?? 

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

               Liz and Myers pause at a corner, waiting for the light. The 
               shops are closing.

                                     MYERS
                         I admire him. He's a force of nature.

                                     LIZ
                         He's just pushy.

                                     MYERS
                         No... He's determined. Unstoppable --

                                     LIZ
                         Cocky.

                                     MYERS
                         Strong.

                                     LIZ
                         A brute.

                                     MYERS
                         My uncle used to say... we like people 
                         for their qualities but love them 
                         for their defects.

               Liz half-smiles, sips her coffee.

                                     MYERS
                         He -- loves you.

                                     LIZ
                         I know.

                                     MYERS
                         What about you?

                                     LIZ
                         Don't know. Really. I grew up with 
                         him.
                              (beat)
                         I've missed him too, but now, every 
                         time I see him, I get confused. Hardly 
                         a day goes by he's not in my mind. 
                         Even now, I feel he's here --

               As they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof 
               tops.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at 
               Myers and Liz --

               Myers offers her cream and sugar.

                         No cream and sugar, moron. She takes 
                         it black.

               She takes the coffee, waves off the half and half.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Toldya.

               Trying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz 
               gestures vigorously. His smile fades.

                         It's freezing, isn't it?

                         Coffee's warming me up.

               By now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park 
               near a train track.

                                     MYERS
                         What do we do now? Newark, New Jersey, 
                         entertainment capital of the world.

               She cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down.

                                     LIZ
                         You offered me a cup of coffee. I've 
                         got one, so just sit down.

               Myers is falling for her.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               Hellboy leaps off a building.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing, 
               Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon 
               coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hi...

               The kid stares at him.

                                     KID
                         You're Hellboy.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Shh. I'm... on a mission.

               He watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't tell anyone, huh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Broom examines the damage to the wall. He turns to see 
               Hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. Broom shakes his 
               head.

                                     LIME
                         Should we send out some scouts?

               Broom motions for him to stop. It's useless,

                                     BROOM
                         No. Enough. He will never change -- 
                         always a child. Always. 

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

               Kroenen's body lies on the table. Slowly, his chest starts 
               to rise and fall. He sits up.

               His arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- Click! He 
               flexes the shiny fingers.

               Kroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before 
               he zips up his mask. He takes the sharp Ragnarok knives and 
               turns one over. It reflects a figure standing behind him: 
               Grigory.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses 
               of milk and a plate of cookies.

                                     KID
                         My Mom baked 'em.

               He sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting 
               and laughing.

                                     HELLBOY
                         That's it: she's laughing. I'm done.

               Hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them 
               down.

                                     KID
                         They don't look like spies.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Come on! Look at him, those shifty 
                         eyes, that -- phony grin...!!
                              (seeing the last cookie)
                         You gonna eat that?

               Below, Myers yawns. Hellboy slaps his forehead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, the yawning trick. That's so 
                         1950's! Watch his arm --

               He looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it.

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREET - LIZ AND MYERS - NIGHT

                                     MYERS
                         We all have a side that we try to 
                         hide...

               Myers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back. 
               Something hits him in the head.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey! What the hell?

               He gets up, annoyed. No one in sight.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy snickers, hiding and chewing a cookie. The Kid "gives 
               him five".

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Kroenen's two pieces of paper are joined together under a 
               MICRO-SCANNER. Broom watches as computer enhancement fills 
               out a couple of missing areas.

               Cyrillic letters are now legible.

                                     BROOM

                         SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16... Moscow.

               Broom pulls out a few old photos. Finds one of Grigory in 
               German uniform, and in a book, another of Grigory in an 
               Orthodox priest's black cassock.

               He pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from 
               it. His fingers scan the text, finding Rasputin's date of 
               birth, date of death. They pause at a particular line: "His 
               mausoleum is at SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16".

                                     BROOM
                         It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

               TCHK!! A noise -- Broom turns in time to see Kroenen 
               delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. In 
               spite of all his experience, Broom is shaken.

                                     BROOM
                         I see the puppet. But -- where is... 
                         the puppet master?

               In the dark, a voice hisses --

                                     GRIGORY
                         Very good, Professor Broom.

               Broom turns. Grigory steps from the shadows.

                         It was you: The scraps of paper,

                              (nods)
                         Bread crumbs on the trail. Like in a 
                         fable. They both distract him and 
                         guide him exactly where I need him.

                         His destiny.

               He touches Broom's forehead, lightly --

                                     GRIGORY
                         You raised the child. Nurtured him. 
                         So, In return... Would you permit 
                         me? A brief, brief glimpse? Of the 
                         future --

               FLASH!!

               A nightmarish tableau...

               EXT. RUINS OF N.Y. - DUSK

               The ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains 
               litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the 
               distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against 
               the blood-red sky.

               Dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons 
               and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His 
               horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly 
               fire.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Startled, Broom snaps out of it --

                                     GRIGORY
                         If only you had him destroyed sixty 
                         years ago, none of this would come 
                         to pass. But, then, how could you 
                         have known?

               Broom is speechless.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Your God chooses to remain silent. 
                         Mine lives within me.

               Rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving 
               and twitching beneath his human skin.

                                     GRIGORY
                         In the frozen waters of the Malaya 
                         Nevka, in the darkness of the void: 
                         every time I died and crossed over, 
                         a little more of the Master came 
                         back with me. He disclosed to me the 
                         child's true name... Would you like 
                         to know it??

                                     BROOM
                         I know what to call him. Nothing you 
                         can say or do will change that. I 
                         call him son.

               Discreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the 
               book. Kroenen settles in behind him.

                                     BROOM
                         I am ready.

                         Good. Now, I'll add two crumbs more:
                              (Kroenen displays his 
                              knives)
                         Grief and revenge...

               Kroenen's knife goes in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The pigeons flutter on the rooftop.

               The pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side.

                                     KID
                         Just go down there and tell her how 
                         you feel!
                              (Hellboy shakes his 
                              head: no)
                         My mom says --

                              (beat)
                         Plus, you're nine. You're not old 
                         enough to give me advice.

               Hellboy turns and sees --

               TWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner.

               Agent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers, 
               talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears.

                                     HELLBOY

               Agents and Bureau employees are crammed into Broom's office 
               doorway. Hellboy, face contorted by grief, pushes through.

               INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking 
               up evidence, etc. Tom Manning is there. Seeing Hellboy, he 
               respectfully steps back.

               Broom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. At his feet, 
               a pool of blood. Liz enters, then stifles a whimper.

               With tears in his eyes, a disbelieving Hellboy looks at Liz, 
               then at his dead father. He holds Broom's body close to his 
               chest.

                                     HELLBOY

                         back.

               Manning herds everybody out. From the door, Liz blinks back 
               tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost 
               master.

               The PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's 
               casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents.

               The hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away.

               Watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain 
               bounces off his wet overcoat.

               Liz observes him, worried.

                         Three decades and I've only gotten 
                         two sides.
                              (beat)
                         But I know this much: if there's 
                         trouble -- all we have is each other. 
                         And I'm stuck here.

                         We've collected and destroyed

               In a meeting room, Manning stands at a polished obsidian 
               desk. A group of agents -- Myers among them -- listens 
               attentively.

                         this freak show for good.

               Myers spots Liz walking past the conference room.

               INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - DUSK 

               Hellboy stands before Broom's desk, pensive, his naked chest 
               bandaged.

               Liz watches him from across the room. He finds Broom's rosary 
               on top of the book. Reads the underlined phrase on the page.

                                     LIZ
                         Hi --

               He turns to her. She slowly comes towards him.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hi.

                         I've changed my mind. I'll come to 
                         Moscow. If you -- are still going --

               Hellboy nods, then clears his throat.

                         about me. I do. What I am makes you

                         Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes 
                         you feel like you belong. And -- 
                         that's good. It really is. I -- wish

               EXT. MOSCOW WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Super: TOPOCKBA STEEL MILLS, MOSCOW A wasteland of rust and 
               decay. Rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel 
               watchdogs. No one's around but a few lonely sentries.

               A limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security 
               gates.

               INT. MOSCOW WAREHOUSE - DUSK

               A metal door trundles back and the limo and escort motorcycles  
               enter.

               Fleshy Russian General -- LAPIKOV -- gets out of the limo. 
               Then Ilsa and Grigory.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         I have accumulated many objects of 
                         great interest. Preserving our 
                         heritage.

               The warehouse contains a world of bric-a-brac: a towering 
               marble LENIN HEAD, Old Master paintings, tanks, warheads, 
               missiles, etc.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         Many -- like me -- believe Mother 
                         Russia to be very close to a historic 
                         rebirth.

               They stop before a cargo container. With a butane torch, a 
               soldier melts away the lead Kremlin seal, then open the doors.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Rebirth? I like that.

                         fell from the sky into Tungaska

                         June 30th, 1908. It burned hundreds 
                         of square miles of forest. The 
                         Romanovs took possession of it 
                         immediately. The Czar guarded it 
                         jealously -- I have wanted it for 
                         ages.

               Grigory's fingers brush over its smooth, perfect surface. At 
               the center --

               -- TWO CIRCULAR IMPRINTS that match Hellboy's four-fingered 
               stone hand.

                         Now, finally, it's mine.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         You are aware, of course, there's no 
                         way you'll get it out of Russian 
                         territory.

                              (curtly)
                         He is aware.

               Ilsa brings out a chrome box, full of gold.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         It's a pleasure doing business with 
                         you. Perhaps you have other interests.

               Grigory's voice drips with serene brutality.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Enjoy the bright metal you've earned. 
                         There will be no further transactions.

               cover and then jumps in.

               EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY

               -- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse 
               lies in a miserable black suit.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (whispers)
                         Animam edere, animus corpus...

               He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment, 
               nothing, and then...

               ...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters 
               something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

               EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY

               The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE 
               on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Sixty feet further, comrades, and 
                         three rows in...

               The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly 
               points, as if in confirmation.

                                     HELLBOY
                         This here is Ivan Klimentovich: Say 
                         "hi" Ivan.

               The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.

               EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY

               A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries 
               open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the 
               desiccated abomination on his back, walks in.

               OMIT

               INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY

               Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group 
               descends carefully. The walls are dotted with yellowed skulls.

               INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE

               Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life.

               INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION

               They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch 
               off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE 
               attop a pile of coffins.

                                     HELLBOY
                         We'll be alright... as long as we 
                         don't separate --

               INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY

               TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, 
               blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and 
               ramming Stone: he's gone.

               Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs 
               on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz 
               and Myers are on the other side.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (into his walkie-talkie)
                         Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn 
                         on your locators -- Anyone sees 
                         anything...

                                     LIZ
                         Marco...

                                     HELLBOY
                         ...Polo.

               On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from 
               Liz.

                                     MYERS
                              (into radio)
                         Are you sure about this?

                                     HELLBOY
                         On a scale of one to ten: two. But --
                              (beat)
                         -- she'll take care of you, Myers. 
                         She's a tough one.

               Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the 
               tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and 
               follows.

               INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs 
               crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down 
               the walls.

               Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal 
               structure.

               They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a 
               steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.

               Somewhere, a  massive clockwork is TICKING.

                                     MANNING
                         What's that --

               Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S 
               SOMETHING BIG"

               They stare into the darkness.

                                     MANNING
                         We should go back -- you -- you could 
                         tear that door apart --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't move. We --

                                     MANNING
                         -- should go back. Now!

                                     HELLBOY
                         No. Don't --

                                     MANNING
                         I'm in charge. We go back!

               Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic 
               metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the 
               bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the 
               CORPSE with it.

               Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Son of a --

               Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the 
               bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under 
               the door.

               Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his 
               feet.

               The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the 
               bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door --

               -- and makes it into the hexagonal building.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched 
               stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of 
               rusty steel blades.

               Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously 
               proceed...

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a 
               phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.

               Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.

                                     MANNING
                         Ouch!!

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself 
               up.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back 
               into the chamber --

               -- Kroenen is gone.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (to Manning)
                         Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach --

               Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.

               INT.  HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. 
               Manning moves along behind him.

               The record finishes playing. Silence --

               SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping 
               into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- 

               -- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen 
               bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate 
               blocks.

               Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw that.

               Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! 
               He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, 
               smashing its lenses.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You killed my father --

               BAMMM!!!! another hit.

               Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls 
               off.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Give your soul to God, Your ass is 
                         mine.

               An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is 
               laughing.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and 
               Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.

               Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but 
               a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's 
               hand, but loses his backpack.

               He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.

                                     MANNING
                              (panting, whispers)
                         Well, it's not that big a fall...

               KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot, 
               sparkling steel blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound.

               As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his 
               neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he 
               frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso. 
               MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand 
               over hand.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen goes to cut the rope...

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

                                     HELLBOY
                              (reaching the top)
                         Oh, no you don't --

               Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a 
               brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit!

               With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them 
               and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a 
               hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the 
               blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded 
               in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm, 
               slicing through his own ropy bicep.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You like playing possum, you Nazi 
                         pinhead?
                              (beat)
                         Then try playing dead.

               INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits 
               a horrid scream as it crushes him.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels 
               down.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up 
               his Zippo.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You'd better stay here. I'll find a 
                         way out. We'll come back for you.

                                     MANNING
                         You call that thing a cigar??

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yup.

                                     MANNING
                         You never, ever light a cigar that 
                         way.

               He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to 
               HELLBOY.

                                     MANNING
                         Use a wooden match. It preserves the 
                         flavor.

               He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.

                                     MANNING
                         Thank you.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY

               A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully.

               Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins 
               and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...

                                     MYERS
                         So, he thinks that you and I... That's 
                         why he's mad at me --

               A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders. 
               They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their 
               flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.

                                     MYERS
                         But it's not true, is it?

                         That you feel that way about me.

                         the same.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY

               Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for 
               handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.

               Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly 
               hear Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find 
               themselves calf-deep in brown water.

               Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.

                                     MYERS
                         Watch out. It's slippery...

               His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, my God...

               Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex 
               natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent 
               eggs.

               SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand 
               still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils 
               constrict. A snarl...

               A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself 
               off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.

               Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right 
               behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!

               Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up 
               the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers 
               falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.

                                     LIZ
                              (into the radio)
                         Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big 
                         Red butt over here!

               Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again 
               and again.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY

               Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!

               The rocks below him start to crumble.

               EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY

               In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, 
               pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures 
               move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three 
               times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with 
               pebbles.

               One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy 
               crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along 
               with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.

               Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels 
               are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two 
               new ones. Liz sprints to safety.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two 
                         alone.

               Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.

               Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One 
               clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy 
               howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a 
               zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.

               Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest 
               of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. 
               They're FIVE.

               Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. 
               A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy 
               is in trouble.

               Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her 
               body.

                                     LIZ
                              (at Myers)
                         Hit me.

                                     MYERS
                         What?

               Liz is desperate, crying.

                                     LIZ
                         Hit me --
                              (beat)
                         All of my life I've run away from 
                         it... Now I want it to happen! Do 
                         it.

               Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. 
               Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.

                                     MYERS
                         I can't, I --

               Liz slaps him.

                                     LIZ
                         I know now: I love him. I've always 
                         loved him.

               A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, 
               once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around 
               her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.

                                     LIZ
                         Go now.

               Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.

               The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.

               On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion 
               hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees 
               Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (weak)
                         Liz...

               The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of 
               fire expands.

               The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY

               The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...

               Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.

               Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. 
               The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He 
               stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried 
               in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, 
               on her side, unconscious.

               Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, 
               Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, 
               he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd 
               comedy.

               Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him 
               with a hammer --

               FADE OUT / FADE IN

               OMIT

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden 
               yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church-
               like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding 
               swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR 
               SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.

               Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on 
               the explosive belts.

               Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under 
               his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab 
               bought from Lapikov.

               Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial 
               robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, 
               he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.

                                     GRIGORY
                         "And I looked and beheld an Angel, 
                         and in his hand the key to the 
                         bottomless pit..."

               Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't 
               bend.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (gestures at the stone 
                              piece)
                         These were the words I heard as a 
                         peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the 
                         door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so 
                         that they might at long last enter 
                         our world.

                                     ILSA
                              (to Hellboy)
                         You are the key! The right hand of 
                         doom!

               Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --

                                     ILSA
                              (triumphant)
                         What did you think it was made for? 
                         Open the locks.

               Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first 
               time.

                                     MYERS
                         Don't do it!! Don't do it!!

               Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.

                                     ILSA
                         Silence!!

               The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. 
               The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.

                                     ILSA
                         Imagine it: An eden for you and her --

                                     HELLBOY
                         No.

               Grigory turns to Hellboy.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No?
                              (reasonable)
                         In exchange for her life then, open 
                         the door.

               In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.

                                     GRIGORY
                         As you wish.

               He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her 
               mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. 
               Then she goes limp.

                                     GRIGORY
                         She's dead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Noooo! Noooo!!!

               He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa 
               with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights 
               to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the 
               eclipse.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Her soul awaits on the other side. 
                         If you want her back...
                              (beat)
                         Open the door and claim her.

               His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. 
               Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed.

               He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         For her.

               Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. 
               It lands near Myers.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Names hold the power and nature of 
                         things. Mine for example. Rasputin: 
                         "The crossroads."
                              (beat)
                         And crossroads I have become.
                              (beat)
                         Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat 
                         it. Become the key.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Anung-un-Rama...

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the 
               stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of 
               his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a 
               winter's night.

               Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with 
               supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of 
               the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone 
               turns black as obsidian.

                                     MYERS
                         No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!

               HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on 
               the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock.

               A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.

               EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT

               Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! 
               The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's 
               more intense, with ripples and haloes.

               INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. 
               The ruby beam pierces the darkness.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: 
               a burning glyph.

               Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his 
               skin, but he manages to free one hand.

               EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs 
               uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the 
               frame.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He 
               turns it.

               Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --

               INT. THE SKY - NIGHT

               IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN 
               TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The final seal. Open it!

               Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn 
               it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers 
               her full in the face. She staggers back and down.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Remember who you are!!!

               He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy 
               catches it. It smokes in his hand.

               He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.

               Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint 
               of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.

               With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with 
               both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the 
               stumps.

               He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, 
               holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.

               The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers 
               and the connection with the moon is broken.

               Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. 
               The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.

               Grigory crumples in agony.

               The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his 
               features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You will never fulfill your destiny. 
                         You will never understand the power 
                         inside you.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I can live with that.

               He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers 
               stands by his side.

               He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down 
               the steps.

               Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed 
               GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Child...

               Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (dying)
                         Look what you've done --

               He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift 
               lazily.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You've killed me -- an insignificant 
                         man... but you have brought forth a 
                         God.

               He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out 
               of the wound, like intestines.

               A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the 
               air.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian 
                         of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.

               Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape --
               BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh 
               surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by 
               the second.

               Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the 
               mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.

                                     ILSA
                         Hell will hold no surprises for us.

               A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.

               INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT

               In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to 
               Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll 
                         deal with whatever's back there.

                                     MYERS
                         Alone?

                                     HELLBOY
                         How big can it be?

               As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, 
               reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash 
               onto HELLBOY´S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, 
               finally confronting --

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --

               Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the 
               tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.

               As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open. 
               Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to 
               grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.

               The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce 
               off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding 
               cogwheels and gears.

               Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble 
               statue.

               Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. 
               FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the 
               floor, rolling into the crack.

               From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles 
               replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's 
               face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.

               He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to 
               grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, 
               onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!

               The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide 
               away.

               A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, 
               he grabs the belts with his tail.

               The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens 
               in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever 
               seen.

               Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.

               The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.

                                     HELLBOY
                         They never work --

               He wraps them around his stone arm.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --

               He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him 
               into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.

               After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's 
               innards. Then --

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy 
               organs. The creature starts to burn.

               OMIT

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth 
               is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.

               Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!

               With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing 
               Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. 
               Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light 
               ripple over the ground.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ouch -- It did hurt.

               INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL

               Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully 
               drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.

               Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's 
               head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest 
               and whispers in her ear.

               A beat or two, then a moan.

                                     LIZ
                         In the dark -- I heard your voice -- 
                         What -- did you say -- ?

               He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "You, on the other side: let her go. 
                         Because for her, for her -- I'll 
                         die. I'll cross over."
                              (beat)
                         "And you'll be sorry I did."

               Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as 
               what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her 
               body.

               Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated 
               by the flames.

               Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom 
               Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
