	FADE IN:

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY

	CLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
	with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of
	the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
	sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
	the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.

	A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
	view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
	to his wound.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
	view, as they steer him away.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come on, Son --this is no place for us.

	YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of
	FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
	up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
	of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
	SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...

				P.A. SYSTEM
		Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at inmate number
		66578, Greely.

	INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT

				PRISON P.A. SYSTEM
		--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...

	COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
	of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
	corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.

	Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR
	FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
	ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS
	"REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE
	"DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.

	Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
	GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.

	COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...

				COLE
		Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on?

	JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is
	youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!

				JOSE
		"Volunteers" again.

	JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
	menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
	close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.

				SCARFACE
		"Volunteer duty".

    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.

				COLE
		I didn't volunteer.

				SCARFACE
		You causing trouble again?

				COLE
			(controls his temper)
		No trouble.

	INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
	in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.

			TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE

	COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		All openings must be closed.

	COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		If the integrity of the suit is compromised
		in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper
		not closed, readmittance will be denied.

	INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor,
	steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door
	clangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker
	now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.

	On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
	COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It

	INT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks
	down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.

	The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.

	INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

	COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through

	RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.

	The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.

	Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.

	EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

	A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
	aside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.

	COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in
	moonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people
	anywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.

	EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

	COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
	
	Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
	something.  Finds it.  An insect.

	COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it
	into a collection tube, something makes him turn.

	There's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.

	COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the
	light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.

	ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
	
	Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
	flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.

	INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked
	floor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!

	The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.

	Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More
	dogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!

	EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

	A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
	and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.

	Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
	buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.

	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

	COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large
	SPIDER tries to hide from the light.

	COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
	puts it into one of his specimen tubes.

	Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's
	nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.

	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN

	As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
	building.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.

	COLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
	logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is
	written, "WE DID IT!"

	COLE looks up.

	COLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION
	patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.

			TTTLES END

	INT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
	wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.

	INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
	long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
	FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their
	windowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,
	dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,

				AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)
		Raise your arms above your head.

	COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.

	INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
	in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws
	blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.

	COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick
	plastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
	behind the translucent aperture, studying him.

	The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.

	COLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...
	a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces
	heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with
	string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a
	dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering
	books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference
	table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,
	BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent
	a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,
	outdated, patched-together technologies.

				TINY
		James Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Thank you.  You two wait outside.

				SCARFACE
		He's got a history, Doctor.  Violence.

	COLE'S eyes return to the walls.

	Headlines:  "CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!"

				SCARFACE
		Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.

				ENGINEER
		I don't think he's going to hurt us.  You're
		not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?

	COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.

				COLE
		No, sir.

	The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.

	COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We want you to tell us about last
		night.

				COLE
		I went to the surface and I collected
		specimens like I was told.

	The SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully.

				COLE
			(worried)
		I mashed the spider, didn't I?

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		We'll get to the spider later, Mr.
		Cole.  Right now, we want to know
		everything that you saw.

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard
	sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.

				ASTPOPHYSICIST
		Where you collected sample #4, what
		street was that?

				COLE
		Uh...

				BOTANIST
		It's important to observe everything.

				COLE
		I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.

	As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,
	COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
	wall.  One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  Another features
	a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)
	and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Close your eyes, Cole.

	Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.

	BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.

				ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us in detail what you've seen in
		this room.

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, in this room?  Uh...

				MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		How many of us are there?

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Six...seven, if you count me.

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us about the pictures on the wall...

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, you mean the newspapers?

				A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)
		Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you
		hear my voice?  What do I look like?
		What does he look like, the man who
		just spoke?  How old were you when you
		left the surface?

	The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.
	SYSTEM at the airport.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY

	THE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked
	by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE
	land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse
	leading to the departure gates.

				P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)
		Flight 784 now boarding at gate...

	Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the
	monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn
	to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face
	averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago
	Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.

				MR. PONYTAIL
		WATCH IT!

	YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and
	the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.

	Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!"

	YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as
	TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others
	running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks
	up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....
	
				TERRIFIED TRAVELER
		Just exactly why did you volunteer?

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Wake up, Cole.

				COLE
		Uh, I didn't hear the...

				MICROBIOLOGIST
			(tapping a pencil on the table)
		I asked you, why did you volunteer?

				COLE
		Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me
		I volunteered.

	The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.

	COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as
	the ENGINEER speaks to him.

				ENGINEER
		We appreciate you volunteering.  You're
		a very good observer, Cole.

				COLE
		Uh, thank you.

				ENGINEER
		You'll get a reduction in sentence.

	COLE keeps his face impassive.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		To be determined by the proper authorities.

				ENGINEER
		You don't want to jeopardize that reduction,
		do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?

				COLE
		No, sir!

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We have a very advanced program, something
		very different, requires very skilled people.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		An opportunity to reduce your sentence
		considerably...

				ZOOLOGIST
		And possibly play an important role in
		returning the human race to the surface
		of the earth.

				ENGINEER
		We want tough minded people.  Strong
		mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes
		with "unstable" types.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		For a man in your position...an opportunity.

				BOTANIST
		Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
			(tapping his pencil again)
		Definitely a mistake!

	COLE gives away nothing.  He's in a box here.  He has no choices.
	He stares at the tapping pencil.

	INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHT

	A strikingly "real" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintings
	adorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his
	glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty
	seated on folding chairs.

				POET
		Still among the myriad microwaves, the
		infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones
		and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally
		small, byte-sized now, tinier even than
		science lurking in some vague electricity
		where, if we listen we can hear the solitary
		voice of that poet telling us,
		"We are no other than a moving row
		Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go
		Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold
		In Midnight by the Master of the show."

	As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE
	JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-
	eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  She's KATHRYN RAILLY.  And
	it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!

				POET'S VOICE (o.s.)
		"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
		Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit
		Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
		Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it."

	BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET
	looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the
	beeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,
	the glaring POET continues...

				POET
		"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;
		Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:
		Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:
		Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where."

	INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT

	DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.

				FRANKI
		-- so they get there and they ask the guy
		real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets
		agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
		Totally irrational, totally disoriented,
		doesn't know where he is, what day it is,
		alla that stuff.  All they got was his
		name.  They figure he's stoned out of
		his mind, it's some kinda psychotic
		episode, so they're gonna bring him...

				RAILLY
		He's been tested for drugs?

				FRANKI
		Negative for drugs.  But he took on
		five cops like he was dusted to the
		eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?

	FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed
	glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in
	strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded
	cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".

				RAILLY
		You have him in restraints.

				FRANKI
		Were you listening?  We got two officers in
		the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus
		the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill
		a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks
	right at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.

				RAILLY
		That would explain the bruises, I
		guess.  The struggle.

				FRANKI
		You want to go in?  Examine him?

				RAILLY
		Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...

				FRANKI
			(unlocking the door)
		James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None
		of the James Coles on the computer match him.
		No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.
		You want me to go in with you?

				RAILLY
			(entering)
		No, thank you.

				FRANKI
		I'll be right here...just in case.

	INT.  ISOLATION CELL

	COLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vivid
	colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...
	and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.

				RAILLY
		Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.
		I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the
		County -- I don't work for the police.
		My only concern is your well being --
		do you understand that?

				COLE
		I need to go now.

				RAILLY
		I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm
		not going to lie to you.  I can't make
		the police let you go...but I do want
		to help you.  And I want you to trust
		me.  Can you do that, James?  May I
		call you "James"?

				COLE
		"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.

				RAILLY
			(frowns, studies him)
		Have you been a patient at County?
		Have I seen you someplace?

				COLE
		No, not possible.  Listen, I have to
		get out of here.  I'm supposed to be
		getting information.

				RAILLY
		What kind of information?

				COLE
		It won't help you.  You can't do anything
		about it.  You can't change anything.

				RAILLY
		Change what?

				COLE
		I need to go.

				RAILLY
		Do you know why you're here, James.

				COLE
		Because I'm a good observer.  Because I
		have a tough mind.

				RAILLY
		I see.  You don't remember assaulting a
		police officer...several officers?

				COLE
		They wanted identification.  I don't have
		any identification.  I wasn't trying to
		hurt them.

				RAILLY
		You don't have a driver's license,
		James?  Or a Social Security card?

				COLE
		No.
	
				RAILLY
		Why not?  Most people have some ID.

				COLE
		You wouldn't understand.

				RAILLY
		You've been in an institution, haven't
		you, James?  A hospital?

				COLE
		I have to go.

				RAILLY
		A jail?  Prison?

				COLE
		Underground.

				RAILLY
		Hiding?

				COLE
		I love this air.  This is wonderful air.

				RAILLY
		What's wonderful about the air, James?

				COLE
		It's so clean.  No germs.

				RAILLY
		You're afraid of germs?

				COLE
		I have to go.

				RAILLY
		Why do you think there aren't any germs
		in the air, James?

				COLE
		This is April, right?

				RAILLY
		July.

				COLE
			(sudden panic)
		July?!

				RAILLY
		Do you know what year it is?

				COLE
		What year is it?

				RAILLY
		What year do you think it is?

				COLE
		1995?

				RAILLY
		You think it's July of 1995?  That's
		the future, James.  Do you think you're
		living in the future?

				COLE
			(slightly confused)
		No, 1995 is the past.

				RAILLY
		1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.

	COLE looks stunned.

	INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING

	COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his
	ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.

				COLE
		Where are you taking me?

				POLICEMAN #1
		South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.
		You're gonna love it.

				COLE
		South of France?!  I don't want to go
		to the South of France.  I want to make
		a telephone call.

	POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.

				POLICEMAN #2
		Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink
		with your act, but you don't fool us.

	Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight
	overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.

	EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY

	A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
	prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department
	logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.

	INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)

	Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLE
	stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,
	PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.

	As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and
	starts inspecting his scalp...

				BILLINGS
		Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you
		got any creepy crawlies.

				COLE
		I need to make a telephone call.

				BILLINGS
			(pulling Cole's head)
		Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.
		Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.

				COLE
		It's very important.

				BILLINGS
		What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it
		easy, relax into things.  We all gonna
		get along fine if you just relax.

	COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the
	lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.

	INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)

	COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the
	large room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where
	light pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON
	COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.

	PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily
	at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.

	BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,
	a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.

				BILLINGS
		Jeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.
		Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV
		rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?

				JEFFREY
			(with a sly look)
		How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd
		be doing your job.

				BILLINGS
		Five thousand dollars, my man.  That
		enough?  I'll wire it to your account
		as usual, okay?

				JEFFREY
		Okay, Billings.  Five thousand.  That's
		enough.  Five thousand dollars.  I'll
		give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.

	As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.

				JEFFREY
		Kid around, kid around.  It makes them feel
		good, we're all pals.  We're prisoners, they're
		the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?

	COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are
	playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.

				JEFFREY
		Here's the games.  Games vegitize you.
		If you play the games, you're
		voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.

	COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,
	THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.

				JEFFREY
		What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How
		much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.

				COLE
		I need to make a telephone call.

				JEFFREY
		A telephone call?  That's communication
		with the outside world!  Doctor's
		discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts
		could just make phone calls, it could
		spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone
		cables, oozing into the ears of all those
		poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos
		everywhere!  A plague of madness.
			(suddenly sly and confidential)
		In fact, very few of us here are actually
		mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're
		not mentally ill, for all I know you're
		crazy as a loon.  But that's not why
		you're here.  Why you're here is because
		of the system, because of the economy.
			(indicating the TV)
		There's the TV.  It's all right there.
		Commercials.  We are not productive
		anymore, they don't need us to make
		things anymore, it's all automated.  What
		are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay,
		buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
		But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you
		know what?  You're mentally ill! That's
		a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet
		paper, new cars, computerized blenders,
		electrically operated sexual devices...
			(getting hysterical)
		SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN
		RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH
		BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-
		ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...

	A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.

				TERRY
		Take it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.

	Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and
	continues, completely calm now.  But COLE isn't listening.  He's
	mesmerized by the TV.

				JEFFREY
		So if you want to watch a particular
		program, say "All My Children" or
		something, you go to the Charge Nurse
		and tell her what day and time the show
		you want to see is on.  But you have to
		tell her before the show is scheduled
		to be on.  There was this one guy who
		was always requesting shows that had already
		played.  He couldn't quite grasp the
		idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't
		just make it be yesterday for him, turn
		back time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!

	This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and
	he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.

				JEFFREY
		Seriously, more and more people are
		being defined now as mentally ill.  Why?
		Because they're not consuming on their
		own.  But as patients, they becone
		consumers of mental health care.  And
		this gives the so-called sane people work!
			(hysteria again)
		WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!
		HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!
		IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THE
		SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...

				TERRY
		Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna
		get a shot.  I warned you...

				JEFFREY
			(calming himself, smiling)
		Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.
		I got "carried away".  Explaining the
		workings of...the institution.

	Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a
	bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.

				TJ WASHINGTON
		I don't really come from outer space.

				JEFFREY
		This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he
		doesn't really come from outer space.

				TJ WASHINGTON
		Don't mock me, my friend.
			(to Cole)
		It's a condition of "mental divergence".
		I find myself on another planet, Ogo,
		part of an intellectual elite, preparing
		to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.
		But even though it's a totally convincing
		reality in every way...I can feel, breathe,
		hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a
		construct of my psyche.  I am mentally
		divergent in that I am escaping certain
		unnamed realities that plague my life
		here.  When I stop going there, I will
		be well.  Are you also divergent, friend?

	The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.

				P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)
		James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!

				JEFFREY
		Staff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now the
		geniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!

	INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

	COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.

				COLE
		This is a place for crazy people!  I'm
		not crazy!

	RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best
	friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit
	around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing
	the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  (Some of the DOCTORS
	bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)

				RESIDENT #1
		We don't use that term..."crazy", Mr. Cole.

				COLE
		Well, you've got some real nuts in here!
		Listen to me, all of you -- I have to
		tell you something that's going to be
		difficult for you to understand, but...

				DR. RAILLY
		James...please.  These are all doctors
		here and we want to help you.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr.
		Railly you thought it was...
			(checking a file)
		1995. ... How about right now?  Do you
		know what year it is right now?

				COLE
		1989.  Look, I'm not confused.  There's been
		a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.

	Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE
	is just grabbing a pad and pencil.

				COLE
		Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.

	FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.

				COLE
			(drawing)
		Do any of you know anything about the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paint
		this, stencil it, on buildings, all
		over the place.

	COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.

				DR. CASEY
		Mr. Cole...

				COLE
		Right.  I guess you wouldn't, this is
		1989, they're probably not active yet.
		That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,
		three billion people died in 1995.
		Three billion, got that?  Almost
		the whole population.  Of the world!
		Only about one percent survived.

	DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.

				RESIDENT #2
		Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?

				COLE
		Save you?  How can I save you?  It
		already happened!  I can't save you.  I'm
		simply trying to get some information for
		people in the present so that someday...
			(sees their eyes)
		You don't believe me.  You think I'm
		crazy.  But I'm not crazy.  I'm a convict,
		sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as
		sane as anyone in this room.  I...

	COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLE'S seen
	that tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.

				DR. RAILLY
		Can you tell us the name of the prison
		you've come from?

	COLE doesn't answer.  He's staring at the tapping pencil.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?

				COLE
			(recovering, new tack)
		No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I
		need to do is make a telephone call to
		straighten everything out.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would
		straighten everything out?

				COLE
		Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in
		to them.  They'll want to know they
		sent me to the wrong time.

				DR. FLETCHER
		So you could talk to these scientists
		and they do what?  Send you to the future?

				COLE
		No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called,
		"voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages.
		They monitor it from the present.

				RESIDENT #2
		"From the present."  We're not in the
		present now, Mr. Cole?

				COLE
		No, no.  This is the past.  This has
		already happened.  Listen...

				RESIDENT #3
		Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's
		the present, is that it?

				COLE
		No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...

				DR. FLETCHER
		These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they
		doctors like ourselves?

	Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.

				COLE
		No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given
		a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid.
		You have to let me use the phone.  One call!

	COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.

	INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY

	Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS
	insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER
	lunges for the phone, answers sharply...

				MOTHER
		Yes?
			(listens, frowns, then)
		Whaaaaat?  "Voice mail"!  I don't know
		what you're talkin' about. ... Is this
		a joke?  I don't know any scientists.
		James who?  Never heard of you!

	The MOTHER slams down the phone.

	INT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY

	A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically,
	RAILLY takes it from him.

				RAILLY
		It wasn't who you expected?

	COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts?

				COLE
		It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.

				RAILLY
		Perhaps it was a wrong number...

				COLE
		No.  That's the reason they chose me --
		I remember things.

	RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.
	It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool,
	detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.

				RAILLY
		James, where did you grow up?  Was it
		around here?  Around Baltimore?

				COLE
			(lost in thought)
		What?

				RAILLY
		I have the...strangest feeling I've met
		you before...a long time ago, perhaps.
		Were you ever...?

				COLE
		Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed
		to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's
		not the right number yet.  That's the
		problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?

	RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,
	pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.

				RAILLY
		James, take these.
			(watching him step back)
		Please -- I helped you like I said I
		would.  Now I want you to trust me.

	INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)

	MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.

				MR. PONYTAIL
		WATCH IT!

	Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It was
	definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE.

	TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out...

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		NOOOOOOOOOO!

	The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but
	doesn't speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!

	Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It's
	the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  He's
	sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his
	moustache slightly askew!

	A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.
	Everything goes white!

	INT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.

	He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.
	Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,
	occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of
	an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.

	His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.

	He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.

	With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of
	bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.

	COLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single
	tree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.

	ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It won't work. You can't open it.

	Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.

				JEFFREY
		You think you can remove the grill but
		you can't.  It's welded.

	COLE checks the grill anyway.

				JEFFREY
		See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are
		locked, too.  They're protecting the
		people on the outside from us.  But the
		people outside are as crazy as us.

	COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along
	the window sill.  He's staring at it when he's distracted by a
	sudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed
	just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with
	the blade of his flashlight.

	ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.

	The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.

	For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,
	SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse
	whisper, picking up right where he left off.

				JEFFREY
		You know what "crazy" is?  "crazy" is
		"majority rules".  Take germs for example.

	Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get
	out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!

				COLE
		Germs?!

				JEFFREY
		In the 18th century there was no such
		thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a
		thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along
		comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I
		think.  He tries to convince people...
		other doctors mostly...that there are
		these teeny tiny invisible "bad things"
		called germs that get into your body and
		make you...sick!  He's trying to get
		doctors to wash their hands.  What is
		this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible
		whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!

	As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to
	figure out where to put the SPIDER.

				JEFFREY (cont.)
		So cut to the 20th century!  Last week
		in fact, right before I got dragged
		into this hellhole.  I order a burger
		in this fast food joint.  The waiter
		drops it on the floor.  He picks it up,
		wipes it off, hands it to me...like it
		was all okay.

	No alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows
	it as JEFFREY prattles on...

				JEFFREY
		"What about the germs?"  I say.  He
		goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs
		are just a plot they made up so they
		can sell you disinfectants and soap!"
		Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you
		believe in germs, don't you?

				COLE
		I'm not crazy.

				JEFFREY
		Of course not, I never thought you were.
		You want to escape, right?  That's very
		sane.  I can help you.  You want me to,
		don't you?  Get you out?

				COLE
		If you know how to escape, why don't you...?

				JEFFREY
		Why don't I escape, that's what you
		were going to ask me, right?  'Cause
		I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken
		care of, see?  I've sent out word.

				COLE
		What's that mean?

				JEFFREY
		I've managed to contact certain underlings,
		evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and
		assorted minions, who will contact my father.
		When he learns I'm in this kind of place,
		he'll have them transfer me to one of those
		classy joints where they treat you...properly.
		LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS!
		TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS
		FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...

	PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the
	dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself.

				JEFFREY
		Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little
		agitated.  The thought of escaping
		crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly
		I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS
		BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW
		FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING
		THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...

	COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.

				JEFFREY
		You dumb assholes!  I'm a mental patient!
		I'm supposed to act out.  Wait til you
		morons find out who I am.  My father's
		gonna be really upset.  AND WHEN MY
		FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES!
		MY FATHER IS GOD!  I WORSHIP MY FATHER.

	INT.  WARD DAYROOM - MORNING

	ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing
	pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached
	to his tiny, restrained body.

	ANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with
	crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty
	robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Torture!  Experiments!  We're all
		monkeys

	COLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes
	the seat next to him.

				COLE
		They hurt you!

				JEFFREY
		Not as bad as what they're doing to
		kitty.

	ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles,
	eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates.

				TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.)
		These video tapes were obtained by
		animal rights activists who worked
		underground as laboratory assistants
		for several months.  Authorities say
		there is little they can do until...

	The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of
	their experiments passively.

	ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.

				COLE
		Look at those assholes, they're asking
		for it!  Maybe people deserved to be
		wiped out!

				JEFFREY
			(startled, turning)
		Wiping cut the human race!  That's a
		great idea!  But it's more of a long
		term thing -- right now we have to
		focus on more immediate goals.
			(sudden whisper)
		I didn't say a word about "you know
		what".

				COLE
		What are you talking about???

				JEFFREY
		You know -- your plan.

	As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine.

				JEFFREY
		What're you writing?  You a reporter?

				COLE
			(shielding the magazine)
		It's private.

				JEFFREY
		A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?

	Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills.

				BILLINGS
		Yo, James -- time to take your meds.

	INT.  DAY ROOM/HOSPITAL - THIRTY MINUTES LATER (MORNING)

	ANGLE ON THE TV, a commercial playing:  a beautiful couple romps
	in the surf in slow motion while an eager NARRATOR encourages...

				NARRATOR (v.o.)
		Take a chance.  Live the moment.  Sunshine.
		Gorgeous beaches.  The Florida Keys!

	ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with
	other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen.

	ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers.

				TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.)
		We'll return to the Marx Brothers in
		"Monkey Business" following these
		messages.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Monkey Business!  Monk Key Business.

	COLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking.
	
				JEFFREY
		Get it?  Monk - Key.  Monk!
			(big grin)
		Key!

	JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment.  A KEY!

				COLE
			(groggy)
		What....???

				JEFFREY
		Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro.
		Major load!  Listen up -- try and get
		it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan!
		Remember?  I did my part.

				COLE
		What...???

				JEFFREY
		Not, "what", babe!  When!

		"When???"

				JEFFREY
			(pressing the key into Cole's hand)
		Now!

				VOICE/TV (o.s.)
		Let us guide you to the stocks and
		bonds that will enhance your portfolio.

				JEFFREY
			(leaping to his feet)
		YES -- NOW!  BUY NOW!  STOCKS AND BONDS!
		NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW.

	ANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a
	BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating.

				VOICE/TV (v.o.)
		A portfolio tailored to your specific
		needs and the needs of your loved ones...

	ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily.

				JEFFREY
		YES, YES.  ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!

	ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go
	of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a
	beeper, calling for help.

	ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room.

				JEFFREY
		BUY!  SELL!  SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!

	ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE
	KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE.  Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the
	puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just
	completed the puzzle stares, very upset.

	Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a
	lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.

				HEAVY WOMAN PATIENT
		I'M GETTING DIZZY.  MAKE HIM STOP!

				SKINNY MAN PATIENT
		HERE THEY COME!  THEY'RE COMING!

				OLD MAN PATIENT
		FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I GOT FIVE
		HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I'M INSURED!

				JEFFREY
		OPPORTUNITY!  DEFINITELY!  A WINDOW OF
		OPPORTUNITY!  OPENING NOW!  NOW'S THE TIME
		FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT!  YES!
		YES!  MASTERCARD!  VISA!  THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!

	ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY
	is sending a message to him.  COLE looks at the ward door.

	COLE'S POV:  the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter.
	One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached
	to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.

				JEFFREY
		SEIZE THE MOMENT!  GET RICH!  NOW'S THE
		TIME!  GO FOR IT!

				BILLINGS
			(missing a tackle)
		God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.

	ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating.  He locks at the door...blurring in
	and out of focus.  He looks down at the key in his hand.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREY
	resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.

				JEFFREY
		LAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW!

	ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries to
	insert the key in the lock.

	ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.

	ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.

	COLE'S POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE.

	ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It won't turn.

	A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.

				PATIENT
		Place to go would be...Florida.  The
		keys are lovely this tine of year.

	COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again.  It turns.

				PATIENT
		Be careful.  J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead.

	COLE pauses, stares, not understanding.  Then, he opens the door.

	INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL

	Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room
	facing several elevators.

	A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn't even
	lock up from the magazine he's reading.

	Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his
	back is to the SECURITY MAN.  But he doesn't know how to control
	this elevator.  What should he do?

				SECURITY MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Two's not working today.  Use one.

	COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.

	COLE'S POV:  the SECURITY MAN continues his reading.  He's a big
	guy with reading glasses perched on his nose.  He looks exactly
	like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!

	ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!

	Just then, an elevator door slides open.  The elevator's empty.

	COLE steps into it.

	INT.  ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL

	The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.

	COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator
	springs to life.  The numbers on the indicator over the door
	start to rise.  7...8...9.

	Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.

	Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.

	COLE hesitates.

	They look at him.  They seem to expect him to exit.

	Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.

	As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.

	INT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE - MORNING

	RAILLY has just arrived for work.  She's slipping on her white
	doctor's coat when...

	DR. CASEY, one of the other residents, sticks his head in the
	door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine.

				DR. CASEY
		This was in my box, but I have a slight
		suspicion it wasn't meant for me.

	CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.

				DR. CASEY
		"You are the most beautiful woman I have
		ever seen.  You live in a beautiful
		world.  But you don't know it.  You have
		freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe."

				RAILLY
			(smiling)
		Cole.  James Cole -- right?

	She reaches for the note but CASEY moves it out of her grasp.

				DR. CASEY
		"I would do anything to stay here, but
		I must leave.  Please, help me."

				RAILLY
		Poor man...

	CASEY is handing her the note when another resident, DR. GOODINS,
	sticks his head in the door.  He's upset.

				DR. GOODINS
		Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of
		yours, right?

	RAILLY and CASEY stare at him.

				DR. GOODINS
		He got out.  Took off.  Last seen, he
		was up on nine.

    INT.  X-RAY DEPARTMENT/BASEMENT - DAY

    A PATIENT is being swallowed by a large tube, a CAT SCANNER,
    while a DOCTOR in a white coat speaks reassuringly.

				DOCTOR
		Just relax -- don't fight it.  We have
		to know exactly what's there so we can...

	The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open.

	It's COLE!  He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner.

	The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.

				DOCTOR
		Eh, excuse me.  Can I help you?

	COLE turns and rushes back out the door.

	INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL

	COLE steps into the corridor, turns to his right, freezes.

	A POSSE of SECURITY GUARDS is headed in his direction.

	COLE turns to his left.

	Four ORDERLIES are coming that way.

	COLE'S trapped.  A beat.  He attacks the nearest man.  BILLINGS.

	INT.  TECH ROOM/PSYCH WARD - SHORTLY (DAY)

	RAILLY prepares a hypo, turns to COLE who is strapped tightly on
	a gurney with BILLINGS and an RN standing on either side, tense
	for more trouble.  One of BILLINGS' eyes is starting to swell shut.

				RAILLY
		It's just a shot to calm you.

				COLE
		No more drugs.  Please...

				RAILLY
		I have to do this, James.  You're very
		confused.

	RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin.

	INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY)

	DR. FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table.  DR.
	CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't
		an inquisition.

				RAILLY
		I didn't think I was being defensive.
		I was just...

				DR. FLETCHER
		He should have been in restraints.  It
		was bad judgment on your part, plain
		and simple.  why not just cop to it?

				RAILLY
		Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have
		the strangest feeling about him -- I've
		seen him somewhere and...

				DR. FLETCHER
			(impatient, not interested)
		Two policemen were already in the
		hospital and now we have an orderly
		with a broken arm and a Security
		Officer with a fractured skull.

				RAILLY
		I said it was bad judgment!  What else
		do you want me to say?

				DR. FLETCHER
		You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.
			(to Dr. Casey)
		Isn't she being defensive, Bob?

	But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.

				BILLINGS
		Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another...
		situation.

	INT.  CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

	DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN,
	GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.

				DR. FLETCHER
		He was in full restraints?  And the
		door was locked?

				BILLINGS
		Yes, sir.  Did it myself.

				DR. FLETCHER
		And he was fully sedated?

				RAILLY
		He was fully sedated!

				DR. FLETCHER
		Then are you trying to tell me that a
		fully sedated, fully restrained patient
		somehow slipped out that vent, replaced
		the grill behind him and that he's wriggling
		through the ventilation system right now?

	DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)

	Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into
	the sky as the airport P.A. System drones...

				P.A. SYSTEM
		Flight 784 to San Francisco now
		boarding at Gate 38...

	YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION.

	MR. PONYTAIL bumps him.

	The BLONDE MAN sprints past.  The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out!

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		NOOOOOOOOOO!

	TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE
	running after the BLONDE MAN!  But this time, YOUNG COLE catches
	just a glimpse of her face.  She looks a little like RAILLY except
	for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings.  She
	calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM...

				BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM
		The Freedom For Animals Headquarters
		now boarding on Second Avenue.  The
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

				ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Cole, you moron -- wake up!

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE

	As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM
	continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE...

				UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM
		-- they're the ones who are going to do it...

	COLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table
	in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him.  It's
	a beat-up old tape recorder.

				UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER
		I can't do anything more.  The Police
		are after me.

	The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Well?

				COLE
		Uh, what?

				ENGINEER
		He's drugged out of his mind!  He's
		completely zoned out.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Cole, did you or did you not record
		that message?

				COLE
		Uh, that message...me?

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		It's a digital reconstruction of a
		message, Cole, from a weak signal on our
		contact number.  Did you make that call?

				COLE
			(angrily)
		I couldn't call!  You sent me to the
		wrong year!  It was 1989.

				SCIENTISTS
		1989!

	The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers.  Then,

				ZOOLOGIST
		You're certain of that?

				GEOLOGIST
			(before Cole can answer)
		What did you do with your time, Cole?
		Did you waste it on drugs?  Women?

				COLE
		They forced me to take drugs.

				BOTANIST
		Forced you!  Why would someone force
		you to take drugs?

				COLE
		I got into trouble.  I got arrested.
		But I still got you a specimen -- a
		spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to
		put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong
		year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.

	The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing
	looks, huddle, start whispering to one another.

	Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST
	staring at COLE intently.  For one moment, the face belongs to
	DR. FLETCHER!

	COLE blinks hard...and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again.

	COLE'S head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.

				GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Cole!

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE

	COLE comes awake with a start.  The room is dark now, except...

	a slide is being projected on a torn screen.  It's a picture of a
	stenciled graffiti...the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

				ENGINEER
		What about it, Cole?

				ZOOLOGIST
		Did you see it?

				COLE
		Uh, no, sir.  I...

	Another slide CLICKS into place.  Youthful PROTESTERS, their
	placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities,
	confront POLICE in riot gear.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		What about these people?  Did you see
		any of these people?

	Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the
	PROTESTERS.  The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will
	recognize some of them later on).

				COLE (o.s.)
		Uh, no, sir, I...wait!

	The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the
	PROTESTERS.  In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage
	is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Him?  You saw that man?

				COLE
		Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.

				MICRO3IOLOGIST
			(switching on the light)
		You were in a mental institution?!

	The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		You were sent to make very important
		observations!

				BOTANIST
		You could have made a real contribution.

				GEOLOGIST
		Helped to reclaim the planet...

				ZOOLOGIST
		As well as reducing your sentence.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		The question is, Cole -- "Do you want
		another chance?"

	COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)

	The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as
	frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey!  Who's that?

	INT.  CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE opens his eyes.  Where is he?  Silence as he examines the
	tiny cell.  Bare cement walls.  High ceiling.  Same color and
	size as the isolation room at the county hospital.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey, Bob...what's your name?

	COLE looks around frantically.  Up, down.  Where is the VOICE
	coming from?  Maybe from that tiny vent high in the wall...

				COLE
		Where are you?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You can talk!  Wah'dja do, Bobby boy?
		Volunteer?

				COLE
		My name's not "Bob".

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Not a prob, Bob.  Where'd they send you?

				COLE
		Where are you?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Another cell. ...  Maybe.

				COLE
		What do you mean, "maybe"?  What's that
		supposed to mean?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Maybe.  Means "maybe" I'm in the next cell,
		another "volunteer" like you -- or "maybe"
		I'm in the Central Office spying on you
		for all those science bozos.  Or, hey, "maybe"
		I'm not even here.  "Maybe" I'm just in
		your head.  No way to confirm anything.
		Ha Ha.  Where'd they send you?

	COLE doesn't answer.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Not talking, huh, Bob?  That's okay
		I can handle that.

				COLE
		1989.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		89!  How was it?  Good drugs?  Lotsa
		pussy?  Hey, Bob, you do the job?  D'ju
		find out the "big info"?...Army of the
		Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was
		prior to mutation?

				COLE
		It was supposed to be 1995.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Science isn't an exact science with
		these clowns.  You're lucky you didn't
		end up in ancient Egypt!

	INT.  LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE

	COLE is strapped on a gurney.  SCIENTISTS hover near-by,
	whispering.  The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.

				GEOLOGIST
		No mistakes this time, Cole.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Stay alert.  Keep your eyes open.

				ZOOLOGIST
		Good thinking about that spider, Cole.
		Try and do something like that again.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Just relax now -- don't fight it.  We
		have to know exactly what's there so we
		can fix it.

	The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube...
	reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital.

	COLE'S POV:  a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber
	door is CLANGED shut.

	EVERYTHING IS BLACK.  A HUM BUILDS.  THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE
	HUM REACHES A DEAFENING LEVEL, THEN DIMUENDOS.  WE BEGIN TO HEAR
	BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE, VOICES SHOUTING IN FRENCH, A SUDDEN
	HUGE EXPLOSION!  THEN...

	EXT.  TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY

	DRIZZLING RAIN.  And SCREAMS.  COLE'S in a deep trench, naked,
	eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he?  SOLDIERS
	in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured
	COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit
	fifteen yards away.  Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks...
	in FRENCH.  COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I!
	Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.

				SERGEANT
			(FRENCH, subtitled)
		Where's your mask?!  And your clothes...
		and your weapon, you idiot?!

				COLE
		What?  What??

	COLE looks around desperately.  A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being
	stretchered past them in the narrow trench.  Machine guns chatter
	close at hand.  AAK AAK AAK.  A grenade EXPLODES.  Reacting to the
	foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs...

				SERGEANT
			(FRENCH, subtitled)
		Captain!  A Kraut!  We got a Kraut!

				COLE
		I don't understand.  Where am I?

	The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.

				CAPTAIN
			(GERMAN, subtitled)
		How'd you get here, soldier?  What's
		your rank?  Where are your clothes?

				COLE
		I...don't understand.

				CAPTAIN
			(frowning, GERMAN, subtitled)
		German!  Speak German!  What are you
		doing here?

				VOICE (o.s.)
			(pleading in English)
		I gotta find 'em.  I gotta find 'em.
		Please, you gotta help me!

	COLE turns, sees...

	It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in
	the "underground" time.  He's being carried past COLE now on a
	stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.

				COLE
		JOSE!

				JOSE
		Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?

	JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH
	PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.  SUDDENLY,
	SHOTS RING OUT.  COLE goes down.  Hit in the leg!

	SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.

	Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead
	from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.

	COLE is reaching for the mask when...

	A SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.

	EXT.  COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

	Stunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at the
	dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.  MOVING IN we FOCUS ON
	a large poster advertising "The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995".
	WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew
	Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON...

				DR. KATHRYN RAILLY
			MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS
					MAY 17

	INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT

	A large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen is
	a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in
	apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained
	by PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE
	of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		According to the accounts of local
		officials at that time, this gentleman,
		judged to be about forty years of age,
		appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle
		near Stonehenge in the West of England in
		April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and
		speaking in a strange accent, the man made
		dire prognostications about a pestilence
		which he predicted would wipe out humanity
		in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and
		hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the
		village, was taken into custody, but then
		mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.

	WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern
	in a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the
	engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
	scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an
	audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.

					RAILLY (cont.)
		In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons
		of great pestilence, men have often
		believed the prophecies of crazed
		fanatics, that the end of the world was
		come."  Obviously, this plague/doomsday
		scenario is considerably more compelling
		when reality supports it in some form,
		whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,
		or AIDS.  In addition to these "natural"
		contagions, there are now technological
		horrors as well:  besides radiation,
		consider our lurking fear of germ
		warfare and its close approximation,
		chemical warfare, which first reared
		its ugly head in the deadly mustard
		gas attacks during the First World War.

	ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I
	SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		During such an attack in the French
		trenches in October, 1917, we have an
		account of this soldier...

	ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
	JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried
	by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears
	to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until
	the image approximates Munch's famous painting.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)
		-- who, during an assault, was wounded
		by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
		lines where Doctors discovered he had
		lost all comprehension of French but
		spoke English fluently, albeit in a
		regional dialect they didn't recognize.
		The man, although physically unaffected
		by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed
		he had come from the future, that he was
		looking for a pure germ that would
		ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
		the earth in the year... 1995!

	The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.

	ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time
	he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		Although seriously injured, the young
		soldier disappeared from the hospital
		before more data could be gathered.  No
		doubt, he was trying to carry on his
		mission to warn others, substituting
		for the agony of war...a self-inflicted
		agony we call the "Cassandra Complex".

	As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,
	RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening
	attentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with
	shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.

				RAILLY (cont.)
		Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,
		was condemned to know the future but to be
		disbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,
		the agony of foreknowledge combined with
		impotence to do anything about it.

	INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)

	A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, Apocalyptic
	Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn Railly

	Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY is
	seated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.

				DR. PETERS
		I think, Dr. Railly, you have given
		your alarmists a bad name.  Surely
		there is very real and very convincing
		data that the planet cannot survive the
		excesses of the human race:  proliferation
		of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding
		habits, the rape of the environment, the
		pollution of land, sea, and air.  In this
		context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken
		Little" represents the sane vision and
		that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go
		shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?

	DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly
	disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.
 
				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
		Doctor Railly -- please!  I wonder if
		you're aware of my own studies which
		indicate that certain cycles of the
		moon actually impact on the incidence
		of apocalyptic predictions as observed
		in urban emergency rooms and...

	As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE
	CHANG, appear and whisper...

				MARILOU
		You were great.

				RAILLY
		You're leaving?

				MARILOU
		The reservation's at nine thirty --
		it's getting late.

				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
		Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very
		important!

				WAYNE CHANG
			(checking the professor)
		You sure you're gonna be all right?

				RAILLY
			(smiles, checks her watch)
		I'll be there in twenty minutes.

				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
		Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand
		your exclusion of the moon in relation
		to apocalyptic dementia...

	EXT.  PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT

	A full moon.

	COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,
	"Congratulations" to RAILLY.

	She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last
	cars left in the lot.

	The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.

	RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
	purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...

	Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large
	shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Get in!

	Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the
	front seat.

				MAN'S VOICE
		I've got a gun.

	RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and
	scrambles in behind her.

	INT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT

	Fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice, RAILLY says...

				RAILLY
		You can have my purse.  I have a lot of
		cash and credit...

				MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Start the car.

	Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes
	peering out of the shadows, no other features.

	Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.

				RAILLY
		Here!  You can have the keys.  You can...

	He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely
	into her ear, his face last in shadow.

				MAN
		START THE CAR!  NOW!

	EXT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT

	The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.

	INT.  ACURA

	Steering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.

				MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		I don't want to hurt you.  But I will.
		I've hurt people before when...when I
		had no choice.  Turn left.

	As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,
	sees him unfolding a tattered map.  His face is lost in darkness
	but she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read the
	map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.

				RAILLY
		Where... where are we going'

				MAN
		I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.

				RAILLY
			(startled, horrified)
		But that's... that's more than 200 miles!

				MAN
		That's why I can't walk there.  Turn
		here... I think...

	RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then
	boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully
	for his reaction.

	He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirror
	again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features
	are concealed by the map.

				RAILLY
		If you make me go with you, it's
		kidnapping.  That's a serious crime.
		If you let me go, you could just take
		the car and...

				MAN
		I don't know how to drive!  We went
		underground when I was nine, I told you
		that.  When you come to the corner,
		turn right.

	Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.

	He's lowered the map.  It's COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty.

				RAILLY
		Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a
		locked room six years ago.

				COLE
		1989.  Six years for you.  There's the
		sign!  Right here!

	COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.

	RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.

	EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT

	The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.

	INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT

	RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily
	against the seat.  She says carefully...

				RAILLY
		I can't believe this is a coincidence,
		Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?

				COLE
		You told me you'd help me.  I know this
		isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate...
		no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.
		I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that.
		But then I saw your book in a store window
		with a notice about your lecture.
			(sudden pride)
		I can read, remember?

				RAILLY
		Yes, I remember.
			(a beat, then)
		Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?

				COLE
		It's the next step.  I checked out the
		Baltimore information, it was nothing.
		It's Philadelphia, that's where they
		are, the ones who killed everyone.
			(pointing suddenly, eagerly)
		Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?

	RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF
	and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.

				COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)
		This is a personal message to you.

	COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.

				COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		Are you at the end of your rope?  Are
		you dying to get away?

	COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.

				COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}
		The Florida Keys are waiting for you.

	COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills
	the car.  It's confusing!  He blurts out...

				COLE
		I've never seen the ocean!

	Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her
	professional tone.

				RAILLY
		It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You
		do understand that, don't you?  It's
		not really a special message to you.

	COLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but she's probably right.

				COLE
		You used to call me "James".

				RAILLY
		You'd prefer that? ... James...you
		don't really have a gun, do you.

				COLE
			(cynical laugh)
		Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...

	He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC!  FATS DOMINO singing
	"BLUEBERRY HILL"!  COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.

				COLE
		Can you...can you make it louder?  I
		love hearing twentieth century music!
		Hearing music and breathing air!

	As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror
	incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the
	wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily.

	EXT.  FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT

	"BLUEBERRY HILL" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear
	window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.

	The sign says, "PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES."

	INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT

	RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his
	head out the window.  what can she do?  Just then, while she's
	trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in...

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
		This just in from Fresno, California:
		emergency crews are converging on a
		cornfield where playmates of nine year
		old Ricky Neuman say they saw him
		disappear right before their eyes.

	COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now.

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		Young Neuman apparently stepped into an
		abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere
		in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive,
		possibly seriously injured.  Playmates claim
		they heard him cry out faintly but since then
		there has been no contact with...

				COLE
		"Never cry wolf!"

				RAILLY
		What?

				COLE
		My father told me that.  "Never cry
		wolf."  Then people won't believe you
		if...something really happens.

				RAILLY
		"If something really happens"...like
		what, James?

				COLE
		Something bad.  Is that all the music?
		I don't want to hear this stuff...

	RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.

				RAILLY
		Did something terrible happen to you when
		you were a child?  Something so bad...?

				COLE
		Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?

	It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, "SINCE I MET YOU, BABY".

				IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.)
		"Since I met you, baby,
		My whole life has changed...

	Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.

	EXT.  ACURA/FREEWAY

	COLE'S POV:  the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a
	lover's moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...

				IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		"-- cause since I met you, baby.
		All I need is you..."

	ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.

	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

	Two POLICE OFFICERS and an anxious MARILOU MARTIN listen to an
	answering machine's message while a hungry CAT cries plaintively.

				ANSWERING MACHINE
		Dr. Railly -- this is Palmer from Psych
		Admitting.  There was a guy here this
		afternoon looking for you.  He seemed
		very agitated.  We tried to keep him, but
		he refused 'n I kept thinking, I know
		this guy.  Then, just a few minutes ago,
		it came to me.  It's Cole!  James Cole.
		Remember him?  The paranoid who pulled
		the Houdini back in '89.  Well, he's
		back and he's...cuckoo...and he's looking
		for you.  I thought you oughta know.

	The machine switches off.  The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.

				MARILOU MARTIN
		It's just as I told you -- my husband
		and I had gone ahead -- she never
		showed.  That's totally unlike her!

				OFFICER TWO
			(pulls out his notebook)
		Do you happen to know the make of her car?

				MARILOU MARTIN
		Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that
		cat's starving!  She would never neglect
		her cat!

	EXT.  MOTEL - MORNING

	The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS
	MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.

	INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46

	The TV is on.  A commercial is just starting.  A catfood jingle.

	The sound of HEAVY BREATHING.

	ANGLE ON COLE, sweating, BREATHING HEAVILY, sprawled on one side
	of the double bed, sound asleep.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)

	GUNSHOT!  YOUNG COLE glimpses the BLONDE MAN staggering, wounded.

	The mysterious BRUNETTE races past him toward the BLONDE MAN, and
	YOUNG COLE again glimpses the resemblance to RAILLY, in spite of
	the dark hair, the make-up, the flashy earrings.

	Close at hand, YOUNG COLE'S FATHER, his face still out of view, says,

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Son, it's important for your cat to
		have the nourishment necessary for
		healthy bones and a rich coat.

	INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46

	COLE comes awake with a start.  He stares, disoriented, at the
	CATFOOD COMMERCIAL on the TV.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Please untie me.  I'm very uncomfortable.

	COLE turns to RAILLY, beside him on the bed, frightened and
	helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket.

	COLE'S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his
	impulse.  He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the
	dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons.  He pulls a
	razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the
	bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.

				COLE
		You were in my dream just now.  Your hair
		was different, but I'm sure it was you.

				RAILLY
		We dream about what's important in our lives.
		And I seem to have become pretty important
		in yours.  What was the dream about?

				COLE
		About an airport...before everything
		happened.  It's the same dream I always
		have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid
		in it.

				RAILLY
		And I was in it?  What did I do?

				COLE
		You were very upset.  You're always
		very upset in the dream, but I never
		knew it was you before.

				RAILLY
		It wasn't me before, James.  It's
		become me now because of...what's
		happening.  Please untie me.

	Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.

				COLE
		No, I think it was always you.  It's
		very strange.

				RAILLY
		You're flushed.  And you were moaning.
		I think you're running a fever.  What
		are you doing?

	COLE is rummaging through RAILLY'S wallet, pulling out money.

				COLE
		I'll be back in a minute.

	He heads for the door.

				RAILLY
		No!  Don't leave me here like this!

	Too late!  He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone.

	ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.

				TV ANCHORMAN
		And in Fresno, California...crews
		continue to attempt to rescue nine year
		old Ricky Neuman.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, twisting and struggling on the bed, trying to
	get loose, tears welling in her eyes.

				TV ANCHORMAN (cont. o.s.)
		The boy was playing ball with four
		other children when he literally
		disappeared off the face of the earth.

	EXT.  MOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING

	COLE puzzles over a junk food vending machine, inserts coins tentatively.

	INT.  MOTEL ROOM

	ANGLE ON TV, the picture of RAILLY filling the screen.


	----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING -----------------------


				COLE
		My notes.  Observations.  Clues.

				RAILLY
		Clues?  What kind of clues?

				COLE
		A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve
		Monkeys.  I've told you about them.
		They spread the virus.  That's why we
		have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to
		find them -- it's my assignment.

				RAILLY
		What will you do...when you find
		this...secret army?

				COLE
		I just have to locate the virus in its
		original form before it mutates.  So
		scientists can come back and study it
		and find a cure.  So that those of us
		who survived can go back to the surface
		of the earth.

	RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass
	a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back.

	COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.

				COLE
		You won't think I'm crazy next month.
		People are going to start dying.  At
		first the papers will say it's some
		weird fever, some virus.  Then they'll
		begin to catch on.  They'll get it.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		We interrupt this program with a
		special bulletin...

	RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		This report just in from Fresno,
		California.  Naval sonar specialists
		who were flown to the site...

				COLE
		I thought it was about us.  I thought
		maybe they'd found us and arrested me
		or something.

	RAILLY stares at COLE.

				COLE
		Just a joke.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		-- an hour ago have been unable to
		determine the location of the boy in the
		150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who
		lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into
		the narrow tube claims he heard breathing
		sounds coming from approximately seventy
		feet down...

	COLE reaches over and changes stations.  MUSIC again.

				RAILLY
		Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking
		about that little boy in the well?

				COLE
		When I was a kid I identified with that
		kid, down there alone in that pipe...a
		hundred feet down -- doesn't know if
		they're going to save him.

				RAILLY
		What do you mean -- when you were a kid?

				COLE
		Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a
		hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn.
		Hey, turn left here.  Left!

	COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.

	EXT.  SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY

	An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered
	bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he
	rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES.

				EVANGELIST
		"And the wild beasts of the islands
		shall cry in their desolate houses and
		dragons in their pleasant palaces:  and
		her time is near to come, and her days
		shall not be prolonged."

	ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving,
	COLE, beside her, staring out the window.

	INT.  ACURA/SKID ROW STREET

	COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store
	fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable "RESIDENTS".

				COLE
		Where I come from we think of this as Eden.
		If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown
		food.  Eden!  Look at them!  They donut
		know what they have.  They don't see the
		sky.  They don't feel the air!

	COLE'S POV:  a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING!

				COLE (o.s.)
		And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug
		they haven't a clue.  WAIT!  STOP!

	EXT.  ACURA/SKID ROW

	On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with
	graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.

	Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.

	COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang
	insignias.  We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.

				COLE
		The Twelve Monkeys!!!  They're here.
			(looks around)
		Somewhere.  Come on!

	He pulls her along the sidewalk.  No question, he's insane.

	At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.  Then, still
	keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly
	tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.

	RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when,
	suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...

				COLE
		Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything,
		I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!

				RAILLY
		I'm not going to "do" anything, I
		promise.  But you need help, James.
		None of this is what you think it is.

	ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!  He's found
	another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!

	But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s)
		You can't hide from them, Bob.

	COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a
	voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.

				LOUIE
		No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.
			(conspiratorially)
		They hear everything.  They got that
		tracking device on you.  They can find
		you anywhere.  Anytime.  Ha Ha!

	RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.

				LOUIE
			(touches his back jaw)
		In the tooth, Bob!  Right?
			(sudden triumphant grin)
		But I fooled 'em, old buddy!

	He opens his mouth wide.  NO TEETH'

	COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.

				COLE
		They're keeping an eye on me.

				RAILLY
		Who's keeping an eye on you?

				COLE
		The man...with the voice.  I recognized
		him.  He's from the present.  He...

	COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees...

	there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS

	And further on, another red stencil!

	EXT.  VACANT LOT - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

	CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes,
	oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.

	COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.

	RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly,
	COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.

				RAILLY
		James, no -- we shouldn't be here!

	COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.

	INT.  DARK ALLEY - DAY

	Two TOM CATS face off, arching their backs and HISSING menacingly.

	COLE avoids them as he pulls RAILLY into the gloom.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead!

	RAILLY'S POV:  TWO THUGS, standing over a MAN, kicking him.

	RAILLY tries to stop, but COLE, intent on the wall messages,
	doesn't notice the THUGS.

	The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them.

	These creeps have mean eyes, predator faces.

	RAILLY digs her heels in, forcing COLE to stop.

				RAILLY
		James!  We have to go back.  Those men...

	Too late.  While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending,
	the TWO THUGS are approaching.

				FIRST THUG
		Hey, buddy.

	Startled, COLE turns to face them.

	The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her.

	COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK!  The FIRST THUG smacks
	COLE hard across the face with something metallic.

	Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his
	head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S
	cheek.  It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol.

	RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks
	her roughly to the ground.

				SECOND THUG
		Stick around, bitch.

	Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly.
	RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES...

	COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG'S feet.

				COLE
		Please!  Please don't hurt me!

	The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his
	foot for a second kick when...

	COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger
	man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.

	The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG
	in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him.
	The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.

	Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE
	but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage
	blows that come one after another with lightning speed.  The SECOND
	THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.

	Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for
	the dropped pistol.

	COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw.  The FIRST THUG'S head whips
	back.  SNAP!  He collapses against the brick wall.

	COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley
	as fast as he can stagger.

	RAILLY stares up at COLE.  He looks very dangerous.  He glances
	in her direction as he pockets the pistol.

				COLE
		Are you hurt?

				RAILLY
		Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...

	As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the
	motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.

				RAILLY
		Is he...alive?

	COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a
	handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.

				COLE
		Come an.  We're running out of time.
		You can't help him.

	As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST
	THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.

				RAILLY
		Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!

				COLE
		I did him a favor.  Now come on.

	COLE, pulling her again, sees more "12 MONKEYS" on the wall.

				RAILLY
		You didn't have a gun before, did you?

				COLE
		I've got one now.

	EXT.  SECOND AVE - DAY

	The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him,
	points urgently at COLE.

				EVANGELIST
		You!  You!  You're one of us, aren't you?

	But COLE has stopped and is staring at...

	A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters.  The sign
	over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.

	INT.  FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

	Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired,
	and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating
	leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM.  Behind them, a large
	poster proclaims, "ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO".  Just then, there's
	a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see
	COLE and RAILLY enter.

	COLE looks startled.  It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in
	here.  Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks
	around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.

	Bookshelves line two walls.  The front window is blanked cut with
	posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings,
	photos of animal atrocities.  The fourth wall features the
	counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD
	SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.

				FALE
		Uh, can we help you?

	COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets
	an urgent warning.

				FALE
		Excuse me.  You looking for something
		in particular?

				RAILLY
		It's all right, James -- it's just a tape.

	COLE'S eyes follow her look.  It's a tape recorder underneath a
	sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD".

				COLE
		I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

	FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY.  "We have a problem!" the look says.
	MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the
	counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.

				TEDDY
		We don't know anything about any "Army
		of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't
		you and your friend disappear, okay?

	COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.

				COLE
		I just need some information...

				TEDDY
		Didn't you hear me?  We're not...

	TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.

	COLE is pointing a pistol at them.  A TIGER SNARLS.

				RAILLY
		James, no -- don't hurt them.
			(to the activists)
		Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do
		whatever he tells you to do.  He's...
		upset -- disturbed.  Please -- he's
		dangerous -- just cooperate.

	MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.

				FALE
		What do you want -- money?  We only
		have a few bucks.

	COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again.  A
	BABOON HOWLS with laughter.

				COLE
		I told you what I want.
			(snaps at Railly)
		Lock the door!

				RAILLY
		James, why don't we...?

				COLE
		Lock it now!

	RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,

				BEN
		I told you that fuckhead Mason would
		get us into something like this.

				FALE
		Shut up!

				COLE
		Mason???

				RAILLY
		Jeffrey Mason?

				BEN
		Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.

	INT.  FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)

	The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of
	the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement.  They're very
	frightened, eager to cooperate.

				FALE
		Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big
		star -- the media latch on to him
		because he's picketing his own father,
		a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist".
		You musta seen all that on TV.

				COLE
		No, I don't watch TV.

	COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while
	RAILLY watches helplessly.  Suddenly, COLE finds something he
	thinks he's seen before.  He holds it up.

				COLE
		Is this him -- Dr. Mason?

	It's a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a
	phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.

				FALE
		That's him.

				BEN
			(very frightened)
		What are you going to do with us?

				COLE
			(stares at the photo, then)
		Tell me more about Jeffrey.

				FALE
			(a helpless shrug to his cohorts)
		Jeffrey started getting bored with the
		shit we do...picketing, leafleting,
		letter-writing stuff.  He said we were,
		"ineffectual liberal jerkoffs".  He
		wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to
		"educate" the public.

	COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on
	their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.

				FALE
		Yeah, that's when he let a hundred
		snakes loose in the Senate.

				TEDDY
		But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
		It's counter productive, we told him.

				FALE
		So he and eleven others split off and
		became this underground..."army"

				COLE
		The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.

				BEN
		They started planning a "Human Hunt".

				TEDDY
		They bought stun guns and nets and bear
		traps.  They were gonna go to Wall
		Street and trap lawyers and bankers...

				BEN
		But they didn't do it.  They didn't do
		any of it.

				TEDDY
		Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot
		sold his friends out!

				COLE
		What's that mean?

				FALE
		He goes on TV, gives a news conference,
		tells the whole world he just realized
		his daddy's experiments are vital for
		humanity and that the use of animals is
		absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey
		Mason, from now on, is going to personally
		supervise the labs to make sure all the
		little animals aren't going to suffer.

				COLE
			(holding up a rolodex)
		What's this?

	EXT.  FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

	In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with
	bumper stickers and painted slogans.  "I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS"...
	"FREE THE ANIMALS"..."WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?"

				RAILLY (v.o.)
		You can't just barge in on a famous
		scientist.  They'll have security guards,
		gates, alarm systems.  It's insane, James.

	INT.  MOVING FORD/FREEWAY

	A ROLODEX CARD with an address on "Outerbridge Road" for "Jeffrey
	Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason" rests on a map spread across COLE'S
	lap.  COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY'S at the wheel,
	maneuvering in heavy traffic.

				RAILLY
		If those young men don't get loose,
		they could die in that basement.

	COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing
	cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.

				COLE
		All I see are dead people.  Everywhere.
		What's three more?

				RAILLY
			(a beat, carefully, a new tack)
		You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey
		Mason, don't you, James?  You met him
		in the County Hospital six years ago.

	COLE is studying the map again.

				COLE
		The guy was a total fruitcake.

				RAILLY
		And he told you then his father was a
		famous virologist.

	COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing "Outerbridge Road".

				COLE
		No -- he said his father was "God"!

	EXT./INT.  FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)

	The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open
	highway.  COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving
	the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well.  As
	the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside.  An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	intones over the RADIO...

				RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)
		This just in:  police are widening
		their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,
		prominent psychiatrist and author.
		Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has
		been abducted by escaped mental patient,
		James Cole. The two are believed to be
		traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura,
		license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.

	RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain.  She feels so badly for
	him.  She wants to help him.  She says, tenderly...

				RAILLY
		This can't go on, James.  You're not
		well.  You're burning with fever.

	COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.

				COLE
		We need gas.

				RAILLY
		I thought you didn't know how to drive.

				COLE
		I said I was too young to drive.  I
		didn't say I was stupid.

				RAILLY
		What's the matter with your leg?

				COLE
		I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas
		station up ahead.

				RAILLY
		Shot!  Who shot you?

				COLE
		It was some kind of...war.  Never mind,
		you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.

	INT.  PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)

	The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY
	remain in the car.  She's pulling a gas card from her wallet.

				COLE
		You were going to run out off gas on
		purpose, weren't you?

				RAILLY
		No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James --
		It'll go much better for you if you do
		-- but I'm not going to trick you.

				COLE
			(sees the credit card)
		That has your name on it.  Give him cash.

	RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as
	the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.

	RAILLY starts opening the door.  Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.

				COLE
		Where are you going?

	She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience
	Store appended to the Gas Station.

				RAILLY
		You can come with me.  I have to get
		some things.  Scissors, bandages, some
		alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look
		at your leg, James.  I'm a doctor.

	COLE looks helpless, hesitant.  She's in charge...for the moment.

	EXT.  CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)

	The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.  We HEAR the CAR
	RADIO but not the engine.

				RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
		Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining
		engineers continue their desperate
		attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the
		ant in which nine year old...

	COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the
	Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door.  He's staring up
	at the sun and the sky.  RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.

				RAILLY
		You shouldn't put your weight on it.
		You need stitches and antibiotics.
		Lucky for you it was near the surface.

	RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket
	while COLE continues staring up at the sky.

				COLE
		I love seeing the sun.

	A beat.  COLE tries to stand up.

				RAILLY
		Wait -- let me help you.

	RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.  A beat.
	They're very close.  They don't move.  RAILLY looks like she can
	barely breathe.

				COLE
			(leans closer, shuts his eyes)
		You smell so good.

				RAILLY
			(trying to concentrate)
		You have to give yourself up, you know.

	A beat.  The spell is broken.  He reaches for his pants, then
	turns back to her, suddenly grim.

				COLE
		I have to do something now.  Something
		I don't want to do.  I'm so sorry.

	RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.  He looms over her.  He's
	cold now, steeled.

				COLE
		I have a mission.  It's important.

	RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.

	EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT

	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury
	cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.  Encountering
	another AGENT, he pauses.

				FIRST AGENT
		They find him?

				SECOND AGENT
		Who??

				FIRST AGENT
		That kid.  The one in the pipe.

				SECOND AGENT
		You believe this?  They're dropping a monkey
		down there with a miniature infra-red camera
		strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich
		wrapped in tinfoil.

				FIRST AGENT
		You're making that up!

	ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to
	the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.

				SECOND AGENT (o.s.)
		I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!
		A monkey and a sandwich.  Wonder who
		thought that one up.

				FIRST AGENT (o.s.)
		Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel
		Prize!

	Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.  He doesn't
	see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.

	INT.  MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A formal dinner for forty.  Desert has been served.  DR. MALCOLM
	MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.

				DR. MASON
		Would that I could enjoy this opulent
		dinner and this excellent and
		stimulating company for itself, with no
		sense of purpose.  But alas, I am
		"burdened" with the sense that with all
		this excess of public attention and
		this cacophony of praise, there comes
		great responsibility.  Indeed, I
		practically feel a soapbox growing
		under my feet whenever I stand for more
		than a few seconds.

	While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE
	AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.

				DR. MASON (o.s.)
		The dangers of science are a time worn
		threat, from Prometheus stealing fire
		from the Gods to the Cold War era of
		the Dr. Strangelove Terror.

	AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for.  JEFFREY MASON!

				DR. MASON (cont.)
		But never before, not even at Los Alamos
		when the scientists made bets on whether
		their first atomic bomb test would wipe out
		New Mexico, has science given us so much
		reason to fear the power we have at hand.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.

				JEFFREY
		What are you talking about?  What
		friend?  I'm not expecting anyone.

	ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.

				DR. MASON
		Current genetic engineering as well as
		my own work with viruses has presented
		us with powers as terrifying as any...

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room,
	grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.

				JEFFREY
		This is ridiculous.  My father is
		making a major address.

	INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION

	The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.

				AGENT #3
		Normally if we caught a guy sneaking
		around like this with no I.D., we'd
		bust his ass, excuse the French, but
		this one said he knows you...
			(smirk, smirk)
		-- and, since you seem to have had
		some...uh...unusual...uh..."associates",
		we certainly didn't want to arrest one
		of your, uh, closest...pals.

	INT.  LIBRARY/MASON MANSION

	COLE, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in
	a wingback chair, looks up as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the
	room.  A FOURTH AGENT looms beside the wingback chair.

				JEFFREY
			(dismissing Cole casually)
		Never saw him before in my life.  Go
		ahead and shoot him or torture him or
		whatever it is you do.

				COLE
			(rising)
		You do know me.  You helped me once.

				JEFFREY
			(turning to leave)
		That would be totally out of character.
		Helping people is against my principles.
			(to the Agents)
		See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now,
		I'm going to go back and listen to my
		father's very eloquent discourse on the
		perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS
		INTRUDER TO DEATH.

				COLE
		I'm here about some monkeys.

	Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes.  A beat.

				JEFFREY
		Excuse me -- what did you say?

				COLE
		Monkeys.  Twelve of them.

	JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE.  Then, suddenly, JEFFREY
	rushes to COLE and embraces him.

				JEFFREY
		Arnold...Arnold.

	COLE is astonished.  The AGENTS are, too.

				JEFFREY
			(stepping back)
		My God, Arnie, what's happened to you?
		You look like shit

				AGENT #3
			(dubious)
		You know this man?

				JEFFREY
		Of course I know him.  What do you
		think -- I act like this to strangers?
		Listen -- you fellas are terrific.  I
		thought you were pulling a number on
		me.  What a terrible thing if you'd
		thrown old Arnie out.  I owe you guys
		the big apologia!  Mea culpa, fellas.
			(turning to Cole)
		Christ, Arnie, it's black tie!  I mean,
		I said, "drop by," but, like, this is
		Dad's big "do"...vips, senators, secret
		service, and...and everything.

	JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading
	him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.

				AGENT #4
		"Arnie?"

				JEFFREY
		Arnold Pettibone.  Old Arnie Pettibone.
		Used to be my best friend.  Still is.
		What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?
		No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry?
		Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig.
		Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.

	The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.

				AGENT #4
		These people -- all of 'em -- are true
		weirdoes!

				AGENT #3
			(moving to the phone)
		I'm gonna call in a description of this
		"Pettibone" character.  You go keep an
		eye on him.  Make sure he doesn't do
		one of the guests with a fork.

	INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION

	GUESTS pouring from the dining room into the hall meet JEFFREY
	and a very disconcerted COLE.

				JEFFREY
		Hey, nice ta see ya.  Lookin' good!  Hi,
		there.  Yes, it has been a long time.

	In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and
	COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.

				JEFFREY
			(whispers to Cole)
		County Hospital, right?  1989.  The
		"Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?
			(smiling to guests)
		Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.

				COLE
		Listen to me -- I can't do anything
		about what you're going to do. I can't
		change anything.  I can't stop you.  I
		just want some information...

				JEFFREY
		We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.
			(to a guest)
		I am a new person!  I'm completely
		adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.
			(whispers to Cole)
		Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?

				COLE
		I just need to have access to the pure
		virus, that's all!  For the future!

	JEFFREY studies COLE.  COLE doesn't just talk crazy.  He looks crazy!

				JEFFREY
		Come on, follow me.  You don't lock so good.

	JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing
	back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.

				COLE
		I don't have time to go upstairs.  The
		police are looking for me.  I need to
		know where it is and exactly what it is.

				JEFFREY
			(brightening suddenly)
		I get it!  This is your old plan, right?

				COLE
		Plan?  What are you talking about?

				JEFFREY
		Remember?  We were in the dayroom,
		watching TV, and you were all upset
		about the...desecration of the planet.
		And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be
		great if there was a germ or a virus
		that could wipe out mankind and leave
		the plants and animals just as they
		are?"  You do remember that, don't you?

				COLE
		Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!

				JEFFREY
		And that's when I told you my father was
		this famous virologist and you said, "Hey,
		he could make a germ and we could steal it!"

				COLE
			(grabbing Jeffrey)
		Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates
		We live underground!  The world belongs
		to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're
		like moles or worms.  All we want to do
		is study the original...

				AGENT #4'S VOICE
		Okay -- take it easy.  We know who you
		are, Mr. Cole.

	COLE feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees AGERT #4

				AGENT #4
		Let's go somewhere and talk this thing
		over. Okay? Just come with me...

				JEFFREY
		You're right!  Absolutely right.  Me's
		a nut case, totally deranged.  Delusional!
		Paranoid.  HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED
		UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.

	AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD
	AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.

	COLE is like a trapped animal. He's being led down the staircase
	now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.

				JEFFREY
		YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE "ARMY OF THE
		TWELVE MONKEYS"?  IT'S A COLLECTION OF
		NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN.
		SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN
		FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
		THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE
		RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF
		INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR
		GRAND PLOT!

	COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the
	stairs.  It sounds true!  JEFFREY'S so confident.

				AGENT #3
		Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him.
		Everything's...

				JEFFREY
		MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT
		THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH
		VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE
		"PROCESSED" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH
		YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND
		LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE
		"ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS" BECOMES
		SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY
		CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU
		KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???

	Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free,
	shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.

	INT.  FOYER/MASON MANSION

	COLE heads for the front door, but there's an AGENT there!  COLE
	turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way
	through the crowd of amazed GUESTS.

	INT.  DINING ROOM/MASON MANSION

	SERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS
	burst into the room.

				AGENT #4
		Did a man just come through here...limping?

	INT.  KITCHEN/MASON MANSION

	COOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen
	and look about urgently.

	INT.  DEN/MASON MANSION

	A large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in
	front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		These pictures we are seeing are coming
		to us live from deep inside the pipe.
		You can just make out the metal wall
		behind those roots and I guess those
		must be spider webs.

	MRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern...

				MRS. McCANN
		Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey
		is going to eat the sandwich himself.

	Just then, two AGENTS burst into the den.

	The GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but
	the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it.

	AGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW:  the rows of expensive parked CARS.

	ON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY'S photograph appears.

				TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
		This just in:  Police say that the body of
		a woman found strangled in the Knutson state
		Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly.

	As the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY'S abandoned
	Acura comes up on the TV screen.

				TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
		Earlier in the day, police located
		Railly's abandoned car not far from a
		building where three animal rights
		activists were found bound and gagged...

	EXT.  MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

	Pistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked
	luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles.

				AN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.)
		COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING
		TO HURT YOU.

	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR

	COLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver's seat,
	spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head
	slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out.

	EXT.  PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION

	AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.

	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR

	COLE eases himself into the driver's seat, tentatively slides the
	shift into "Drive", then turns the key.  Nothing happens.

	Panic.  COLE studies the shift again.

	EXT.  PARKED CARS/MANSION

	AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.

	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR

	COLE slides the shift from D (Drive) to N (Neutral).  He twists
	the key again.  The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM!

	EXT.  LAWN/MANSION

	AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.

	SMASH.  The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and
	accelerates right at him!

	AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past
	him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between
	two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.

	INT.  MOVING JAGUAR

	Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.

	The JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH...

	COLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight.  Steering madly,
	he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway.

	EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT

	Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.

	AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life,
	its rotors whipping around.

	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR/OUTERHRIDGE ?OAD - NIGHT

	COLE turns onto the road, careening crazily from one side to the
	other, unable to see ahead with no headlights.

				COLE
		LIGHTS!  LIGHTS!

	He starts hitting switches.  The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES.

				RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
		---when they pulled the monkey out, it
		was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped
		sandwich.

	Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE.

	COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.

	Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.

	INT.  FLYING HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	The PILOT, an agent, steers the chopper while the CO-PILOT pans a
	spotlight over the two lane road beneath them.

	Just then, the PILOT sees headlights below.

				PILOT
		There!  He's showing lights.

	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR - NIGHT

	COLE can see the road now in his headlights as the windshield
	wipers scrape frantically and the RADIO BLARES...

				RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
		We don't know what to think.  They
		didn't locate him and they don't know
		how much longer he can last, that's
		assuming the boy is still alive.

	A spotlight hits the car and COLE hears the sound of the
	HELICOPTER as it lowers over him!

	EXT.  OUTERBRIDGE ROAD

	The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.

	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR

	COLE can see the underbelly of the HELICOPTER a few feet above
	his front windshield.

	Desperate, he yanks the wheel hard, veering off the road.

	COLE'S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:  dense woods ahead.

	EXT.  HELICOPTER/WOODS

	The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.

	INT.  HELICOPTER

	The PILOT skims the top of the trees while the CO-PILOT rakes the
	forest below with his spotlight.

				PILOT
		Goddamnit!  Where is he?

	The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.

				CO-PILOT
		There!  Over there.

				PILOT
		Where?
				CO-PILOT
		Eight o'clock!  He was right there.

	The headlights are gone.  Nothing but darkness below.

				PILOT
		He musta turned his lights of if.

				CO-PILOT
		Couldn't drive down there without
		lights.  We just can't see 'em.

				PILOT
		Maybe he's not driving!

	EXT.  WOODS - LATER (NIGHT)

	A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar,
	crumpled into a tree, the driver's door open.

	A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as
	OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.

	The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the
	Jaguar.  He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...
 
				POLICE OFFICER
		He's not in here.

	EXT.  WOODS/CLEARING - NIGHT

	Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through
	underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.

	Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.

	The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees
	beside the stream.  The car looks empty.

	INT.  TRUNK/FORD

	Total blackness!  The sound of keys in the lock.

	Then, the trunk swings open and COLE stands in the moonlight,
	looking down

	RAILLY is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.

				RAILLY
		You bastard!  You total bastard!

	EXT.  FORD

	COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.

	He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.

				RAILLY
		I could have died in there.  If something
		had happened to you I would have died.

	COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.

				COLE
		I...I...I'm really sorry.

	Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.

				RAILLY
		What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?

				COLE
			(getting to his feet)
		No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car
		and they chased me.  I hit a tree.

				RAILLY
		See -- you can drive after all!

				COLE
		Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry
		I locked you up.  I thought...I thought...
		I think maybe I am crazy!

	She looks at him.  Breakthrough?  Very calm now, the doctor.

				RAILLY
		What made you think that?

				COLE
		Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about
		the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't
		sure.  We talked when I was in the
		institution, and it was all...fuzzy.
		The drugs and stuff.
			(horrified)
		You think maybe I'm the one who wiped
		out the human race?  It was my idea?

				RAILLY
		Nobody is going to wipe out the human
		race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody
		else.  You've created something in your
		mind, James -- a substitute reality.
		In order to avoid something you don't
		want to face.

				COLE
		I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would
		love to believe that.

				RAILLY
		It can be dealt with, but only if you
		want to.  I can help you.

	COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.

				COLE
		I need help all right.  They're coming
		after me.

				RAILLY
		First, it's important that you
		surrender to them instead of them
		catching you running.  Okay?

				COLE
			(brightening)
		It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm
		wrong about everything...the world will be
		okay.  I'll never have to live underground.

				RAILLY
		Give me the gun.

				COLE
		The gun! ... I lost it

				RAILLY
		You're sure?

				COLE
			(showing her)
		No gun!
			(looking up)
		Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!

	RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.

				RAILLY
		I'm going to attract their attention,
		let them know where we are, okay?

	RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn.

				RAILLY
			(calling out)
		They'll tell you to put your hands on top
		of your head.  Do what they tell you.  You're
		going to get better, James -- I know it!

	ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.  An insect!  He
	reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass,
	stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.  The
	HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.

	ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.

	ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.

				COLE
		I love this world!

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS
	from the woods.  The police are almost here.  She gets out of the
	car, starts around toward COLE.

				RAILLY
		Remember, I'm going to help you.  I'll
		stay with you.  I won't let them...

	She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!

	COLE is gone.  Disappeared.

	INT.  POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING

	RAILLY is being "debriefed" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS.

				RAILLY
		Then I said something to him about
		cooperating and he said he would do
		that, so I got in the car and started
		honking the horn.  When I got out, he
		was gone.

				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
		You lucked out.  For a while we thought
		you were a body they found down state...
		mutilated.

	A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.

				RAILLY
		He wouldn't do something like that -- he...

				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
			(interrupts, hands her the photo)
		This the man he attacked?

	RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped
	against the alley wall, obviously dead.

				RAILLY
		I'd like to be clear about this.  That
		man and the other one were..."severely"
		beating us.  James Cole didn't start
		it.  In fact -- he saved me!

				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
		Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can
		explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist
		-- why do kidnap victims almost always
		try to tell us about the guys who grabbed
		'em and try to make us understand how
		kind these bastards really were?

				RAILLY
			(as if reciting)
		It's a normal reaction to a life-
		threatening situation.
			(suddenly animated)
		He's sick.  He thinks he comes from the
		future.  He's been living in a carefully
		constructed fantasy world and that world
		is starting to disintegrate.  He needs
		help!

	INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM

	YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide.

	He sees the BRUNETTE, cradling the head of the BLONDE MAN as he
	sprawls on the concourse...

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Wake up! Wake up!

				GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I think we gave him too much.

				MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
		WAKE UP, PRISONER!

	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE blinks awake. All he can see are blurry faces hovering over
	him, hammering him with questions.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Come on, Cole, cooperate!

				GEOLOGIST
		Spit it out... you went to the home of
		a famous virologist...

				COLE
			(weakly)
		You...don't...exist!  You're in
		my mind...

				SCIENTISTS (IN RAPID SUCCESSION)
		What?  What's that?  What did he say?  His
		brain's fried.  Give him another shot!
		SPEAK UP, COLE.  WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?

	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT - EVENING

	The TV shows film of RAILLY leaving the police station.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		The kidnap victim seemed exhausted but
		apparently unharmed by her 30 hour ordeal
		as she left the police station in
		Philadelphia this morning.  So far she
		has refused to make a public statement.

	RAILLY'S friends, MARILOU and WAYNE, are watching the TV.

	A door opens and KATHRYN RAILLY, wearing a robe, comes out of her
	bedroom.  She still looks exhausted   Followed by her cat, she
	enters the kitchen area and turns on the kettle as WAYNE hastily
	turns down the TV.

				WAYNE
		Sorry.

				RAILLY
		No -- I'm in a state of hyper-
		alertness.  I can't sleep.

				MARILOU
		Did you take the sedative?

				RAILLY
		I hate those things.  They mess my head
		up.

	The old mug shot of COLE appears on the screen and RAILLY remotes
	the volume up.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		Along with the kidnapping of the Baltimore
		woman, James Cole is now also wanted in
		connection with the brutal slaying of
		Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from...

	RAILLY goes to the window, pushes aside the drape, and sees...

	HER POV:  ACROSS THE STREET...A COP keeps watch.

				RAILLY (o.s.)
		Do they really expect him to come here?

	RAILLY returns to the kitchen area where MARILOU is getting the
	tea things out.

				TV REPORTER on air
		And in Fresno, California...

				RAILLY
			(glances sadly toward the TV)
		He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?

				WAYNE
		He's fine.  It was just a "prank" he
		and his friends pulled.

	CLOSE ON RAILLY'S FACE... SHOCKED.

	ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, showing footage of a sheepish nine year
	old boy being led out of a barn by the police.  The cops look grim.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		Authorities have so far been noncommittal
		about whether they will try to file
		charges against the families of the
		children involved in the hoax.

	RAILLY stares at the TV, stunned.

	INT.  "HOSPITAL" ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT

	VOICES!  SINGING!  COLE blinks awake, looks around, confused, then
	stares in disbelief....

	Crowded around COLE'S bed, the SCIENTISTS are concluding a
	ragged, out of tune, rendition of "BLUEBERRY HILL."

				SCIENTISTS
		---found my thrills on Blueberry Hill...

	Seeing he's awake, SCIENTISTS break off the song and applaud.

				SCIENTISTS
		Well done, James!  Well done!  Nice
		going!  Congratulations!  Good for you!

				BOTANIST
		During your "interview," while you
		were..."under the influence," you told
		us you liked music!

	COLE, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one-bed windowless
	room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century
	landscapes.

	The BOTANIST responds to COLE'S obvious disbelief with a
	friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.

				ZOOLOGIST
		This isn't the prison, James.

				BOTANIST
		This is a hospital.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		But just until you recover your,
		uh,... equilibrium.

				ENGINEER
		You're still a little... disoriented.

				GEOLOGIST
		Stress!  Time travel!

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		You stood up very well, considering...

				GEOLOGIST
		Superior work!  Superior!

				BOTANIST
		You connected the Army of the 12
		Monkeys to a world famous virologist
		and his son...

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Others will take over now...

				ZOOLOGIST
		We'll be back on the surface in a
		matter of months....

				GEOLOGIST
		We'll retake the planet.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We're very close!  Because of you!

				ENGINEER
			(unrolling a document)
		This is it, James...what you've been
		working for.

				BOTANIST
		A full pardon!

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		You'll be out of here in no time.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Women will want to get to know you...

				COLE
		I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU
		BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!

	Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break
	through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the
	loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
			(sympathetically)
		Of course you want to be well, James.
		And you will be...soon.

	COLE bursts into hysterical laughter.

				COLE
		YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS!
		YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T
		TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE.
		MADE YOU UP!  YOU CAN'T TRICK ME!
		YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND

		He not only used the word "prank" -- he
		said the boy was hiding in a barn.

	RAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist
	sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.

				DR. FLETCHER
		He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him
		murder someone.  You knew there was a real
		possibility he would kill you, too.  You
		were under tremendous emotional stress.

				RAILLY
		For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he
		knew about the boy in Fresno and he says
		three billion people are going to die!

				DR. FLETCHER
		Kathryn, you know he can't possibly
		know that.  You're a rational person.
		You're a trained psychiatrist.  You
		know the difference between what's real
		and what's not.

				RAILLY
		And what we believe is what's accepted as
		"truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry --
		it's the latest religion.  And we're the
		priests -- we decide what's right and what's
		wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ...
		I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.

	INT. "HOSPITAL" CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Alone in his "hospital" room, COLE struggles without success to
	free himself from his restraints.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You sure fucked up, Bob!

	Startled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and
	continues his feverish struggle.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		But I can understand you don't want
		your mistakes pointed out to you. I can
		relate to that, old Bob.

	COLE looks around in spite of himself.  Nothing to see but the
	walls and the landscape paintings.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey, I know what you're thinking.  You're
		thinking I don't exist except in your
		head.  I can see that point of view.  But
		you could still talk to me, couldn't you?
		Carry on a decent conversation?

				COLE
			(blurting)
		I saw you! In 1995!  In the real world!
		You were a bum!  You pulled out your teeth.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?
		They don't like that.  That's a no-no.
		And when did you say you saw me?
		In...1872?

				COLE
		FUCK YOU!

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Yelling won't get you what you want.  You
		have to be smart to get what you want.

				COLE
		Oh, yeah?  What do I want?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You don't know what you want?  Sure you
		do, Bob.  You know what you want.

	COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth.  Then...

				COLE
		Tell me.  Tell me what I want.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to
		be topside -- breathe the air -- to be
		with her. ... Isn't that right?  Isn't
		that what you want?

	Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment.  When he
	speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper.

				COLE
		More...than...anything.

	INT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	RAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream.  Suddenly, the
	bedside phone RINGS.  Her eyes snap open.  A beat to orient
	herself.  RING.  She reaches for the phone.

	INTERCUT LIEUTENANT HALPERIN'S OFFICE/RAILLY'S BEDROOM

	CLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone.

				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
		Dr. Railly?  Jim Halperin, Philly P.D..
		Sorry to call so early but...

	CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone,

				RAILLY
		You found him?  Is he all right?

	CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows
	giving an "I told you so" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop
	across his desk, then continuing into the phone,

				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
		Au contraire, Doctor.  No sign of your
		good friend, the kidnapper.  However,
		the plot thickens.  I have a ballistic
		report on my desk that says the bullet
		you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's
		thigh is an antique...and all indications
		are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned.

	ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,

				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
		So what I was thinking was, maybe if I
		sent a detective down there to talk
		with you, you could maybe revise or
		amplify on the circumstances....
		Hello?  Hello?  Dr. Railly?

	HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.

	INT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM/STUDY

	Her hand still on the receiver, RAILLY looks shocked.  Then, she
	hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly
	arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she
	finds a copy of her book.  She leafs through it hurriedly,
	locates the picture of the Puerto Rican KID (JOSE) in WWI.

	Peering closely, she tries to see everything in the picture.
	Then, she turns and reaches for a research folder of old
	photographs and rummages through it until she finds...!!!

				RAILLY
		No!

	It's an uncropped shot of JOSE being carried on the stretcher in
	the trenches.  And there in the corner with no helmet, no gas
	mask, and just a bit of bare shoulder showing...it's COLE!!!

	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Clean shaven, clear eyed, COLE sits before the frowning SCIENTISTS.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		The food, the sky, the certain, uh,
		sexual temptations -- you haven't
		become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To
		that "dying" world'

				COLE
		No, sir!  I just want to do my part.
		To get us back on top...in charge of
		the planet.  And I have the experience,
		I know who the people are...

				BIOLOGIST
		He really is the most qualified...

				GEOLOGIST
		But all that..."behavior"...

				ASTROPHYSICIST
			(to Cole, a little hurt)
		You said we weren't "real," Cole...

				COLE
		Well, sir, I don't think the human mind
		was built to exist in two different...
		whatever you call it..."dimensions."
		It's stressful, you said it yourselves,
		it gets you confused.  You don't know
		what's real and what's not.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		But you know what's real now?

				COLE
		Yes, sir.

	The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves

				GEOLOGIST
		He'd have to bone up, catch up to our
		research, the latest clues...

				ZOOLOGIST
		He's proved to be a quick study...

	The ASTROPHYSICIST fixes COLE with a sharp, penetrating look.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		You can't trick us, you know.  It
		wouldn't work.

				BIOLOGIST
		And why would you want to?  It'll be
		dangerously close to the end.

				COLE
		I understand.  There'd be no point.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We're going to think about it, Cole.
		Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.

	INT.  DR. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY

	Standing in front of a wall of glass in his office, overlooking a
	hi-tech lab below where WORKERS in white "space suits" work
	methodically, DR. MASON speaks angrily into a phone.  His male
	ASSISTANT, whose features we don't see, stops writing a formula
	on a blackboard and listens.

				DR. MASON
		You have reason to believe that my son
		may be planning to do what?!!!

	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT/STUDY

	RAILLY, trying to stay calm, is talking to Dr. Mason on the phone.

				RAILLY
		Please, I know it sounds insane but...

	INT.  DR. MASON'S OFFICE

	Dr. Mason on the phone.

				DR. MASON
			(into the phone)
		I'm afraid this doesn't seem very
		professional to me, in fact it's
		distressingly unprofessional for some-
		one who treated my son briefly (if
		indeed you actually are who you say you
		are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest
		in his mental health six years later,
		and to telephone a parent to express
		opinions that would be inappropriate...
			(breaks off, listens, then)
		I don't know anything about "Monkey
		armies", Doctor.  Nothing whatsoever.
		If my son ever was involved in...
			(listens, then,)
		It would be doubly inappropriate to
		discuss matters of security with you,
		Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at
		ease, neither my son nor any other
		unauthorized person has access to any
		potentially dangerous organisms in this
		laboratory.  Thank you for your concern.

	DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares.

				DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
		Dr. "Kathryn" Railly????

				DR. MASON
		The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by
		that man who broke into my house.  She
		seems to have been suddenly struck by
		the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.

				DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
		I attended a lecture once...Apocalyptic
		visions.

	We see Dr. Mason's ASSISTANT now.  It's DR. PETERS, the red-
	haired man who insisted to Dr. Railly you didn't have to be
	insane to think the world was coming to an end.

				DR. PETERS (cont.)
		Has she succumbed to her own
		theoretical..."disease"?

	But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.

				DR. MASON
		Given the nature of our work, we can't ever
		be careful enough.  I think we should review
		our security procedures, perhaps upgrade them.

	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE is facing the BOTANIST who's using a pointer to indicate
	various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall.

				BOTANIST
		Let's consider again our current
		information -- if the symptoms were
		first detected in Philadelphia on June
		28, 1995, that makes us know that...?

				COLE
		It was released in Philadelphia,
		probably on June 14, 1995.

				BOTANIST
		And it appeared sequentially after that
		in...?

	With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him
	from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,

				COLE
		San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de
		Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
		Bangkok, then Peking.

				BOTANIST
		Meaning...???

				COLE
		That the virus was taken from Philadelphia
		to San Francisco, then to New Orleans,
		Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
		Bangkok, then Peking.

				BOTANIST
		And your only goal is...???

				COLE
		To find out where the virus is so a
		qualified scientist can travel back into
		the past and study the original virus.

				BOTANIST
		So that...???

				COLE
		Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed
		that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim
		the surface of the earth.

	COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the
	BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects...

	a magazine photo of wall graffiti:  "ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE
	WATCHING!  IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE SOURCE?  3 BILLION DIE?"

				BOTANIST (o.s.)
		This is from a magazine printed in late
		September, 1995.  The writer speculated
		that this graffiti might be related to
		the epidemic that by that time had
		already killed thirty million people
		world-wide and was getting worse.  He
		says, certain people, unnamed, were
		questioned, but what came of that is not
		known.  But it is a clue you should pursue.

	COLE stares at the picture.

	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT - DAY

	LOUD BANGING!  The storefront window, completely covered with
	posters, quivers violently.  Images of MONKEYS covered with
	electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into
	tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.  It's RAILLY.

				RAILLY
		IS ANYBODY IN THERE?  HELLO?  IS
		SOMEONE IN THERE?  IF YOU'RE IN THERE,
		I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

	INT.  FAA STORE

	JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY
	and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons
	as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters.

				FALE
		It's the kidnap woman -- the one who
		was with the guy who tied us up.

				BEN
		What's she doing?

				FALE
		She's drawing attention to us, that's
		what she's doing. ... I don't know what
		you're up to this time, Mason, but
		you're gonna get us in deep shit!

				JEFFREY
		Whine, whine, whine.  What about walkie
		talkies?  We used to have walkie talkies.

	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT

	From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she,
	seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door.

				RAILLY
		I SAW YOU!  I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.  I
		KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

				RASPY VOICE (o.s)
		Secret experiments!

	RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.

				LOUIE
		That's what they do -- secret weird stuff!

				RAILLY
		You!  I know you!

	But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.

				LOUIE
		Not just on them.  Do 'em on people,
		too -- down at the shelters.  Feed 'em
		chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em.

				RAILLY
		Have you seen James Cole?  The man...?

				LOUIE
		They're watchin' you.  Takin' pictures.

	RAILLY follows his look.

	ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES
	COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.

				RAILLY
		The police.  I know.  Listen, I need to
		talk to James, but he has to be careful
		how he contacts me.  He mustn't get
		caught.  Do you understand me?

				LOUIS
		Uh, yeah, sure.  Uh...who's James?

				RAILLY
		He was with me, he spoke to you.
		Several weeks ago.  He said you were
		from the future...watching him.

	LOUIS gives her a look that says, "I'm outta here!"

	But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously
	"tagging" their way along the street with cans of spray paint.

	RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.

	INT.  FAA STORE

	FALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY,
	and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening
	between posters at the front window.

				JEFFREY
		You get the bolt cutters?

				KWESKIN
		One dozen.  They're in the van.

				FALE
		One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you
		gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?

				JEFFREY
			(grins)
		You really want to know?

				FALE
		No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.

				BEN
		Hey!  Do you know what she's doing?

	Everybody freezes, looking toward 3EN, who's peeking outside.

	Then, except for JEFFREY, they all crowd around BEN to get a look.

	POV THROUGH SLIT:  a glimpse of RAILLY, spray painting the front
	of the store!

				TEDDY
		What's it say?

				BEN
		I can't see it.

				JEFFREY
			(erupting)
		WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN
		PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT
		HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.

				FALE
			(spinning around)
		Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say,
		"your psychiatrist"?

				JEFFREY
		Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about
		flashlights?  How many flashlights...?

				FALE
		That woman is...was...your...
		psychiatrist?  And now she's spray-
		painting our building?

	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT/SECOND AVENUE

	ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY,
	amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting.  He shakes his head wearily.

	ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with
	amazement, too.  They include...

	an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated...

	a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear...

	an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye...

	the TEENAGED PUNKS...

	a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS,
	reacting at the sight of RAILLY.  It's COLE!  He pushes toward her.

				COLE
		Kathryn!

	RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.

				RAILLY
		James!

	With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes
	urgent charge of the situation.

				RAILLY
		James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend
		you don't know me.  If he sees you...

				COLE
			(turning, looking)
		No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?
			(placing his hands on his head)
		Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm
		not crazy any more!  I mean, I am
		crazy, mentally divergent, actually,
		but I know it now and I want you to
		help me.  I want to get well...

	ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as
	she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.

				RAILLY
		James -- put your hands down and listen
		to me.  Things have changed!

	ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on
	his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike:  she
	tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull
	him along...but COLE isn't moving.  He's staring at the front of
	the FAA Store with disbelief!

				RAILLY
		James, come on!  We have to get out of here!

	COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk,
	then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:

			ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE WATCHING!
			IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE
			SOURCE?  THREE BILLION DIE?

	It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!

				COLE
		I've seen that...before.

	But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.

				RAILLY
		James, trust me.  We're in terrible
		trouble.  We have to run.

	Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past
	ONLOOKERS.  She looks crazier than he does.

	ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost
	colliding with a passing car.  BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.

	INT.  FAA STORE - DAY

	ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.

				BEN
		Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her
		and some other guy I can't see.

				FALE
		Hey, no problem, it's probably just
		another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's
		shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.
			(indicating Jeffrey to the others)
		This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic
		who told his former psychiatrist all his
		plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible
		schemes, and now who knows what she's
		painted out there on our wall?

				JEFFREY
		WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON
		WALLS?
			(moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger)
		You think I told her about the Army of
		the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why,
		you pathetically ineffectual and
		pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to-
		animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because
		when I had anything to do with her six
		years ago, there was no such thing -- I
		hadn't even thought of it yet!

				FALE
			(triumphant)
		Then how come she knows what's going on?

	JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a
	supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.

				JEFFREY
		Here's my theory on that.  While I was
		institutionalized, my brain was studied
		exhaustively in the guise of mental health.
		I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied
		thoroughly.  Then, everything about me
		was entered into a computer where they
		created a model of my mind.

	They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY.  Is he
	serious?  Is he crazy?  Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.

				JEFFREY (cont.)
		Then, using the computer model, they
		generated every thought I could possibly
		have in the next, say ten years, which
		they then filtered through a probability
		matrix to determine everything I was
		going to do in that period.  So you
		see, she knew I was going to lead the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the
		pages of history before it ever even
		occurred to me.  She knows everything
		I'm ever going to do before I know it
		myself.  How about that?

	JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.

				JEFFREY
		Now I have to get going -- do my part.
		You guys check all this stuff out and
		load up the van.  Make sure you have
		everything.  I'm outta here.

	JEFFREY exits.  The others stare at the door.

				FALE
		He's seriously crazy -- you know that.

	EXT.  SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY

	An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.

	The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES
	COP'S eyes searching everywhere.

	Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the
	torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.

	HER POV:  the POLICE CAR passes from view.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,

				RAILLY
		James!  Come on.

	A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster,
	bits of lettuce in his hair.

				COLE
		I don't understand what we're doing.
	
				RAILLY
			(climbing out of the dumpster)
		We're avoiding the police until I
		can....talk to you.

				COLE
			(climbing out after her)
		You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn,
		those words on the wall -- I've seen
		them before...  I...I...dreamed them.

	But she's not listening.  She's peeking out the alley entrance.

	RAILLY'S POV:  across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,
	THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

	The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often,
	stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.

				DESK CLERK
		Twenty five bucks an hour.

				RAILLY
		An hour?!

				DESK CLERK
		You want quarter hours, go someplace else.

				RAILLY
			(catches on, pulls out her last bills)
		Here's ninety eight.  For the night.  Deal?

	The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events.  Then, he
	turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.

				DESK CLERK
		Forty four.  Fourth floor, turn right.
		Elevator's busted.

	RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs
	passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas
	chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.

	ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb
	stairs.  As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone,
	punches a number, speaks into the phone.

				DESK CLERK
		Tommy?  This is Charlie at the Globe.
		You know if Wallace has a new girl?
		Sort of a rookie type?  Blonde?

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

	COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY
	pace back and forth like a mad woman.

				RAILLY
		Okay...you were standing there looking
		at the moon...you were eating grass...
		then what?

				COLE
		I thought I was in...prison again.

				RAILLY
		Just like that?  You were in prison?

				COLE
		No, not really.  It's...it's in my
		mind.  Like you said.

				RAILLY
		You disappeared!  One minute you were
		there, the next minute you were gone.
		Did you run through the woods?

				COLE
		I don't know -- I don't remember.

				RAILLY
		The boy in the well.  How did you know
		that was just a hoax?

				COLE
		It was?  I didn't...know.

				RAILLY
		James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

				COLE
		I think I saw a TV show like that when
		I was a kid.  Where a boy...

				RAILLY
		IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!

	COLE looks at her.  She's really upset.

				COLE
		Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV
		show and copied it.  Listen, you were
		right, it's all in my head.  I'm mentally
		ill, I imagine all that stuff.  I know
		they're not real, I can trick them, make
		them do what I want.  I just worked on
		them in my head and I got back here.  I
		can get better.  I can stay here.

	RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.

	It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in
	WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,

				RAILLY
		What does this mean to you?

				COLE
		...I had a dream about...something
		like that.

				RAILLY
		You had a bullet from World War One in
		your leg, James!  How did it get there?

				COLE
		You said I had delusions -- that I
		created a world -- you said you could
		explain everything...

				RAILLY
		Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying
		to.  I can't believe that everything we
		do or say has already happened, that we
		can't change what's going to happen,
		that I'm one of the three billion
		people who are going to die...soon.

	COLE stands, moves close to her.

				COLE
		I want to be here.  In this time.  With
		you.  I want to become...become a whole
		person.  I want this to be the present.
		I want the future to be unknown.

				RAILLY
			(sudden hopeful idea!)
		James...do you remember...six years
		ago...you had a phone number!  You
		tried to call and...

	WHAM!  The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not
	holding.  A menacing figure stands in the doorway.  WALLACE.  A
	wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.

	COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks
	them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.

				WALLACE
		This is my territory, bitch!

				COLE
			(confused, turns to Railly)
		Is this real -- or is this one of my
		delusions?

				RAILLY
		This is definitely real:
			(to Wallace)
		Excuse me, I think we have a little
		misunderstanding here...

	WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face.  She flies back against the
	wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is
	stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife

				WALLACE
		What're you -- some kind of tough guy?
		You wanna be a hero?  You gonna try and
		mess with me?  Come on...

	A beat.  COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around
	WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.

				WALLACE
		Now that's a smart boy.  But you,
		honey, you think you can go 'round
		me and peddle your fancy ass in this
		part of town, you bet your life we got
		what I would call a major goddamn
		misunderstandin'.

	RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs
	her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face
	with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a
	twig!  The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain
	and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves
	the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.

				RAILLY
		JAMES -- DON'T!

	COLE hesitates.

				WALLACE
			(eyes bulging)
		You...heard...her.  Don't do it, man.

				RAILLY
			(gets up, looks around)
		Put him in the closet, ... But get his
		money first.

				COLE
			(amazed)
		You want me to rob him?

				RAILLY
		I...I...We need cash, James.

	A shadow.  RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE
	disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...

				SHOUTS (o.s.)
		They're killing him!  Call the cops.

	Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his
	pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.

				WALLACE
		You two are crazy.  I got friends.  You
		put me in a closet, they're gonna be
		really pissed.

	COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to
his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.

	HER POV:  A fire escape leads down into an alley.

	RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the
	bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.

				RAILLY
		James, no!

	INT.  BATHROOM

				RAILLY'S VOICE (from the other room)
			(rattling the door knob)
		James, what are you doing?

	WALLACE cowers back against the shower stall.

				WALLACE
		I have friends, man -- if you cut me...

	WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don't see!

				WALLACE
		What...the...fuck..are you doing???

	INT.  GLOBE MOTEL ROOM 44

	RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it
	opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping
	with blood.

				RAILLY
		Oh, my God, James.  Did you kill him?

	COLE shakes his head "no" as blood oozes from his mouth.

				COLE
		Just...just in case.  In case I'm not
		crazy...
			(holds up two bloody molars)
		That's how they find us.  By our teeth.
			(a beat, eye contact)
		I don't want them to find me.  Ever.  I
		don't want to go back.

	RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the
	choice he's made.  Given up the future (if it exists, and it's
	looking like it does)!  Risking his life to be with her!  For
	this brief time!  She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears
	welling in her eyes.  But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and
	feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.

	INT.  STAIRWELL/GLOBE HOTEL

	COPS' boots THUNDER up the stairwell.

	INT.  ROOM 44/GLOBE HOTEL

	In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as
	COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.

				RAILLY
		Push it tight!

				WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
		NO PROBLEM!  I'LL JUST STAY IN HERE!
		DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

	INT.  4TH FLOOR HALLWAY/GLOBE HOTEL

	POLICE OFFICERS, led by the PLAINCLOTHES COP, make a cautious
	entrance onto the 4th floor, guns drawn.

	Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into
	their doorways.

	EXT.  GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY

	COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.
	They come to the end of the metal stairway.  It's a long distance
	to the ground.  COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.

	She lets herself down to him.  Their eyes meet.  He holds her in
	his arms for a moment.  Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.
	They start running down the alley.

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY

	The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall
	alongside the open doorway to Room 44.  The UNIFORMED OFFICERS
	are backing him up, weapons drawn.

				PLAINCLOTHES COP
		POLICE!  THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND
		COME OUTTA THERE!

	No response.

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44

	The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol
	extended in both hands.  He pans the gun around the empty room.

	HIS POV:  the open window...the blood on the floor.

				WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
		HEY!  ZAT THE POLICE!  I'M AN INNOCENT
		VICTIM IN HERE!  I WAS ATTACKED BY A
		COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!

	EXT.  BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON

	A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the
	toney downtown shopping district.  Among them, RAILLY looks
	furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  She's hidden her
	bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody
	handkerchief to his mouth.

	As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling
	city, the tall downtown buildings.  His eyes go up.

	COLE'S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  A building
	with a ledge.  The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!

	ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed
	entrance to a store.

				RAILLY
		Wait here.  I'm going to try that phone
		number.  Let's hope it's nothing!

	Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches
	her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made
	intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES
	looming frighteningly close.

	A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display
	window.  Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away

	Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size
	toy in the display window.  Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.

	COLE'S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into
	the phone.

	ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a
	panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  Confused, COLE stares
	at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating
	BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,
	eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.

				RAILLY
		James!  James!  It's okay.  We're
		insane!  We're crazy!

	COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.

				RAILLY
		It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...

				COLE
		A Carpet Cleaning Company?

				RAILLY
			(laughing)
		No superiors!  No scientists.  No
		people from the future.  It's just a
		Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have
		voice mail -- you leave a message
		telling them when you want your carpet
		cleaned.

				COLE
		You... you left them a message?
	
				RAILLY
			(impishly)
		I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved.
		Wait'll they hear this nutty woman
		telling them...they better watch out
		for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

	Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he
	realizes the truth!  He starts to recite...

				COLE
		"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --
		they're the ones who are going to do
		it.  I can't do anything more.  The
		police are watching me."

	Now she's stunned.  She glances back and sees the phone booth
	twenty yards away.

				RAILLY
		You... you couldn't have heard me.

				COLE
		They got your message, Kathryn.  They
		played it for me.  It was a bad
		recording...distorted.  I didn't
		recognize your voice.

	RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.

	ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE
	CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.
	Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him
	into the CROWD.

				RAILLY
		Come on.

	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM

	RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds
	a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped
	on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.

				RAILLY
		And this.
			(turning)
		Anything else?

	But COLE'S not here.  He's a short distance away...staring.

	COLE'S POV:  aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of
	brand new consumer goods.

	ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and
	full of moldering merchandise.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.

				RAILLY
		I guess that's it.

				CLERK
		Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?

				RAILLY
			(producing Wallace's roll of bills)
		No -- I'll pay cash.

	The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!

				RAILLY
		What floor are the wigs on, please?

	EXT.  PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT

	Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a
	PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered
	street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.

	INT.  PARKED PEST CONTROL VAN

	The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among
	them, all wearing black.  Some of them have climbing gear, tool
	belts, all sorts of paraphernalia.  KWESKIN is telling his story.

				KWESKIN
		So then he goes into this incredible riff
		about how his shrink, like, replicated
		his brain while he was in the nut house.
		Turned it into a computer.

				WELLER
		And Fale believed it?

				KWESKIN
		Oh, you know Fale!  He's like, "If you
		guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will --
		I never saw you before in nay life!"

	LAUGHTER from all of them.  Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic
	series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.

	POPE quickly slides the door open.  It's JEFFREY...grinning.

	Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of
	the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.

	The van occupants react with murmurs of "Awwwwwright" and "Far
	out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.

	Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.

				JEFFREY
		Let's do it!

	EXT.  VAN/FREEWAY

	The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.

	INT.  PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING

	The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a
	flashlight and goes over "the plan" with the other ACTIVISTS.

				JEFFREY
		Okay, that's Stage One.  In Stage Two,
		Monkey Four is over here...

	A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.

				GOINES
		What's the harm in opening the bag?
		His eyes are taped.

				SANDY
		Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.

				JEFFREY
		Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.

				ICHIOKA
		So why should we be like him?

	Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing
	DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.

				JEFFREY
		Want the full effect?

	Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.

				DR. MASON
		Jeffrey?  I know it's you, Jeffrey.  I
		recognize your voice.

	JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.

				DR. MASON
		JEFFREY???  ... Very well.  You're out
		of your mind, Jeffrey.  I know all
		about your insane plan.  That woman --
		your psychiatrist -- she told me.

	JEFFREY raises his eyebrows.  This he hadn't expected.

				DR. MASON
		I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy
		even for you.  But, just in case, I took steps
		to make sure you couldn't do it.  I took myself
		out of the loop!  I don't have the code any
		more.  I don't have access to the virus.  So,
		go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract
		anything of use to yourself.

	The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.

				JEFFREY
		What...virus?

				DR. MASON
			(spins his head toward Jeffrey)
		She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew
		you were going to try this.

				JEFFREY
		What virus are we talking about, Dad?

				DR. MASON
		You're insane, Jeffrey.

				JEFFREY
		You "develop" viruses and you're calling
		me insane?  Typical.  What does this
		virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick
		fuck, it doesn't matter.
			(to the others)
		Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I
		put helpless animals in cages and measure
		their reactions to electrical stimuli?
		Do I inject radioactive substances into
		living creatures and examine their
		bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!

				DR. MASON
		Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly
		are you going to do?  I don't have to
		tell you I'm afraid.

				JEFFREY
		THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE
		OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY.
		GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS
		HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED
		FUCKING MANIAC?

	INT.  MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT

	Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward.
	It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods.  SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE
	(KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a
	redwood tree.  We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO.

				SCOTTY (up on the screen)
		Here's a cross section of one of the
		old trees that's been cut down.

	They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,
	"BIRTH OF CHRIST", "DISCOVERY OF AMERICA", "MAGNA CARTA SIGNED",
	"1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS", and "1930 TREE CUT DOWN".

	ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the
	flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.

	ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.

				MADELINE (up on the screen)
		Somewhere in here I was born.  And here
		-- I die.  There's only a moment for
		you.  You don't notice.

	ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the
	theater.  WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES

				RAILLY
		Here, let me help you.

	The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the
	screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's
	doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.

				COLE
		I think I've seen this movie before.
		When I was a kid.  It was on TV.

				RAILLY
			(fussing with his upper lip)
		Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.

				COLE
			(moving his head to see the film)
		I have seen it, but I don't remember
		this part.  Funny, it's like what's
		happening to us, like the past.  The
		movie never changes -- it can't change
		-- but everytime you see it, it seems
		to be different because you're different
		-- you notice different things.

				RAILLY
		If we can't change anything...because
		it's already happened, then we ought to
		at least smell the flowers.

				COLE
		Flowers!  What flowers?

	From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.

				RAILLY
			(whispering)
		It's an expression.  Here...

	She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing
	it on COLE'S head, adjusting it...

				COLE
		Why are we doing this?

				RAILLY
		So we can stick our heads out the
		window and feel the wind and listen to
		the music.  So we can appreciate what
		we have while we have it.  Forgive me,
		psychiatrists don't cry.

	There are tears in her eyes.  They discomfit COLE.

				COLE
		But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're
		wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.

				RAILLY
		In a few weeks, it will have started or
		it won't.  If there are still baseball
		games and traffic jams, armed robberies
		and boring TV shows -- we'll be so
		happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves
		in to the police.

				SHADOWY MOVIEGOER
		SHHHHHHH    

				COLE
			(whispers)
		Where can we hide for a few weeks?

	ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground,
	the OCEAN behind them.

				RAILLY
		You said you'd never seen the ocean...

	EXT.  GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.

	URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.  Then, METAL ON METAL.
	Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen
	with phony rocks.  Stalking back and forth.  Huge.  Upset.

	CLANK.  CLANK.  METAL ON METAL.  GRUNTS of effort, then, DR.
	MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.

				DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.)
		What are you doing to me?  Where are
		we?  Jeffrey, please...

				SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		For God's sake, put the tape back on
		his mouth!

	The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Forget the tape.  The monkey's louder than
		he is.  You gonna tape the monkey's mouth?

	EXT.  PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT

	Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and
	forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.

	EXT.  LION'S PEN/ZOO

	The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.  From the darkness,
	unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.

	EXT.  AVIARIES/ZOO

	A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of
	metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous
	CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other
	EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.

	INT.  MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM

	CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS
	continue.  Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie
	filling his field of vision.

	HIS POV:  the MOVIE SCREEN.  TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by
	screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS.

	ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around.  Empty seats on
	both sides of him.  He's alone.  He panics.

				COLE
		Kathryn?!

	INT.  THEATER LOBBY

	A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock
	Festival".  PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead
	to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a
	tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone.  Turning, she
	reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses.
	She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM!  Crossing the lobby toward
	the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate
	in the tight dress.

	Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a
	Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this
	man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip.  The BLONDE MAN
	stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.

				BRUNETTE
		We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.

	The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional,
	revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe.  The Blonde Man is
	COLE!  He's confused.

				COLE
		You were in my dream just now.  I
		didn't recognize you.

				RAILLY
		Well, you look pretty different, too.

				COLE
		I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize
		it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I
		thought you were gone.

				RAILLY
			(studies him seriously)
		I remember you...like this.  I feel
		I've known you before.  I feel I've
		always known you.

	Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him
	with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked,
	unmarked door, then closing it behind them.

	INT.  STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER

	RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room.  She
	kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other
	janitorial items.  COLE responds to her passion as they move
	deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters.
	Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled
	theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.

	EXT.  SUBURBS - DAWN

	The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the
	silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.
	The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads
	across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than
	reality.  Did we really see him at all?

	EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN

	The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished
	building, deserted in the early morning light.  High up, a MONKEY
	his head around a girder.

	Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.

	EXT.  SHOPPING MALL - DAWN

	Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other
	across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.

	Nothing happens.  For a long moment.  Then, an AFRICAN BULL
	ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along
	the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the
	other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.

	INT.  TAXICAB/CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING

	A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is
	at the wheel of the cab.

				WOMAN CABBlE
		What time's your flight, friends?

	In the back seat, COLE, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to
	his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make-up, RAILLY.

				RAILLY
		Nine thirty

				WOMAN CABBIE
		Might be tight.

				RAILLY
			(startled, checks her watch)
		Tight?  My watch says 7:30.

				WOMAN CABBIE
		On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a
		time, but today, gotta take inta account
		your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.

				RAILLY
		What?  What did you say?

				WOMAN CABBIE
		Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks
		didn't turn on your radio this morning.

	COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.

				WOMAN CABBIE
		Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta
		the zoo last night.  Then they locked up
		this big shot scientist in one of the cages.
		Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!

	RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.

				WOMAN CABBlE
		Now they got animals all over the
		place.  Buncha zebras shut down the
		thruway 'bout an hour ago and some
		kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got
		traffic blocked for miles over on 22.

	Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.

				RAILLY
		That's what they were up to!  Freeing
		animals!

				COLE
		On the walls -- they meant the animals
		when they said, "We did it."

				WOMAN CABBIE
		You can hear it on the radio all the
		stations...

	As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE
	follows her look.

	COLE'S POV:  two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the
	cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
		In the meantime, numerous animal rights
		activists have joined the chorus
		condemning what they're calling the
		"loose canon" activities of Jeffrey
		Mason and his Army of the Twelve
		Monkeys.
				RIGHTS ACTIVIST/RADIO (o.s.)
		Can these fools seriously believe that
		releasing a captive animal into an
		urban environment is being compassionate
		to the animal?  It's mindlessly cruel,
		almost as indefensible as holding the
		animal in captivity in the first place.

	RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a
	backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.

				RAILLY
		Maybe it's going to be okay.

	INT.  TICKET COUNTER/AIRPORT TERMINAL - MORNING

	CLOSY ON copies of the mug shot of COLE and a photo of RAILLY
	while the airport P.A. SYSTEM DRONES in the b.g..

	REVEAL a DETECTIVE, giving the flyers to the uniformed SUPERVISOR
	at one end of the ticket counter.

				DETECTIVE
		Tell your people if they spot either
		one of them, not to try and apprehend
		then.  They should notify us and...

	ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.

				P.A. SYSTEM
		-- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready
		for boarding at Gate Seventeen.

	ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the
	bustling airport lobby.

				COLE
		I know this place! ... This is my dream.

				RAILLY
		Airports all look the same.  Maybe
		it's...
			(turning, reacting)
		James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.

	But COLE isn't listening.  He's looking around, mesmerized.

				COLE
		It's not just my dream.  I was actually
		here!  I remember now.  My parents
		brought me to meet my uncle.  About a
		week or two before...before...before
		everybody started dying.

	RAILLY glances around nervously.

	RAILLY'S POV:  two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the
	lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.

				RAILLY
		They may be looking for us, James.
			(placing the tube in his hand)
		Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
  
				COLE
			(confounded)
		I was here...as a kid.  I think you
		were here, too.  But you...looked just
		like you look now.

				RAILLY
			(getting desperate)
		James, if we're identified, they're
		going to send us someplace...but not to
		Key West!

				COLE
			(snaps out of it, hand to moustache)
		Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.

				RAILLY
			(indicating a sign)
		I'll get the tickets and meet you... in
		the Gift Shop.

	COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men's Room as
	RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip
	clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring
	glances.

	INT.  TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY

	BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as
	COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room.

	Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it.  Coming
	to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.

	INT.  TZCKET COUNTER/TERMINAL

	CLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter,
	hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT
	who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN.  The GENTLEMAN
	walks away.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, stepping up to the counter, smiling, looking
	nothing like the Railly on the flyer.

				RAILLY
		Judy Simmons.  I have reservations for
		Key West.

	INT.  PAY PHONES/TERMINAL

	COLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense.

				COLE
		Listen, I don't know whether you're
		there or not.  Maybe you just clean
		carpets.  If you do, you're lucky --
		you're gonna live a long, happy life.
		But if you other guys exist and you're
		picking this up -- forget about the
		Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they
		didn't do it.  It was a mistake'
		Someone else did it.  The Army of The
		Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids
		playing revolutionaries.  It was
		someone else!

	COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next
	phone looking away quickly.  COLE touches his loose moustache as
	he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.

				COLE
		I've done my job.  I did what you wanted.
		Good luck.  I'm not coming back!

	COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares.
	Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room.

	INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY

	The TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills.

				TICKET AGENT
		Don't see a lot of this... cash.

				RAILLY
		It's...a long story.

				TICKET AGENT
			(smiles, hands over the tickets)
		They'll begin boarding in about twenty
		minutes.  Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.

	Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put
	them in her purse and they flutter to the floor.  As she kneels
	to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from
	the waist down.  WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag
	resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants.
	we've seen this outfit before...in COLE'S dream...on MR. PONYTAIL!

	INT.  MEN'S ROOM/AIRPORT - DAY

	The P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing
	and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying
	his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves.

	Quickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men's
	Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some
	goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly
	against his face as he leans close to the mirror.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Got yourself a prob, Bob?

	COLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE.  Nothing!  Until
	he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an
	occupied stall.  It must be him!

				COLE
		Leave me alone!  I made a report.  I
		didn't have to do that.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Point of fact -- you don't belong here.
		It's not permitted to let you stay.

	A toilet FLUSHES in the "occupied" stall.  COLE'S answer is loud
	and defiant.

				COLE
		This is the present.  This is not the past.
		This is not the future.  This is right now!

	A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the "occupied" stall, gives COLE
	a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.

				COLE
		I'm staying here! You got that?  You
		can't stop me!

				PLUMP MAN
			(high pitched voice)
		Anything you say, chief.  It's none of
		my business.

	COLE looks dismayed.  This guy couldn't be "THE VOICE"!  And there
	are no feet showing under the other stalls.  Did he imagine it?

	INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY

	The Chicago Bulls bag!  It's on the counter in front of the
	TICKET AGENT who's reviewing a stack of tickets in awe...

				TICKET AGENT
		Woooo-eeee.  San Francisco, New
		Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome,
		Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking!
		That's some trip you're taking, sir,
		All in one week!

				MR. PONYTAIL (o.s.)
		Business.

				TICKET AGENT
			(handing over the tickets)
		Have a good one, sir.

	INT.  TERMINAL LOBBY

	COLE emerges from the Men's Room, shaken, paranoid.  He glances
	around nervously.  Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking
	toward the Gift Shop.  Before he gets more than a few steps,
	someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind.

				FAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.)
		You gotta be crazy, man!

	COLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A.
	Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses

				COLE
		Jo...Jose????

				JOSE
		Pulling out the tooth, man, that was
		nuts!  Here, take this.

	JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol.  Astonished, COLE resists!

				COLE
		What?  What for?  Are you crazy?

	Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm.

				JOSE
		Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one!
		You were a hero, man.  They gave you a
		pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come
		back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!

				COLE
		How did you find me?

				JOSE
		The phone call, man.  The phone call.

				COLE
		The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?

				JOSE
		Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago!
		Yes, that phone call.  I been in training
		for this a couple a months now -- ever
		since I got back from that... "weird"
		war we were in.  You remember that?
			(pressing the pistol on Cole)
		Here, take it, man!  You could still be
		a hero if you'd cooperate!

	INT.  GIFT SHOP/TERMINAL - DAY

	RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it,
	includes it with several magazines she's holding.  She doesn't
	notice MR. PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!

	The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and
	frowns.  It's getting late and where's Cole?  She turns, heads
	for the cash register to make her purchases.

	MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already.
	He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.

	The paper features a banner headline..."ANIMALS SET FREE" and a
	sub head..."PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE"
	over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and
	another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.

	Stepping in line behind MR. PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch
	again. Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY
	looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us.

	Startled, RAILLY frowns.  Does she know this man?

	MR. PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the
	shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.

	RAILLY doesn't recognize the man, but we do!  He's DR. MASON'S
	ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...the man who attended RAILLY's lecture!

	Smiling, DR. PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.

	Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the
	CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops
	a bundle of newspapers at her feet.

	RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened
	GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS
	CREATE CHAOS".  Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the
	gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.

	CLOSE ON THE SHOT OF DR. MASON in his lab.  There's someone else
	in the picture.  It's a man wearing a lab coat and a PONYTAIL!

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, suddenly remembering!

	MEMORY FLASHBACK!  INT.  RECEPTION ROOM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT

	RAILLY looks up from the book she's signing and sees DR. PETERS.

				DR. PETERS
		Isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little"
		represents the sane vision and that
		Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!"
		is the cry of the true lunatic?

	INT.  GIFT SHOP - DAY

	RAILLY, stunned, stares in the direction PETERS/PONYTAIL went.

				RAILLY
		Oh, my God!

				P.A  SYSTEM
		-- flight 764 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at Gate 36.

	INT.  LOBBY - DAY

	In the confusion of TRAVELERS streaming in different directions,
	COLE hurries toward the Gift Shop while JOSE struggles to keep up.

				JOSE
		Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole.
			(then, blurting it out)
		Look, I got orders, man!  You know what
		I'm sposed to do if you don't go along?
		I'm sposed to shoot the lady!  You got
		that?  They said, "If Cole don't obey
		this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his
		girlfriend!"

	COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.

				JOSE
		I got no choice, man.  These are my
		orders.  Just take it, okay?

	COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now.  They've got him.

				COLE
		This part isn't about the virus, is it?

				JOSE
		Hey, man...

				COLE
		It's about obeying, about doing what
		you're told.

				JOSE
		They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya
		want?

				COLE
		Who am I supposed to shoot?

	Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.

				RAILLY
		James!  Thank God!  I thought you'd
		disappeared.  Listen, I think I know
		who it is!  I saw him!  It's Dr. Mason's
		assistant.  An apocalypse nut!  The next
		flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38.
		If he's there, it has to be him.

	JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY
	grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.

				COLE
		I love you, Kathryn.  Remember that.

	She doesn't hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.

				RAILLY
		Maybe we can stop him.  Maybe we can
		actually do something.

	INT.  SECURITY CHECK POINT/TERMINAL - DAY

	A young boy of nine passes through the magnetic arch grinning.
	YOUNG COLE!  Exactly as he appears in the dream!

	He joins his PARENTS, who are only visible from their chests
	down, and they continue along the concourse.  WE LINGER and
	DISCOVER two DETECTIVES watching TRAVELERS as they pass through
	the magnetic arch and retrieve their bags from the X-ray machine,
	comparing their faces to photos of COLE and RAILLY.

	ANGLE ON A SECURITY OFFICER, watching the x-ray monitor.

	ANGLE ON THE MONITOR, showing the X-RAY IMAGE of a sports bag moving
	along the conveyer belt.  The bag contains some strange objects.

	ANGLE ON THE SECURITY OFFICER, reacting.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		Excuse me, sir.  Would you mind letting me
		have a look at the contents of your bag?

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, coming through the magnetic arch, reacting.

				DR. PETERS
		Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples.
		I have the appropriate papers.

	INT.  END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT

	RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of
	TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security.

				RAILLY
		Oh, God, we don't have time for this.

	ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his
	Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of
	clothes and a Walkman.

				DR. PETERS
		Biological samples.  I have the
		paperwork right here.

	DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY
	OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		I'm going to have to ask you to open
		this, sir.

				DR. PETERS
		Open it?
			(blinks stupidly, then)
		Of course.

	DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it.

	There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  DR. PETERS pays no
	attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE.

	SECURITY OFFICER'S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a
	SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.

	ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the
	commotion.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed
	glass tube out of the metal cylinder.

				DR. PETERS
		Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the
		papers -- it's all proper.  I have a
		permit.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		It's empty!

	Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.

				DR. PETERS
		Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!
		But I assure you, it's not.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND
	SECURITY OFFICER.

				RAILLY
		Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!

				SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
		You'll have to get in line, ma'am.

				TRAVELER
		We're all in a hurry, lady.  What's so
		special about you?

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other
	metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers.

				DR. PETERS
		You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye.

	A beat.  OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes,
	and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose!

				DR. PETERS
		It doesn't even have an odor.

	The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing,
	and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		That's not necessary, sir.  Here you
		go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have
		a good flight.

	Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and
	shoves them back into his gym bag.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her
	with his finger.

				SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
		Who are you calling a "moron"?

				COLE
		Get your hands off her!

	The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble.

	ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get
	involved.  Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns.

	FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  COLE'S moustache is slipping.  COLE
	senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look.
	For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away.

				SECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.}
		HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT.

	DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen.

	The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from
	the floor beside the search table.  He waves them at DR. PETERS.

	DR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants.

	ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he
	confronts the SECURITY OFFICER.

				COLE
		I said, get your hands off her.  She's
		not a criminal.  She's a doctor...a
		psychiatrist.

	RAILLY looks alarmed at that.

	ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  The FIRST DETECTIVE
	has the photos in his hand.

	ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting
	hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates.

	ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS!

				RAILLY
		THERE HE IS!  HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY
		VIRUS!  STOP HIM!

	ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE
	MAN FROM HIS DREAM!

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.

				RAILLY (o.s.)
		PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM!

	ANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE.

				FIRST DETECTIVE
			(raising his badge)
		Police Officers.  Would you step over
		here, please.

	ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES!

	COLE'S POV:  SCARFACE, dressed like a "businessman"!  He gives
	COLE a cold look.

	A beat.  COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off
	balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it.

	The ALARM goes off!!!!

	The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks
	him aside like a rag doll.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back.

	ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol.

	ANGLE ON THE SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.

				FIRST SECURITY OFFICER
		HE'S GOT A GUN!

	ANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE.

				FIRST DETECTIVE
			STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!
	
	ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward
	DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a
	plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see.

	IT'S SUDDENLY AS IF THE DREAM IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE!!!  THE
	SAME MOKENTS INTERSPERSED WITH "NEW" MOMENTS FROM THE POV OF
	YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR. PETERS
	hurries by.  DR. PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by
	pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling...

				DR. PETERS
		WATCH IT!

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching...

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his
	moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear
	shot in the crowded passageway.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings,
	high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS...

				BRUNETTE (RAILLY)
		N0OOOOO0O!!!!!!

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing!  CRACK!

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him.

				MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		My God!  They shot that man!

	Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE
	MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up
	and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears.
	(WE'VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE IN COLE'S DREAM, A POWERFUL MOMENT,
	UNFOLDING UNNATURALLY SLOWLY, OPENING LIKE A FLOWER.)

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see
	emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the
	BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come along, son, this is no place for us.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER'S ARM drapes over his shoulder,
	steering him.  YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he's led away.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging
	helplessly.  It's too late.  The BLONDE MAN is dead.

	YOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears,
	suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for
	something.  POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her.
	Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS
	(whose faces remain out of view).  He can't help sneaking another
	look back.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting
	RAILLY.  Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically.

	Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...she's
	found what she's looking for!

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded
	concourse.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Hurry up, son.

	With a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG
	COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  WE MOVE IN...CLOSE...
	CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes.  WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS,
	BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING,
	BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HE WILL REMEMBER!

				MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy.

	INT.  747 CABIN - DAY

	DR. PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack
	containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat.  Next to
	him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says...

				FELLOW TRAVELER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		It's obscene, all the violence, all the
		lunacy.  Shootings even at airports now.
		You might say...we're the next endangered
		species...human beings!

	CLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor.

				DR. PETERS
		I think you're right. sir.  I think
		you've hit the nail on the head.

	DR. PETERS' POV:  the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman
	in a business suit, offering his hand congenially.  DR. PETERS
	doesn't know who this man is, but we do.  It's the ASTROPHYSICIST!

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Jones is my name.  I'm in insurance.

	EXT.   PARKING LOT/AIRPORT

	As YOUNG COLE'S PARENTS (seen only as sleeves and torsos) usher
	YOUNG COLE into their station wagon, the boy hesitates, looks
	back, watches a 747 climb into the sky.

			LA JETEE, a Chris Marker Film





	Production Draft
	June 27, 1994








	FADE IN:

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY

	CLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
	with wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of
	the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
	sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
	the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.

	A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
	view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
	to his wound.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
	view, as they steer him away.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come on, Son --this is no place for us.

	YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of
	FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
	up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
	of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
	SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...

				P.A. SYSTEM
		Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at inmate number
		66578, Greely.

	INT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT

				PRISON P.A. SYSTEM
		--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...

	COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
	of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
	corridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.

	Then, as he "recovers" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR
	FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
	ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS
	"REALITY" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE
	"DREAMLIKE" THAN HIS DREAM.

	Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
	GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.

	COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...

				COLE
		Ssssst!  Jose, what's going on?

	JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is
	youthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!

				JOSE
		"Volunteers" again.

	JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
	menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
	close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.

				SCARFACE
		"Volunteer duty".

    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.

				COLE
		I didn't volunteer.

				SCARFACE
		You causing trouble again?

				COLE
			(controls his temper)
		No trouble.

	INT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
	in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.

			TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE

	COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		All openings must be closed.

	COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.

				OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
		If the integrity of the suit is compromised
		in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper
		not closed, readmittance will be denied.

	INT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE, wearing the "space suit" and a helmet with a plastic visor,
	steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door
	clangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker
	now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.

	On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
	COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It

	INT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks
	down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.

	The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.

	INT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

	COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through

	RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.

	The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.

	Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.

	EXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

	A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
	aside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.

	COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in
	moonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people
	anywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.

	EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

	COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
	
	Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
	something.  Finds it.  An insect.

	COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it
	into a collection tube, something makes him turn.

	There's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.

	COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the
	light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.

	ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
	
	Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
	flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.

	INT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked
	floor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!

	The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.

	Then, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More
	dogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!

	EXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

	A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
	and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.

	Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
	buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.

	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)

	COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large
	SPIDER tries to hide from the light.

	COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
	puts it into one of his specimen tubes.

	Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's
	nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.

	EXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN

	As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
	building.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.

	COLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
	logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is
	written, "WE DID IT!"

	COLE looks up.

	COLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION
	patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.

			TTTLES END

	INT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
	wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.

	INT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
	long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
	FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their
	windowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,
	dripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,

				AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)
		Raise your arms above your head.

	COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.

	INT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
	in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws
	blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.

	COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque "window" of thick
	plastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
	behind the translucent aperture, studying him.

	The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.

	COLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...
	a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces
	heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with
	string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a
	dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering
	books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference
	table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,
	BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent
	a "modern" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,
	outdated, patched-together technologies.

				TINY
		James Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Thank you.  You two wait outside.

				SCARFACE
		He's got a history, Doctor.  Violence.

	COLE'S eyes return to the walls.

	Headlines:  "CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!"

				SCARFACE
		Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.

				ENGINEER
		I don't think he's going to hurt us.  You're
		not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?

	COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.

				COLE
		No, sir.

	The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.

	COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We want you to tell us about last
		night.

				COLE
		I went to the surface and I collected
		specimens like I was told.

	The SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully.

				COLE
			(worried)
		I mashed the spider, didn't I?

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		We'll get to the spider later, Mr.
		Cole.  Right now, we want to know
		everything that you saw.

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard
	sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.

				ASTPOPHYSICIST
		Where you collected sample #4, what
		street was that?

				COLE
		Uh...

				BOTANIST
		It's important to observe everything.

				COLE
		I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.

	As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,
	COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
	wall.  One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!"  Another features
	a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)
	and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE".

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Close your eyes, Cole.

	Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.

	BLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.

				ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us in detail what you've seen in
		this room.

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, in this room?  Uh...

				MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		How many of us are there?

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Six...seven, if you count me.

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Tell us about the pictures on the wall...

				COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Uh, you mean the newspapers?

				A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)
		Tell us about the newspapers.  Can you
		hear my voice?  What do I look like?
		What does he look like, the man who
		just spoke?  How old were you when you
		left the surface?

	The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.
	SYSTEM at the airport.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY

	THE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked
	by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE
	land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse
	leading to the departure gates.

				P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)
		Flight 784 now boarding at gate...

	Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the
	monotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn
	to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face
	averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago
	Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.

				MR. PONYTAIL
		WATCH IT!

	YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and
	the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.

	Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!"

	YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as
	TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others
	running.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks
	up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....
	
				TERRIFIED TRAVELER
		Just exactly why did you volunteer?

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)

	COLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Wake up, Cole.

				COLE
		Uh, I didn't hear the...

				MICROBIOLOGIST
			(tapping a pencil on the table)
		I asked you, why did you volunteer?

				COLE
		Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me
		I volunteered.

	The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.

	COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as
	the ENGINEER speaks to him.

				ENGINEER
		We appreciate you volunteering.  You're
		a very good observer, Cole.

				COLE
		Uh, thank you.

				ENGINEER
		You'll get a reduction in sentence.

	COLE keeps his face impassive.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		To be determined by the proper authorities.

				ENGINEER
		You don't want to jeopardize that reduction,
		do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?

				COLE
		No, sir!

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We have a very advanced program, something
		very different, requires very skilled people.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		An opportunity to reduce your sentence
		considerably...

				ZOOLOGIST
		And possibly play an important role in
		returning the human race to the surface
		of the earth.

				ENGINEER
		We want tough minded people.  Strong
		mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes
		with "unstable" types.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		For a man in your position...an opportunity.

				BOTANIST
		Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
			(tapping his pencil again)
		Definitely a mistake!

	COLE gives away nothing.  He's in a box here.  He has no choices.
	He stares at the tapping pencil.

	INT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHT

	A strikingly "real" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintings
	adorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his
	glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty
	seated on folding chairs.

				POET
		Still among the myriad microwaves, the
		infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones
		and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally
		small, byte-sized now, tinier even than
		science lurking in some vague electricity
		where, if we listen we can hear the solitary
		voice of that poet telling us,
		"We are no other than a moving row
		Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go
		Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold
		In Midnight by the Master of the show."

	As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE
	JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-
	eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  She's KATHRYN RAILLY.  And
	it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!

				POET'S VOICE (o.s.)
		"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
		Moves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit
		Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
		Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it."

	BEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET
	looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the
	beeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,
	the glaring POET continues...

				POET
		"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;
		Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:
		Drink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:
		Drink!  for you know not why you go, nor where."

	INT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT

	DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.

				FRANKI
		-- so they get there and they ask the guy
		real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets
		agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
		Totally irrational, totally disoriented,
		doesn't know where he is, what day it is,
		alla that stuff.  All they got was his
		name.  They figure he's stoned out of
		his mind, it's some kinda psychotic
		episode, so they're gonna bring him...

				RAILLY
		He's been tested for drugs?

				FRANKI
		Negative for drugs.  But he took on
		five cops like he was dusted to the
		eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?

	FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed
	glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in
	strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded
	cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".

				RAILLY
		You have him in restraints.

				FRANKI
		Were you listening?  We got two officers in
		the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus
		the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill
		a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.

	RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks
	right at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.

				RAILLY
		That would explain the bruises, I
		guess.  The struggle.

				FRANKI
		You want to go in?  Examine him?

				RAILLY
		Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...

				FRANKI
			(unlocking the door)
		James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None
		of the James Coles on the computer match him.
		No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.
		You want me to go in with you?

				RAILLY
			(entering)
		No, thank you.

				FRANKI
		I'll be right here...just in case.

	INT.  ISOLATION CELL

	COLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vivid
	colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...
	and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.

				RAILLY
		Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.
		I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the
		County -- I don't work for the police.
		My only concern is your well being --
		do you understand that?

				COLE
		I need to go now.

				RAILLY
		I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm
		not going to lie to you.  I can't make
		the police let you go...but I do want
		to help you.  And I want you to trust
		me.  Can you do that, James?  May I
		call you "James"?

				COLE
		"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.

				RAILLY
			(frowns, studies him)
		Have you been a patient at County?
		Have I seen you someplace?

				COLE
		No, not possible.  Listen, I have to
		get out of here.  I'm supposed to be
		getting information.

				RAILLY
		What kind of information?

				COLE
		It won't help you.  You can't do anything
		about it.  You can't change anything.

				RAILLY
		Change what?

				COLE
		I need to go.

				RAILLY
		Do you know why you're here, James.

				COLE
		Because I'm a good observer.  Because I
		have a tough mind.

				RAILLY
		I see.  You don't remember assaulting a
		police officer...several officers?

				COLE
		They wanted identification.  I don't have
		any identification.  I wasn't trying to
		hurt them.

				RAILLY
		You don't have a driver's license,
		James?  Or a Social Security card?

				COLE
		No.
	
				RAILLY
		Why not?  Most people have some ID.

				COLE
		You wouldn't understand.

				RAILLY
		You've been in an institution, haven't
		you, James?  A hospital?

				COLE
		I have to go.

				RAILLY
		A jail?  Prison?

				COLE
		Underground.

				RAILLY
		Hiding?

				COLE
		I love this air.  This is wonderful air.

				RAILLY
		What's wonderful about the air, James?

				COLE
		It's so clean.  No germs.

				RAILLY
		You're afraid of germs?

				COLE
		I have to go.

				RAILLY
		Why do you think there aren't any germs
		in the air, James?

				COLE
		This is April, right?

				RAILLY
		July.

				COLE
			(sudden panic)
		July?!

				RAILLY
		Do you know what year it is?

				COLE
		What year is it?

				RAILLY
		What year do you think it is?

				COLE
		1995?

				RAILLY
		You think it's July of 1995?  That's
		the future, James.  Do you think you're
		living in the future?

				COLE
			(slightly confused)
		No, 1995 is the past.

				RAILLY
		1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.

	COLE looks stunned.

	INT.  POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING

	COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his
	ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.

				COLE
		Where are you taking me?

				POLICEMAN #1
		South of France, buddy.  Fancy hotel.
		You're gonna love it.

				COLE
		South of France?!  I don't want to go
		to the South of France.  I want to make
		a telephone call.

	POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.

				POLICEMAN #2
		Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink
		with your act, but you don't fool us.

	Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight
	overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.

	EXT.  CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY

	A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
	prisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department
	logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.

	INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)

	Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.  COLE
	stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,
	PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.

	As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and
	starts inspecting his scalp...

				BILLINGS
		Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you
		got any creepy crawlies.

				COLE
		I need to make a telephone call.

				BILLINGS
			(pulling Cole's head)
		Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.
		Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.

				COLE
		It's very important.

				BILLINGS
		What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it
		easy, relax into things.  We all gonna
		get along fine if you just relax.

	COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the
	lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.

	INT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)

	COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the
	large room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where
	light pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON
	COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.

	PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily
	at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.

	BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,
	a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.

				BILLINGS
		Jeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.
		Whyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV
		rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?

				JEFFREY
			(with a sly look)
		How much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd
		be doing your job.

				BILLINGS
		Five thousand dollars, my man.  That
		enough?  I'll wire it to your account
		as usual, okay?

				JEFFREY
		Okay, Billings.  Five thousand.  That's
		enough.  Five thousand dollars.  I'll
		give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.

	As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.

				JEFFREY
		Kid around, kid around.  It makes them feel
		good, we're all pals.  We're prisoners, they're
		the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?

	COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are
	playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.

				JEFFREY
		Here's the games.  Games vegitize you.
		If you play the games, you're
		voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.

	COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,
	THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.

				JEFFREY
		What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How
		much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.

				COLE
		I need to make a telephone call.

				JEFFREY
		A telephone call?  That's communication
		with the outside world!  Doctor's
		discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts
		could just make phone calls, it could
		spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone
		cables, oozing into the ears of all those
		poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos
		everywhere!  A plague of madness.
			(suddenly sly and confidential)
		In fact, very few of us here are actually
		mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're
		not mentally ill, for all I know you're
		crazy as a loon.  But that's not why
		you're here.  Why you're here is because
		of the system, because of the economy.
			(indicating the TV)
		There's the TV.  It's all right there.
		Commercials.  We are not productive
		anymore, they don't need us to make
		things anymore, it's all automated.  What
		are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay,
		buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
		But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you
		know what?  You're mentally ill! That's
		a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet
		paper, new cars, computerized blenders,
		electrically operated sexual devices...
			(getting hysterical)
		SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN
		RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH
		BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-
		ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...

	A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.

				TERRY
		Take it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.

	Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and
	continues, completely calm now.  But COLE isn't listening.  He's
	mesmerized by the TV.

				JEFFREY
		So if you want to watch a particular
		program, say "All My Children" or
		something, you go to the Charge Nurse
		and tell her what day and time the show
		you want to see is on.  But you have to
		tell her before the show is scheduled
		to be on.  There was this one guy who
		was always requesting shows that had already
		played.  He couldn't quite grasp the
		idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't
		just make it be yesterday for him, turn
		back time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!

	This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and
	he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.

				JEFFREY
		Seriously, more and more people are
		being defined now as mentally ill.  Why?
		Because they're not consuming on their
		own.  But as patients, they becone
		consumers of mental health care.  And
		this gives the so-called sane people work!
			(hysteria again)
		WHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!
		HALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!
		IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THE
		SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...

				TERRY
		Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna
		get a shot.  I warned you...

				JEFFREY
			(calming himself, smiling)
		Right!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.
		I got "carried away".  Explaining the
		workings of...the institution.

	Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a
	bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.

				TJ WASHINGTON
		I don't really come from outer space.

				JEFFREY
		This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he
		doesn't really come from outer space.

				TJ WASHINGTON
		Don't mock me, my friend.
			(to Cole)
		It's a condition of "mental divergence".
		I find myself on another planet, Ogo,
		part of an intellectual elite, preparing
		to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.
		But even though it's a totally convincing
		reality in every way...I can feel, breathe,
		hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a
		construct of my psyche.  I am mentally
		divergent in that I am escaping certain
		unnamed realities that plague my life
		here.  When I stop going there, I will
		be well.  Are you also divergent, friend?

	The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.

				P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)
		James Cole.  Report to Staff.  James Cole!

				JEFFREY
		Staff!  Whoo!  Time for Staff.  Now the
		geniuses cure you.  Hallelujah!

	INT.  PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

	COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.

				COLE
		This is a place for crazy people!  I'm
		not crazy!

	RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best
	friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit
	around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing
	the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  (Some of the DOCTORS
	bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)

				RESIDENT #1
		We don't use that term..."crazy", Mr. Cole.

				COLE
		Well, you've got some real nuts in here!
		Listen to me, all of you -- I have to
		tell you something that's going to be
		difficult for you to understand, but...

				DR. RAILLY
		James...please.  These are all doctors
		here and we want to help you.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr.
		Railly you thought it was...
			(checking a file)
		1995. ... How about right now?  Do you
		know what year it is right now?

				COLE
		1989.  Look, I'm not confused.  There's been
		a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.

	Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE
	is just grabbing a pad and pencil.

				COLE
		Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.

	FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.

				COLE
			(drawing)
		Do any of you know anything about the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paint
		this, stencil it, on buildings, all
		over the place.

	COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.

				DR. CASEY
		Mr. Cole...

				COLE
		Right.  I guess you wouldn't, this is
		1989, they're probably not active yet.
		That makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,
		three billion people died in 1995.
		Three billion, got that?  Almost
		the whole population.  Of the world!
		Only about one percent survived.

	DOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.

				RESIDENT #2
		Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?

				COLE
		Save you?  How can I save you?  It
		already happened!  I can't save you.  I'm
		simply trying to get some information for
		people in the present so that someday...
			(sees their eyes)
		You don't believe me.  You think I'm
		crazy.  But I'm not crazy.  I'm a convict,
		sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as
		sane as anyone in this room.  I...

	COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLE'S seen
	that tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.

				DR. RAILLY
		Can you tell us the name of the prison
		you've come from?

	COLE doesn't answer.  He's staring at the tapping pencil.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?

				COLE
			(recovering, new tack)
		No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I
		need to do is make a telephone call to
		straighten everything out.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would
		straighten everything out?

				COLE
		Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in
		to them.  They'll want to know they
		sent me to the wrong time.

				DR. FLETCHER
		So you could talk to these scientists
		and they do what?  Send you to the future?

				COLE
		No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called,
		"voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages.
		They monitor it from the present.

				RESIDENT #2
		"From the present."  We're not in the
		present now, Mr. Cole?

				COLE
		No, no.  This is the past.  This has
		already happened.  Listen...

				RESIDENT #3
		Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's
		the present, is that it?

				COLE
		No, 1995 is the past, too.  Look...

				DR. FLETCHER
		These scientists, Mr. Cole?  Are they
		doctors like ourselves?

	Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.

				COLE
		No!  I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given
		a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid.
		You have to let me use the phone.  One call!

	COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.

	INT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY

	Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS
	insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER
	lunges for the phone, answers sharply...

				MOTHER
		Yes?
			(listens, frowns, then)
		Whaaaaat?  "Voice mail"!  I don't know
		what you're talkin' about. ... Is this
		a joke?  I don't know any scientists.
		James who?  Never heard of you!

	The MOTHER slams down the phone.

	INT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY

	A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand.  Sympathetically,
	RAILLY takes it from him.

				RAILLY
		It wasn't who you expected?

	COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts?

				COLE
		It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.

				RAILLY
		Perhaps it was a wrong number...

				COLE
		No.  That's the reason they chose me --
		I remember things.

	RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.
	It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool,
	detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.

				RAILLY
		James, where did you grow up?  Was it
		around here?  Around Baltimore?

				COLE
			(lost in thought)
		What?

				RAILLY
		I have the...strangest feeling I've met
		you before...a long time ago, perhaps.
		Were you ever...?

				COLE
		Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed
		to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's
		not the right number yet.  That's the
		problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?

	RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,
	pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.

				RAILLY
		James, take these.
			(watching him step back)
		Please -- I helped you like I said I
		would.  Now I want you to trust me.

	INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)

	MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.

				MR. PONYTAIL
		WATCH IT!

	Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail?  It was
	definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE.

	TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out...

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		NOOOOOOOOOO!

	The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but
	doesn't speak.  The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!

	Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It's
	the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  He's
	sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his
	moustache slightly askew!

	A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.
	Everything goes white!

	INT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

	COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.

	He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.
	Which world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,
	occasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of
	an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.

	His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.

	He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.

	With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of
	bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.

	COLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single
	tree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.

	ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.

				VOICE (o.s.)
		It won't work. You can't open it.

	Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.

				JEFFREY
		You think you can remove the grill but
		you can't.  It's welded.

	COLE checks the grill anyway.

				JEFFREY
		See?  I toldja.  And all the doors are
		locked, too.  They're protecting the
		people on the outside from us.  But the
		people outside are as crazy as us.

	COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along
	the window sill.  He's staring at it when he's distracted by a
	sudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed
	just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with
	the blade of his flashlight.

	ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.

	The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.

	For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,
	SNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse
	whisper, picking up right where he left off.

				JEFFREY
		You know what "crazy" is?  "crazy" is
		"majority rules".  Take germs for example.

	Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get
	out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!

				COLE
		Germs?!

				JEFFREY
		In the 18th century there was no such
		thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a
		thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along
		comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I
		think.  He tries to convince people...
		other doctors mostly...that there are
		these teeny tiny invisible "bad things"
		called germs that get into your body and
		make you...sick!  He's trying to get
		doctors to wash their hands.  What is
		this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible
		whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!

	As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to
	figure out where to put the SPIDER.

				JEFFREY (cont.)
		So cut to the 20th century!  Last week
		in fact, right before I got dragged
		into this hellhole.  I order a burger
		in this fast food joint.  The waiter
		drops it on the floor.  He picks it up,
		wipes it off, hands it to me...like it
		was all okay.

	No alternative.  COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows
	it as JEFFREY prattles on...

				JEFFREY
		"What about the germs?"  I say.  He
		goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs
		are just a plot they made up so they
		can sell you disinfectants and soap!"
		Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you
		believe in germs, don't you?

				COLE
		I'm not crazy.

				JEFFREY
		Of course not, I never thought you were.
		You want to escape, right?  That's very
		sane.  I can help you.  You want me to,
		don't you?  Get you out?

				COLE
		If you know how to escape, why don't you...?

				JEFFREY
		Why don't I escape, that's what you
		were going to ask me, right?  'Cause
		I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken
		care of, see?  I've sent out word.

				COLE
		What's that mean?

				JEFFREY
		I've managed to contact certain underlings,
		evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and
		assorted minions, who will contact my father.
		When he learns I'm in this kind of place,
		he'll have them transfer me to one of those
		classy joints where they treat you...properly.
		LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS!
		TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS
		FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...

	PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the
	dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself.

				JEFFREY
		Sorry.  Really sorry.  Got a little
		agitated.  The thought of escaping
		crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly
		I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS
		BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW
		FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING
		THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...

	COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.

				JEFFREY
		You dumb assholes!  I'm a mental patient!
		I'm supposed to act out.  Wait til you
		morons find out who I am.  My father's
		gonna be really upset.  AND WHEN MY
		FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES!
		MY FATHER IS GOD!  I WORSHIP MY FATHER.

	INT.  WARD DAYROOM - MORNING

	ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing
	pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached
	to his tiny, restrained body.

	ANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with
	crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty
	robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Torture!  Experiments!  We're all
		monkeys

	COLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes
	the seat next to him.

				COLE
		They hurt you!

				JEFFREY
		Not as bad as what they're doing to
		kitty.

	ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles,
	eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates.

				TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.)
		These video tapes were obtained by
		animal rights activists who worked
		underground as laboratory assistants
		for several months.  Authorities say
		there is little they can do until...

	The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of
	their experiments passively.

	ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.

				COLE
		Look at those assholes, they're asking
		for it!  Maybe people deserved to be
		wiped out!

				JEFFREY
			(startled, turning)
		Wiping cut the human race!  That's a
		great idea!  But it's more of a long
		term thing -- right now we have to
		focus on more immediate goals.
			(sudden whisper)
		I didn't say a word about "you know
		what".

				COLE
		What are you talking about???

				JEFFREY
		You know -- your plan.

	As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine.

				JEFFREY
		What're you writing?  You a reporter?

				COLE
			(shielding the magazine)
		It's private.

				JEFFREY
		A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?

	Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills.

				BILLINGS
		Yo, James -- time to take your meds.

	INT.  DAY ROOM/HOSPITAL - THIRTY MINUTES LATER (MORNING)

	ANGLE ON THE TV, a commercial playing:  a beautiful couple romps
	in the surf in slow motion while an eager NARRATOR encourages...

				NARRATOR (v.o.)
		Take a chance.  Live the moment.  Sunshine.
		Gorgeous beaches.  The Florida Keys!

	ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with
	other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen.

	ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers.

				TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.)
		We'll return to the Marx Brothers in
		"Monkey Business" following these
		messages.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Monkey Business!  Monk Key Business.

	COLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking.
	
				JEFFREY
		Get it?  Monk - Key.  Monk!
			(big grin)
		Key!

	JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment.  A KEY!

				COLE
			(groggy)
		What....???

				JEFFREY
		Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro.
		Major load!  Listen up -- try and get
		it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan!
		Remember?  I did my part.

				COLE
		What...???

				JEFFREY
		Not, "what", babe!  When!

		"When???"

				JEFFREY
			(pressing the key into Cole's hand)
		Now!

				VOICE/TV (o.s.)
		Let us guide you to the stocks and
		bonds that will enhance your portfolio.

				JEFFREY
			(leaping to his feet)
		YES -- NOW!  BUY NOW!  STOCKS AND BONDS!
		NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW.

	ANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a
	BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating.

				VOICE/TV (v.o.)
		A portfolio tailored to your specific
		needs and the needs of your loved ones...

	ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily.

				JEFFREY
		YES, YES.  ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!

	ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go
	of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a
	beeper, calling for help.

	ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room.

				JEFFREY
		BUY!  SELL!  SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!

	ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE
	KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE.  Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the
	puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just
	completed the puzzle stares, very upset.

	Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a
	lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.

				HEAVY WOMAN PATIENT
		I'M GETTING DIZZY.  MAKE HIM STOP!

				SKINNY MAN PATIENT
		HERE THEY COME!  THEY'RE COMING!

				OLD MAN PATIENT
		FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I GOT FIVE
		HUNDRED DOLLARS!  I'M INSURED!

				JEFFREY
		OPPORTUNITY!  DEFINITELY!  A WINDOW OF
		OPPORTUNITY!  OPENING NOW!  NOW'S THE TIME
		FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT!  YES!
		YES!  MASTERCARD!  VISA!  THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!

	ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY
	is sending a message to him.  COLE looks at the ward door.

	COLE'S POV:  the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter.
	One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached
	to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.

				JEFFREY
		SEIZE THE MOMENT!  GET RICH!  NOW'S THE
		TIME!  GO FOR IT!

				BILLINGS
			(missing a tackle)
		God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.

	ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating.  He locks at the door...blurring in
	and out of focus.  He looks down at the key in his hand.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES.  JEFFREY
	resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.

				JEFFREY
		LAST CHANCE!  LAST CHANCE!  HEY -- OW!

	ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door.  He reaches it and tries to
	insert the key in the lock.

	ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.

	ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.

	COLE'S POV:  ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE.

	ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key.  It won't turn.

	A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.

				PATIENT
		Place to go would be...Florida.  The
		keys are lovely this tine of year.

	COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again.  It turns.

				PATIENT
		Be careful.  J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead.

	COLE pauses, stares, not understanding.  Then, he opens the door.

	INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL

	Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room
	facing several elevators.

	A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn't even
	lock up from the magazine he's reading.

	Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his
	back is to the SECURITY MAN.  But he doesn't know how to control
	this elevator.  What should he do?

				SECURITY MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Two's not working today.  Use one.

	COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.

	COLE'S POV:  the SECURITY MAN continues his reading.  He's a big
	guy with reading glasses perched on his nose.  He looks exactly
	like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!

	ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!

	Just then, an elevator door slides open.  The elevator's empty.

	COLE steps into it.

	INT.  ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL

	The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.

	COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator
	springs to life.  The numbers on the indicator over the door
	start to rise.  7...8...9.

	Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.

	Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.

	COLE hesitates.

	They look at him.  They seem to expect him to exit.

	Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.

	As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.

	INT.  RAILLY'S OFFICE - MORNING

	RAILLY has just arrived for work.  She's slipping on her white
	doctor's coat when...

	DR. CASEY, one of the other residents, sticks his head in the
	door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine.

				DR. CASEY
		This was in my box, but I have a slight
		suspicion it wasn't meant for me.

	CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.

				DR. CASEY
		"You are the most beautiful woman I have
		ever seen.  You live in a beautiful
		world.  But you don't know it.  You have
		freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe."

				RAILLY
			(smiling)
		Cole.  James Cole -- right?

	She reaches for the note but CASEY moves it out of her grasp.

				DR. CASEY
		"I would do anything to stay here, but
		I must leave.  Please, help me."

				RAILLY
		Poor man...

	CASEY is handing her the note when another resident, DR. GOODINS,
	sticks his head in the door.  He's upset.

				DR. GOODINS
		Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of
		yours, right?

	RAILLY and CASEY stare at him.

				DR. GOODINS
		He got out.  Took off.  Last seen, he
		was up on nine.

    INT.  X-RAY DEPARTMENT/BASEMENT - DAY

    A PATIENT is being swallowed by a large tube, a CAT SCANNER,
    while a DOCTOR in a white coat speaks reassuringly.

				DOCTOR
		Just relax -- don't fight it.  We have
		to know exactly what's there so we can...

	The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open.

	It's COLE!  He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner.

	The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.

				DOCTOR
		Eh, excuse me.  Can I help you?

	COLE turns and rushes back out the door.

	INT.  CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL

	COLE steps into the corridor, turns to his right, freezes.

	A POSSE of SECURITY GUARDS is headed in his direction.

	COLE turns to his left.

	Four ORDERLIES are coming that way.

	COLE'S trapped.  A beat.  He attacks the nearest man.  BILLINGS.

	INT.  TECH ROOM/PSYCH WARD - SHORTLY (DAY)

	RAILLY prepares a hypo, turns to COLE who is strapped tightly on
	a gurney with BILLINGS and an RN standing on either side, tense
	for more trouble.  One of BILLINGS' eyes is starting to swell shut.

				RAILLY
		It's just a shot to calm you.

				COLE
		No more drugs.  Please...

				RAILLY
		I have to do this, James.  You're very
		confused.

	RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin.

	INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY)

	DR. FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table.  DR.
	CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there.

				DR. FLETCHER
		Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't
		an inquisition.

				RAILLY
		I didn't think I was being defensive.
		I was just...

				DR. FLETCHER
		He should have been in restraints.  It
		was bad judgment on your part, plain
		and simple.  why not just cop to it?

				RAILLY
		Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have
		the strangest feeling about him -- I've
		seen him somewhere and...

				DR. FLETCHER
			(impatient, not interested)
		Two policemen were already in the
		hospital and now we have an orderly
		with a broken arm and a Security
		Officer with a fractured skull.

				RAILLY
		I said it was bad judgment!  What else
		do you want me to say?

				DR. FLETCHER
		You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.
			(to Dr. Casey)
		Isn't she being defensive, Bob?

	But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.

				BILLINGS
		Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another...
		situation.

	INT.  CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

	DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN,
	GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.

				DR. FLETCHER
		He was in full restraints?  And the
		door was locked?

				BILLINGS
		Yes, sir.  Did it myself.

				DR. FLETCHER
		And he was fully sedated?

				RAILLY
		He was fully sedated!

				DR. FLETCHER
		Then are you trying to tell me that a
		fully sedated, fully restrained patient
		somehow slipped out that vent, replaced
		the grill behind him and that he's wriggling
		through the ventilation system right now?

	DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)

	Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into
	the sky as the airport P.A. System drones...

				P.A. SYSTEM
		Flight 784 to San Francisco now
		boarding at Gate 38...

	YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION.

	MR. PONYTAIL bumps him.

	The BLONDE MAN sprints past.  The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out!

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		NOOOOOOOOOO!

	TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE
	running after the BLONDE MAN!  But this time, YOUNG COLE catches
	just a glimpse of her face.  She looks a little like RAILLY except
	for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings.  She
	calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM...

				BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM
		The Freedom For Animals Headquarters
		now boarding on Second Avenue.  The
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

				ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Cole, you moron -- wake up!

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE

	As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM
	continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE...

				UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM
		-- they're the ones who are going to do it...

	COLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table
	in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him.  It's
	a beat-up old tape recorder.

				UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER
		I can't do anything more.  The Police
		are after me.

	The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Well?

				COLE
		Uh, what?

				ENGINEER
		He's drugged out of his mind!  He's
		completely zoned out.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Cole, did you or did you not record
		that message?

				COLE
		Uh, that message...me?

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		It's a digital reconstruction of a
		message, Cole, from a weak signal on our
		contact number.  Did you make that call?

				COLE
			(angrily)
		I couldn't call!  You sent me to the
		wrong year!  It was 1989.

				SCIENTISTS
		1989!

	The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers.  Then,

				ZOOLOGIST
		You're certain of that?

				GEOLOGIST
			(before Cole can answer)
		What did you do with your time, Cole?
		Did you waste it on drugs?  Women?

				COLE
		They forced me to take drugs.

				BOTANIST
		Forced you!  Why would someone force
		you to take drugs?

				COLE
		I got into trouble.  I got arrested.
		But I still got you a specimen -- a
		spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to
		put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong
		year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.

	The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing
	looks, huddle, start whispering to one another.

	Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST
	staring at COLE intently.  For one moment, the face belongs to
	DR. FLETCHER!

	COLE blinks hard...and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again.

	COLE'S head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.

				GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Cole!

	INT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE

	COLE comes awake with a start.  The room is dark now, except...

	a slide is being projected on a torn screen.  It's a picture of a
	stenciled graffiti...the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

				ENGINEER
		What about it, Cole?

				ZOOLOGIST
		Did you see it?

				COLE
		Uh, no, sir.  I...

	Another slide CLICKS into place.  Youthful PROTESTERS, their
	placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities,
	confront POLICE in riot gear.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		What about these people?  Did you see
		any of these people?

	Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the
	PROTESTERS.  The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will
	recognize some of them later on).

				COLE (o.s.)
		Uh, no, sir, I...wait!

	The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the
	PROTESTERS.  In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage
	is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Him?  You saw that man?

				COLE
		Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.

				MICRO3IOLOGIST
			(switching on the light)
		You were in a mental institution?!

	The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		You were sent to make very important
		observations!

				BOTANIST
		You could have made a real contribution.

				GEOLOGIST
		Helped to reclaim the planet...

				ZOOLOGIST
		As well as reducing your sentence.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		The question is, Cole -- "Do you want
		another chance?"

	COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)

	The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as
	frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey!  Who's that?

	INT.  CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE opens his eyes.  Where is he?  Silence as he examines the
	tiny cell.  Bare cement walls.  High ceiling.  Same color and
	size as the isolation room at the county hospital.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey, Bob...what's your name?

	COLE looks around frantically.  Up, down.  Where is the VOICE
	coming from?  Maybe from that tiny vent high in the wall...

				COLE
		Where are you?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You can talk!  Wah'dja do, Bobby boy?
		Volunteer?

				COLE
		My name's not "Bob".

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Not a prob, Bob.  Where'd they send you?

				COLE
		Where are you?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Another cell. ...  Maybe.

				COLE
		What do you mean, "maybe"?  What's that
		supposed to mean?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Maybe.  Means "maybe" I'm in the next cell,
		another "volunteer" like you -- or "maybe"
		I'm in the Central Office spying on you
		for all those science bozos.  Or, hey, "maybe"
		I'm not even here.  "Maybe" I'm just in
		your head.  No way to confirm anything.
		Ha Ha.  Where'd they send you?

	COLE doesn't answer.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Not talking, huh, Bob?  That's okay
		I can handle that.

				COLE
		1989.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		89!  How was it?  Good drugs?  Lotsa
		pussy?  Hey, Bob, you do the job?  D'ju
		find out the "big info"?...Army of the
		Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was
		prior to mutation?

				COLE
		It was supposed to be 1995.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Science isn't an exact science with
		these clowns.  You're lucky you didn't
		end up in ancient Egypt!

	INT.  LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE

	COLE is strapped on a gurney.  SCIENTISTS hover near-by,
	whispering.  The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.

				GEOLOGIST
		No mistakes this time, Cole.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Stay alert.  Keep your eyes open.

				ZOOLOGIST
		Good thinking about that spider, Cole.
		Try and do something like that again.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Just relax now -- don't fight it.  We
		have to know exactly what's there so we
		can fix it.

	The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube...
	reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital.

	COLE'S POV:  a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber
	door is CLANGED shut.

	EVERYTHING IS BLACK.  A HUM BUILDS.  THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE
	HUM REACHES A DEAFENING LEVEL, THEN DIMUENDOS.  WE BEGIN TO HEAR
	BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE, VOICES SHOUTING IN FRENCH, A SUDDEN
	HUGE EXPLOSION!  THEN...

	EXT.  TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY

	DRIZZLING RAIN.  And SCREAMS.  COLE'S in a deep trench, naked,
	eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he?  SOLDIERS
	in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured
	COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit
	fifteen yards away.  Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks...
	in FRENCH.  COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I!
	Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.

				SERGEANT
			(FRENCH, subtitled)
		Where's your mask?!  And your clothes...
		and your weapon, you idiot?!

				COLE
		What?  What??

	COLE looks around desperately.  A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being
	stretchered past them in the narrow trench.  Machine guns chatter
	close at hand.  AAK AAK AAK.  A grenade EXPLODES.  Reacting to the
	foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs...

				SERGEANT
			(FRENCH, subtitled)
		Captain!  A Kraut!  We got a Kraut!

				COLE
		I don't understand.  Where am I?

	The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.

				CAPTAIN
			(GERMAN, subtitled)
		How'd you get here, soldier?  What's
		your rank?  Where are your clothes?

				COLE
		I...don't understand.

				CAPTAIN
			(frowning, GERMAN, subtitled)
		German!  Speak German!  What are you
		doing here?

				VOICE (o.s.)
			(pleading in English)
		I gotta find 'em.  I gotta find 'em.
		Please, you gotta help me!

	COLE turns, sees...

	It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in
	the "underground" time.  He's being carried past COLE now on a
	stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.

				COLE
		JOSE!

				JOSE
		Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?

	JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH
	PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher.  SUDDENLY,
	SHOTS RING OUT.  COLE goes down.  Hit in the leg!

	SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.

	Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead
	from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.

	COLE is reaching for the mask when...

	A SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.

	EXT.  COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

	Stunningly quiet.  We are on a placid campus looking at the
	dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall.  MOVING IN we FOCUS ON
	a large poster advertising "The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995".
	WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew
	Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON...

				DR. KATHRYN RAILLY
			MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS
					MAY 17

	INT.  AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT

	A large screen dominates the auditorium stage.  On the screen is
	a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in
	apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained
	by PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE
	of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		According to the accounts of local
		officials at that time, this gentleman,
		judged to be about forty years of age,
		appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle
		near Stonehenge in the West of England in
		April of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and
		speaking in a strange accent, the man made
		dire prognostications about a pestilence
		which he predicted would wipe out humanity
		in approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and
		hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the
		village, was taken into custody, but then
		mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.

	WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern
	in a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the
	engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
	scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an
	audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.

					RAILLY (cont.)
		In 1841, Mackay wrote, "During seasons
		of great pestilence, men have often
		believed the prophecies of crazed
		fanatics, that the end of the world was
		come."  Obviously, this plague/doomsday
		scenario is considerably more compelling
		when reality supports it in some form,
		whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,
		or AIDS.  In addition to these "natural"
		contagions, there are now technological
		horrors as well:  besides radiation,
		consider our lurking fear of germ
		warfare and its close approximation,
		chemical warfare, which first reared
		its ugly head in the deadly mustard
		gas attacks during the First World War.

	ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I
	SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		During such an attack in the French
		trenches in October, 1917, we have an
		account of this soldier...

	ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
	JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried
	by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears
	to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until
	the image approximates Munch's famous painting.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)
		-- who, during an assault, was wounded
		by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
		lines where Doctors discovered he had
		lost all comprehension of French but
		spoke English fluently, albeit in a
		regional dialect they didn't recognize.
		The man, although physically unaffected
		by the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed
		he had come from the future, that he was
		looking for a pure germ that would
		ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
		the earth in the year... 1995!

	The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.

	ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time
	he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
		Although seriously injured, the young
		soldier disappeared from the hospital
		before more data could be gathered.  No
		doubt, he was trying to carry on his
		mission to warn others, substituting
		for the agony of war...a self-inflicted
		agony we call the "Cassandra Complex".

	As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,
	RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening
	attentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with
	shoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.

				RAILLY (cont.)
		Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,
		was condemned to know the future but to be
		disbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,
		the agony of foreknowledge combined with
		impotence to do anything about it.

	INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)

	A stack of new books.  THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, Apocalyptic
	Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn Railly

	Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY is
	seated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.

				DR. PETERS
		I think, Dr. Railly, you have given
		your alarmists a bad name.  Surely
		there is very real and very convincing
		data that the planet cannot survive the
		excesses of the human race:  proliferation
		of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding
		habits, the rape of the environment, the
		pollution of land, sea, and air.  In this
		context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken
		Little" represents the sane vision and
		that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go
		shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?

	DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly
	disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.
 
				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
		Doctor Railly -- please!  I wonder if
		you're aware of my own studies which
		indicate that certain cycles of the
		moon actually impact on the incidence
		of apocalyptic predictions as observed
		in urban emergency rooms and...

	As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE
	CHANG, appear and whisper...

				MARILOU
		You were great.

				RAILLY
		You're leaving?

				MARILOU
		The reservation's at nine thirty --
		it's getting late.

				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
		Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very
		important!

				WAYNE CHANG
			(checking the professor)
		You sure you're gonna be all right?

				RAILLY
			(smiles, checks her watch)
		I'll be there in twenty minutes.

				DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
		Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand
		your exclusion of the moon in relation
		to apocalyptic dementia...

	EXT.  PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT

	A full moon.

	COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,
	"Congratulations" to RAILLY.

	She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last
	cars left in the lot.

	The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.

	RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
	purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...

	Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large
	shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Get in!

	Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the
	front seat.

				MAN'S VOICE
		I've got a gun.

	RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and
	scrambles in behind her.

	INT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT

	Fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice, RAILLY says...

				RAILLY
		You can have my purse.  I have a lot of
		cash and credit...

				MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Start the car.

	Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes
	peering out of the shadows, no other features.

	Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.

				RAILLY
		Here!  You can have the keys.  You can...

	He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely
	into her ear, his face last in shadow.

				MAN
		START THE CAR!  NOW!

	EXT.  ACURA/PARKING LOT

	The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.

	INT.  ACURA

	Steering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.

				MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
		I don't want to hurt you.  But I will.
		I've hurt people before when...when I
		had no choice.  Turn left.

	As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,
	sees him unfolding a tattered map.  His face is lost in darkness
	but she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read the
	map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.

				RAILLY
		Where... where are we going'

				MAN
		I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.

				RAILLY
			(startled, horrified)
		But that's... that's more than 200 miles!

				MAN
		That's why I can't walk there.  Turn
		here... I think...

	RAILLY obeys.  She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then
	boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully
	for his reaction.

	He grunts appreciatively.  Relieved, she looks in the mirror
	again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features
	are concealed by the map.

				RAILLY
		If you make me go with you, it's
		kidnapping.  That's a serious crime.
		If you let me go, you could just take
		the car and...

				MAN
		I don't know how to drive!  We went
		underground when I was nine, I told you
		that.  When you come to the corner,
		turn right.

	Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.

	He's lowered the map.  It's COLE!  Haggard, unshaven, dirty.

				RAILLY
		Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a
		locked room six years ago.

				COLE
		1989.  Six years for you.  There's the
		sign!  Right here!

	COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.

	RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.

	EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT

	The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.

	INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT

	RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily
	against the seat.  She says carefully...

				RAILLY
		I can't believe this is a coincidence,
		Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?

				COLE
		You told me you'd help me.  I know this
		isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate...
		no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.
		I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that.
		But then I saw your book in a store window
		with a notice about your lecture.
			(sudden pride)
		I can read, remember?

				RAILLY
		Yes, I remember.
			(a beat, then)
		Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?

				COLE
		It's the next step.  I checked out the
		Baltimore information, it was nothing.
		It's Philadelphia, that's where they
		are, the ones who killed everyone.
			(pointing suddenly, eagerly)
		Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?

	RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF
	and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.

				COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)
		This is a personal message to you.

	COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.

				COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		Are you at the end of your rope?  Are
		you dying to get away?

	COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.

				COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}
		The Florida Keys are waiting for you.

	COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills
	the car.  It's confusing!  He blurts out...

				COLE
		I've never seen the ocean!

	Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her
	professional tone.

				RAILLY
		It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole.  You
		do understand that, don't you?  It's
		not really a special message to you.

	COLE frowns.  He did think it was for him, but she's probably right.

				COLE
		You used to call me "James".

				RAILLY
		You'd prefer that? ... James...you
		don't really have a gun, do you.

				COLE
			(cynical laugh)
		Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...

	He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC!  FATS DOMINO singing
	"BLUEBERRY HILL"!  COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.

				COLE
		Can you...can you make it louder?  I
		love hearing twentieth century music!
		Hearing music and breathing air!

	As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror
	incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the
	wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily.

	EXT.  FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT

	"BLUEBERRY HILL" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear
	window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.

	The sign says, "PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES."

	INT.  ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT

	RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his
	head out the window.  what can she do?  Just then, while she's
	trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in...

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
		This just in from Fresno, California:
		emergency crews are converging on a
		cornfield where playmates of nine year
		old Ricky Neuman say they saw him
		disappear right before their eyes.

	COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now.

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		Young Neuman apparently stepped into an
		abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere
		in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive,
		possibly seriously injured.  Playmates claim
		they heard him cry out faintly but since then
		there has been no contact with...

				COLE
		"Never cry wolf!"

				RAILLY
		What?

				COLE
		My father told me that.  "Never cry
		wolf."  Then people won't believe you
		if...something really happens.

				RAILLY
		"If something really happens"...like
		what, James?

				COLE
		Something bad.  Is that all the music?
		I don't want to hear this stuff...

	RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.

				RAILLY
		Did something terrible happen to you when
		you were a child?  Something so bad...?

				COLE
		Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?

	It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, "SINCE I MET YOU, BABY".

				IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.)
		"Since I met you, baby,
		My whole life has changed...

	Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.

	EXT.  ACURA/FREEWAY

	COLE'S POV:  the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a
	lover's moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...

				IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
		"-- cause since I met you, baby.
		All I need is you..."

	ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.

	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

	Two POLICE OFFICERS and an anxious MARILOU MARTIN listen to an
	answering machine's message while a hungry CAT cries plaintively.

				ANSWERING MACHINE
		Dr. Railly -- this is Palmer from Psych
		Admitting.  There was a guy here this
		afternoon looking for you.  He seemed
		very agitated.  We tried to keep him, but
		he refused 'n I kept thinking, I know
		this guy.  Then, just a few minutes ago,
		it came to me.  It's Cole!  James Cole.
		Remember him?  The paranoid who pulled
		the Houdini back in '89.  Well, he's
		back and he's...cuckoo...and he's looking
		for you.  I thought you oughta know.

	The machine switches off.  The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.

				MARILOU MARTIN
		It's just as I told you -- my husband
		and I had gone ahead -- she never
		showed.  That's totally unlike her!

				OFFICER TWO
			(pulls out his notebook)
		Do you happen to know the make of her car?

				MARILOU MARTIN
		Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that
		cat's starving!  She would never neglect
		her cat!

	EXT.  MOTEL - MORNING

	The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS
	MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.

	INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46

	The TV is on.  A commercial is just starting.  A catfood jingle.

	The sound of HEAVY BREATHING.

	ANGLE ON COLE, sweating, BREATHING HEAVILY, sprawled on one side
	of the double bed, sound asleep.

	INT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)

	GUNSHOT!  YOUNG COLE glimpses the BLONDE MAN staggering, wounded.

	The mysterious BRUNETTE races past him toward the BLONDE MAN, and
	YOUNG COLE again glimpses the resemblance to RAILLY, in spite of
	the dark hair, the make-up, the flashy earrings.

	Close at hand, YOUNG COLE'S FATHER, his face still out of view, says,

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Son, it's important for your cat to
		have the nourishment necessary for
		healthy bones and a rich coat.

	INT.  MOTEL ROOM 46

	COLE comes awake with a start.  He stares, disoriented, at the
	CATFOOD COMMERCIAL on the TV.

				RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Please untie me.  I'm very uncomfortable.

	COLE turns to RAILLY, beside him on the bed, frightened and
	helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket.

	COLE'S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his
	impulse.  He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the
	dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons.  He pulls a
	razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the
	bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.

				COLE
		You were in my dream just now.  Your hair
		was different, but I'm sure it was you.

				RAILLY
		We dream about what's important in our lives.
		And I seem to have become pretty important
		in yours.  What was the dream about?

				COLE
		About an airport...before everything
		happened.  It's the same dream I always
		have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid
		in it.

				RAILLY
		And I was in it?  What did I do?

				COLE
		You were very upset.  You're always
		very upset in the dream, but I never
		knew it was you before.

				RAILLY
		It wasn't me before, James.  It's
		become me now because of...what's
		happening.  Please untie me.

	Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.

				COLE
		No, I think it was always you.  It's
		very strange.

				RAILLY
		You're flushed.  And you were moaning.
		I think you're running a fever.  What
		are you doing?

	COLE is rummaging through RAILLY'S wallet, pulling out money.

				COLE
		I'll be back in a minute.

	He heads for the door.

				RAILLY
		No!  Don't leave me here like this!

	Too late!  He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone.

	ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.

				TV ANCHORMAN
		And in Fresno, California...crews
		continue to attempt to rescue nine year
		old Ricky Neuman.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, twisting and struggling on the bed, trying to
	get loose, tears welling in her eyes.

				TV ANCHORMAN (cont. o.s.)
		The boy was playing ball with four
		other children when he literally
		disappeared off the face of the earth.

	EXT.  MOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING

	COLE puzzles over a junk food vending machine, inserts coins tentatively.

	INT.  MOTEL ROOM

	ANGLE ON TV, the picture of RAILLY filling the screen.


	----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING -----------------------


				COLE
		My notes.  Observations.  Clues.

				RAILLY
		Clues?  What kind of clues?

				COLE
		A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve
		Monkeys.  I've told you about them.
		They spread the virus.  That's why we
		have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to
		find them -- it's my assignment.

				RAILLY
		What will you do...when you find
		this...secret army?

				COLE
		I just have to locate the virus in its
		original form before it mutates.  So
		scientists can come back and study it
		and find a cure.  So that those of us
		who survived can go back to the surface
		of the earth.

	RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass
	a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back.

	COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.

				COLE
		You won't think I'm crazy next month.
		People are going to start dying.  At
		first the papers will say it's some
		weird fever, some virus.  Then they'll
		begin to catch on.  They'll get it.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		We interrupt this program with a
		special bulletin...

	RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		This report just in from Fresno,
		California.  Naval sonar specialists
		who were flown to the site...

				COLE
		I thought it was about us.  I thought
		maybe they'd found us and arrested me
		or something.

	RAILLY stares at COLE.

				COLE
		Just a joke.

				RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
		-- an hour ago have been unable to
		determine the location of the boy in the
		150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who
		lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into
		the narrow tube claims he heard breathing
		sounds coming from approximately seventy
		feet down...

	COLE reaches over and changes stations.  MUSIC again.

				RAILLY
		Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking
		about that little boy in the well?

				COLE
		When I was a kid I identified with that
		kid, down there alone in that pipe...a
		hundred feet down -- doesn't know if
		they're going to save him.

				RAILLY
		What do you mean -- when you were a kid?

				COLE
		Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a
		hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn.
		Hey, turn left here.  Left!

	COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.

	EXT.  SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY

	An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered
	bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he
	rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES.

				EVANGELIST
		"And the wild beasts of the islands
		shall cry in their desolate houses and
		dragons in their pleasant palaces:  and
		her time is near to come, and her days
		shall not be prolonged."

	ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving,
	COLE, beside her, staring out the window.

	INT.  ACURA/SKID ROW STREET

	COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store
	fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable "RESIDENTS".

				COLE
		Where I come from we think of this as Eden.
		If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown
		food.  Eden!  Look at them!  They donut
		know what they have.  They don't see the
		sky.  They don't feel the air!

	COLE'S POV:  a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING!

				COLE (o.s.)
		And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug
		they haven't a clue.  WAIT!  STOP!

	EXT.  ACURA/SKID ROW

	On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with
	graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.

	Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.

	COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang
	insignias.  We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.

				COLE
		The Twelve Monkeys!!!  They're here.
			(looks around)
		Somewhere.  Come on!

	He pulls her along the sidewalk.  No question, he's insane.

	At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly.  Then, still
	keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly
	tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.

	RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when,
	suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...

				COLE
		Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything,
		I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!

				RAILLY
		I'm not going to "do" anything, I
		promise.  But you need help, James.
		None of this is what you think it is.

	ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly!  He's found
	another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!

	But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s)
		You can't hide from them, Bob.

	COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a
	voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.

				LOUIE
		No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.
			(conspiratorially)
		They hear everything.  They got that
		tracking device on you.  They can find
		you anywhere.  Anytime.  Ha Ha!

	RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.

				LOUIE
			(touches his back jaw)
		In the tooth, Bob!  Right?
			(sudden triumphant grin)
		But I fooled 'em, old buddy!

	He opens his mouth wide.  NO TEETH'

	COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.

				COLE
		They're keeping an eye on me.

				RAILLY
		Who's keeping an eye on you?

				COLE
		The man...with the voice.  I recognized
		him.  He's from the present.  He...

	COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees...

	there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS

	And further on, another red stencil!

	EXT.  VACANT LOT - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

	CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes,
	oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.

	COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.

	RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly,
	COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.

				RAILLY
		James, no -- we shouldn't be here!

	COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.

	INT.  DARK ALLEY - DAY

	Two TOM CATS face off, arching their backs and HISSING menacingly.

	COLE avoids them as he pulls RAILLY into the gloom.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead!

	RAILLY'S POV:  TWO THUGS, standing over a MAN, kicking him.

	RAILLY tries to stop, but COLE, intent on the wall messages,
	doesn't notice the THUGS.

	The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them.

	These creeps have mean eyes, predator faces.

	RAILLY digs her heels in, forcing COLE to stop.

				RAILLY
		James!  We have to go back.  Those men...

	Too late.  While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending,
	the TWO THUGS are approaching.

				FIRST THUG
		Hey, buddy.

	Startled, COLE turns to face them.

	The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her.

	COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK!  The FIRST THUG smacks
	COLE hard across the face with something metallic.

	Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his
	head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S
	cheek.  It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol.

	RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks
	her roughly to the ground.

				SECOND THUG
		Stick around, bitch.

	Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly.
	RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES...

	COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG'S feet.

				COLE
		Please!  Please don't hurt me!

	The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his
	foot for a second kick when...

	COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger
	man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.

	The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG
	in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him.
	The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.

	Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE
	but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage
	blows that come one after another with lightning speed.  The SECOND
	THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.

	Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for
	the dropped pistol.

	COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw.  The FIRST THUG'S head whips
	back.  SNAP!  He collapses against the brick wall.

	COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley
	as fast as he can stagger.

	RAILLY stares up at COLE.  He looks very dangerous.  He glances
	in her direction as he pockets the pistol.

				COLE
		Are you hurt?

				RAILLY
		Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...

	As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the
	motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.

				RAILLY
		Is he...alive?

	COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a
	handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.

				COLE
		Come an.  We're running out of time.
		You can't help him.

	As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST
	THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.

				RAILLY
		Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!

				COLE
		I did him a favor.  Now come on.

	COLE, pulling her again, sees more "12 MONKEYS" on the wall.

				RAILLY
		You didn't have a gun before, did you?

				COLE
		I've got one now.

	EXT.  SECOND AVE - DAY

	The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him,
	points urgently at COLE.

				EVANGELIST
		You!  You!  You're one of us, aren't you?

	But COLE has stopped and is staring at...

	A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters.  The sign
	over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.

	INT.  FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

	Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired,
	and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating
	leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM.  Behind them, a large
	poster proclaims, "ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO".  Just then, there's
	a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see
	COLE and RAILLY enter.

	COLE looks startled.  It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in
	here.  Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks
	around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.

	Bookshelves line two walls.  The front window is blanked cut with
	posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings,
	photos of animal atrocities.  The fourth wall features the
	counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD
	SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.

				FALE
		Uh, can we help you?

	COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets
	an urgent warning.

				FALE
		Excuse me.  You looking for something
		in particular?

				RAILLY
		It's all right, James -- it's just a tape.

	COLE'S eyes follow her look.  It's a tape recorder underneath a
	sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD".

				COLE
		I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

	FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY.  "We have a problem!" the look says.
	MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the
	counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.

				TEDDY
		We don't know anything about any "Army
		of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't
		you and your friend disappear, okay?

	COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.

				COLE
		I just need some information...

				TEDDY
		Didn't you hear me?  We're not...

	TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.

	COLE is pointing a pistol at them.  A TIGER SNARLS.

				RAILLY
		James, no -- don't hurt them.
			(to the activists)
		Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do
		whatever he tells you to do.  He's...
		upset -- disturbed.  Please -- he's
		dangerous -- just cooperate.

	MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.

				FALE
		What do you want -- money?  We only
		have a few bucks.

	COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again.  A
	BABOON HOWLS with laughter.

				COLE
		I told you what I want.
			(snaps at Railly)
		Lock the door!

				RAILLY
		James, why don't we...?

				COLE
		Lock it now!

	RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,

				BEN
		I told you that fuckhead Mason would
		get us into something like this.

				FALE
		Shut up!

				COLE
		Mason???

				RAILLY
		Jeffrey Mason?

				BEN
		Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.

	INT.  FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)

	The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of
	the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement.  They're very
	frightened, eager to cooperate.

				FALE
		Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big
		star -- the media latch on to him
		because he's picketing his own father,
		a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist".
		You musta seen all that on TV.

				COLE
		No, I don't watch TV.

	COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while
	RAILLY watches helplessly.  Suddenly, COLE finds something he
	thinks he's seen before.  He holds it up.

				COLE
		Is this him -- Dr. Mason?

	It's a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a
	phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.

				FALE
		That's him.

				BEN
			(very frightened)
		What are you going to do with us?

				COLE
			(stares at the photo, then)
		Tell me more about Jeffrey.

				FALE
			(a helpless shrug to his cohorts)
		Jeffrey started getting bored with the
		shit we do...picketing, leafleting,
		letter-writing stuff.  He said we were,
		"ineffectual liberal jerkoffs".  He
		wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to
		"educate" the public.

	COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on
	their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.

				FALE
		Yeah, that's when he let a hundred
		snakes loose in the Senate.

				TEDDY
		But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
		It's counter productive, we told him.

				FALE
		So he and eleven others split off and
		became this underground..."army"

				COLE
		The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.

				BEN
		They started planning a "Human Hunt".

				TEDDY
		They bought stun guns and nets and bear
		traps.  They were gonna go to Wall
		Street and trap lawyers and bankers...

				BEN
		But they didn't do it.  They didn't do
		any of it.

				TEDDY
		Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot
		sold his friends out!

				COLE
		What's that mean?

				FALE
		He goes on TV, gives a news conference,
		tells the whole world he just realized
		his daddy's experiments are vital for
		humanity and that the use of animals is
		absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey
		Mason, from now on, is going to personally
		supervise the labs to make sure all the
		little animals aren't going to suffer.

				COLE
			(holding up a rolodex)
		What's this?

	EXT.  FREEWAY - AFTERNOON

	In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with
	bumper stickers and painted slogans.  "I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS"...
	"FREE THE ANIMALS"..."WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?"

				RAILLY (v.o.)
		You can't just barge in on a famous
		scientist.  They'll have security guards,
		gates, alarm systems.  It's insane, James.

	INT.  MOVING FORD/FREEWAY

	A ROLODEX CARD with an address on "Outerbridge Road" for "Jeffrey
	Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason" rests on a map spread across COLE'S
	lap.  COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY'S at the wheel,
	maneuvering in heavy traffic.

				RAILLY
		If those young men don't get loose,
		they could die in that basement.

	COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing
	cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.

				COLE
		All I see are dead people.  Everywhere.
		What's three more?

				RAILLY
			(a beat, carefully, a new tack)
		You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey
		Mason, don't you, James?  You met him
		in the County Hospital six years ago.

	COLE is studying the map again.

				COLE
		The guy was a total fruitcake.

				RAILLY
		And he told you then his father was a
		famous virologist.

	COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing "Outerbridge Road".

				COLE
		No -- he said his father was "God"!

	EXT./INT.  FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)

	The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open
	highway.  COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving
	the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well.  As
	the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside.  An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	intones over the RADIO...

				RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)
		This just in:  police are widening
		their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,
		prominent psychiatrist and author.
		Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has
		been abducted by escaped mental patient,
		James Cole. The two are believed to be
		traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura,
		license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.

	RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain.  She feels so badly for
	him.  She wants to help him.  She says, tenderly...

				RAILLY
		This can't go on, James.  You're not
		well.  You're burning with fever.

	COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.

				COLE
		We need gas.

				RAILLY
		I thought you didn't know how to drive.

				COLE
		I said I was too young to drive.  I
		didn't say I was stupid.

				RAILLY
		What's the matter with your leg?

				COLE
		I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas
		station up ahead.

				RAILLY
		Shot!  Who shot you?

				COLE
		It was some kind of...war.  Never mind,
		you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.

	INT.  PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)

	The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY
	remain in the car.  She's pulling a gas card from her wallet.

				COLE
		You were going to run out off gas on
		purpose, weren't you?

				RAILLY
		No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James --
		It'll go much better for you if you do
		-- but I'm not going to trick you.

				COLE
			(sees the credit card)
		That has your name on it.  Give him cash.

	RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as
	the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.

	RAILLY starts opening the door.  Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.

				COLE
		Where are you going?

	She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience
	Store appended to the Gas Station.

				RAILLY
		You can come with me.  I have to get
		some things.  Scissors, bandages, some
		alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look
		at your leg, James.  I'm a doctor.

	COLE looks helpless, hesitant.  She's in charge...for the moment.

	EXT.  CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)

	The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves.  We HEAR the CAR
	RADIO but not the engine.

				RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
		Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining
		engineers continue their desperate
		attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the
		ant in which nine year old...

	COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the
	Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door.  He's staring up
	at the sun and the sky.  RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.

				RAILLY
		You shouldn't put your weight on it.
		You need stitches and antibiotics.
		Lucky for you it was near the surface.

	RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket
	while COLE continues staring up at the sky.

				COLE
		I love seeing the sun.

	A beat.  COLE tries to stand up.

				RAILLY
		Wait -- let me help you.

	RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet.  A beat.
	They're very close.  They don't move.  RAILLY looks like she can
	barely breathe.

				COLE
			(leans closer, shuts his eyes)
		You smell so good.

				RAILLY
			(trying to concentrate)
		You have to give yourself up, you know.

	A beat.  The spell is broken.  He reaches for his pants, then
	turns back to her, suddenly grim.

				COLE
		I have to do something now.  Something
		I don't want to do.  I'm so sorry.

	RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes.  He looms over her.  He's
	cold now, steeled.

				COLE
		I have a mission.  It's important.

	RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.

	EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT

	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury
	cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion.  Encountering
	another AGENT, he pauses.

				FIRST AGENT
		They find him?

				SECOND AGENT
		Who??

				FIRST AGENT
		That kid.  The one in the pipe.

				SECOND AGENT
		You believe this?  They're dropping a monkey
		down there with a miniature infra-red camera
		strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich
		wrapped in tinfoil.

				FIRST AGENT
		You're making that up!

	ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to
	the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.

				SECOND AGENT (o.s.)
		I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!
		A monkey and a sandwich.  Wonder who
		thought that one up.

				FIRST AGENT (o.s.)
		Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel
		Prize!

	Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it.  He doesn't
	see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.

	INT.  MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	A formal dinner for forty.  Desert has been served.  DR. MALCOLM
	MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.

				DR. MASON
		Would that I could enjoy this opulent
		dinner and this excellent and
		stimulating company for itself, with no
		sense of purpose.  But alas, I am
		"burdened" with the sense that with all
		this excess of public attention and
		this cacophony of praise, there comes
		great responsibility.  Indeed, I
		practically feel a soapbox growing
		under my feet whenever I stand for more
		than a few seconds.

	While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE
	AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.

				DR. MASON (o.s.)
		The dangers of science are a time worn
		threat, from Prometheus stealing fire
		from the Gods to the Cold War era of
		the Dr. Strangelove Terror.

	AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for.  JEFFREY MASON!

				DR. MASON (cont.)
		But never before, not even at Los Alamos
		when the scientists made bets on whether
		their first atomic bomb test would wipe out
		New Mexico, has science given us so much
		reason to fear the power we have at hand.

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.

				JEFFREY
		What are you talking about?  What
		friend?  I'm not expecting anyone.

	ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.

				DR. MASON
		Current genetic engineering as well as
		my own work with viruses has presented
		us with powers as terrifying as any...

	ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room,
	grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.

				JEFFREY
		This is ridiculous.  My father is
		making a major address.

	INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION

	The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.

				AGENT #3
		Normally if we caught a guy sneaking
		around like this with no I.D., we'd
		bust his ass, excuse the French, but
		this one said he knows you...
			(smirk, smirk)
		-- and, since you seem to have had
		some...uh...unusual...uh..."associates",
		we certainly didn't want to arrest one
		of your, uh, closest...pals.

	INT.  LIBRARY/MASON MANSION

	COLE, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in
	a wingback chair, looks up as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the
	room.  A FOURTH AGENT looms beside the wingback chair.

				JEFFREY
			(dismissing Cole casually)
		Never saw him before in my life.  Go
		ahead and shoot him or torture him or
		whatever it is you do.

				COLE
			(rising)
		You do know me.  You helped me once.

				JEFFREY
			(turning to leave)
		That would be totally out of character.
		Helping people is against my principles.
			(to the Agents)
		See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now,
		I'm going to go back and listen to my
		father's very eloquent discourse on the
		perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS
		INTRUDER TO DEATH.

				COLE
		I'm here about some monkeys.

	Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes.  A beat.

				JEFFREY
		Excuse me -- what did you say?

				COLE
		Monkeys.  Twelve of them.

	JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE.  Then, suddenly, JEFFREY
	rushes to COLE and embraces him.

				JEFFREY
		Arnold...Arnold.

	COLE is astonished.  The AGENTS are, too.

				JEFFREY
			(stepping back)
		My God, Arnie, what's happened to you?
		You look like shit

				AGENT #3
			(dubious)
		You know this man?

				JEFFREY
		Of course I know him.  What do you
		think -- I act like this to strangers?
		Listen -- you fellas are terrific.  I
		thought you were pulling a number on
		me.  What a terrible thing if you'd
		thrown old Arnie out.  I owe you guys
		the big apologia!  Mea culpa, fellas.
			(turning to Cole)
		Christ, Arnie, it's black tie!  I mean,
		I said, "drop by," but, like, this is
		Dad's big "do"...vips, senators, secret
		service, and...and everything.

	JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading
	him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.

				AGENT #4
		"Arnie?"

				JEFFREY
		Arnold Pettibone.  Old Arnie Pettibone.
		Used to be my best friend.  Still is.
		What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?
		No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry?
		Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig.
		Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.

	The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.

				AGENT #4
		These people -- all of 'em -- are true
		weirdoes!

				AGENT #3
			(moving to the phone)
		I'm gonna call in a description of this
		"Pettibone" character.  You go keep an
		eye on him.  Make sure he doesn't do
		one of the guests with a fork.

	INT.  HALLWAY/MASON MANSION

	GUESTS pouring from the dining room into the hall meet JEFFREY
	and a very disconcerted COLE.

				JEFFREY
		Hey, nice ta see ya.  Lookin' good!  Hi,
		there.  Yes, it has been a long time.

	In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and
	COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.

				JEFFREY
			(whispers to Cole)
		County Hospital, right?  1989.  The
		"Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?
			(smiling to guests)
		Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.

				COLE
		Listen to me -- I can't do anything
		about what you're going to do. I can't
		change anything.  I can't stop you.  I
		just want some information...

				JEFFREY
		We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.
			(to a guest)
		I am a new person!  I'm completely
		adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.
			(whispers to Cole)
		Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?

				COLE
		I just need to have access to the pure
		virus, that's all!  For the future!

	JEFFREY studies COLE.  COLE doesn't just talk crazy.  He looks crazy!

				JEFFREY
		Come on, follow me.  You don't lock so good.

	JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing
	back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.

				COLE
		I don't have time to go upstairs.  The
		police are looking for me.  I need to
		know where it is and exactly what it is.

				JEFFREY
			(brightening suddenly)
		I get it!  This is your old plan, right?

				COLE
		Plan?  What are you talking about?

				JEFFREY
		Remember?  We were in the dayroom,
		watching TV, and you were all upset
		about the...desecration of the planet.
		And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be
		great if there was a germ or a virus
		that could wipe out mankind and leave
		the plants and animals just as they
		are?"  You do remember that, don't you?

				COLE
		Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!

				JEFFREY
		And that's when I told you my father was
		this famous virologist and you said, "Hey,
		he could make a germ and we could steal it!"

				COLE
			(grabbing Jeffrey)
		Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates
		We live underground!  The world belongs
		to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're
		like moles or worms.  All we want to do
		is study the original...

				AGENT #4'S VOICE
		Okay -- take it easy.  We know who you
		are, Mr. Cole.

	COLE feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees AGERT #4

				AGENT #4
		Let's go somewhere and talk this thing
		over. Okay? Just come with me...

				JEFFREY
		You're right!  Absolutely right.  Me's
		a nut case, totally deranged.  Delusional!
		Paranoid.  HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED
		UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.

	AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD
	AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.

	COLE is like a trapped animal. He's being led down the staircase
	now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.

				JEFFREY
		YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE "ARMY OF THE
		TWELVE MONKEYS"?  IT'S A COLLECTION OF
		NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN.
		SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN
		FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
		THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE
		RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF
		INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR
		GRAND PLOT!

	COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the
	stairs.  It sounds true!  JEFFREY'S so confident.

				AGENT #3
		Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him.
		Everything's...

				JEFFREY
		MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT
		THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH
		VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE
		"PROCESSED" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH
		YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND
		LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE
		"ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS" BECOMES
		SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY
		CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU
		KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???

	Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free,
	shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.

	INT.  FOYER/MASON MANSION

	COLE heads for the front door, but there's an AGENT there!  COLE
	turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way
	through the crowd of amazed GUESTS.

	INT.  DINING ROOM/MASON MANSION

	SERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS
	burst into the room.

				AGENT #4
		Did a man just come through here...limping?

	INT.  KITCHEN/MASON MANSION

	COOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen
	and look about urgently.

	INT.  DEN/MASON MANSION

	A large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in
	front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		These pictures we are seeing are coming
		to us live from deep inside the pipe.
		You can just make out the metal wall
		behind those roots and I guess those
		must be spider webs.

	MRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern...

				MRS. McCANN
		Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey
		is going to eat the sandwich himself.

	Just then, two AGENTS burst into the den.

	The GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but
	the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it.

	AGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW:  the rows of expensive parked CARS.

	ON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY'S photograph appears.

				TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
		This just in:  Police say that the body of
		a woman found strangled in the Knutson state
		Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly.

	As the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY'S abandoned
	Acura comes up on the TV screen.

				TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
		Earlier in the day, police located
		Railly's abandoned car not far from a
		building where three animal rights
		activists were found bound and gagged...

	EXT.  MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)

	Pistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked
	luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles.

				AN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.)
		COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING
		TO HURT YOU.

	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR

	COLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver's seat,
	spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head
	slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out.

	EXT.  PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION

	AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.

	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR

	COLE eases himself into the driver's seat, tentatively slides the
	shift into "Drive", then turns the key.  Nothing happens.

	Panic.  COLE studies the shift again.

	EXT.  PARKED CARS/MANSION

	AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.

	INT.  PARKED GREEN JAGUAR

	COLE slides the shift from D (Drive) to N (Neutral).  He twists
	the key again.  The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM!

	EXT.  LAWN/MANSION

	AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.

	SMASH.  The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and
	accelerates right at him!

	AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past
	him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between
	two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.

	INT.  MOVING JAGUAR

	Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.

	The JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH...

	COLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight.  Steering madly,
	he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway.

	EXT.  MASON MANSION - NIGHT

	Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.

	AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life,
	its rotors whipping around.

	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR/OUTERHRIDGE ?OAD - NIGHT

	COLE turns onto the road, careening crazily from one side to the
	other, unable to see ahead with no headlights.

				COLE
		LIGHTS!  LIGHTS!

	He starts hitting switches.  The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES.

				RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
		---when they pulled the monkey out, it
		was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped
		sandwich.

	Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE.

	COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.

	Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.

	INT.  FLYING HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	The PILOT, an agent, steers the chopper while the CO-PILOT pans a
	spotlight over the two lane road beneath them.

	Just then, the PILOT sees headlights below.

				PILOT
		There!  He's showing lights.

	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR - NIGHT

	COLE can see the road now in his headlights as the windshield
	wipers scrape frantically and the RADIO BLARES...

				RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
		We don't know what to think.  They
		didn't locate him and they don't know
		how much longer he can last, that's
		assuming the boy is still alive.

	A spotlight hits the car and COLE hears the sound of the
	HELICOPTER as it lowers over him!

	EXT.  OUTERBRIDGE ROAD

	The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.

	INT.  SPEEDING JAGUAR

	COLE can see the underbelly of the HELICOPTER a few feet above
	his front windshield.

	Desperate, he yanks the wheel hard, veering off the road.

	COLE'S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:  dense woods ahead.

	EXT.  HELICOPTER/WOODS

	The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.

	INT.  HELICOPTER

	The PILOT skims the top of the trees while the CO-PILOT rakes the
	forest below with his spotlight.

				PILOT
		Goddamnit!  Where is he?

	The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.

				CO-PILOT
		There!  Over there.

				PILOT
		Where?
				CO-PILOT
		Eight o'clock!  He was right there.

	The headlights are gone.  Nothing but darkness below.

				PILOT
		He musta turned his lights of if.

				CO-PILOT
		Couldn't drive down there without
		lights.  We just can't see 'em.

				PILOT
		Maybe he's not driving!

	EXT.  WOODS - LATER (NIGHT)

	A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar,
	crumpled into a tree, the driver's door open.

	A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as
	OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.

	The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the
	Jaguar.  He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...
 
				POLICE OFFICER
		He's not in here.

	EXT.  WOODS/CLEARING - NIGHT

	Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through
	underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.

	Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.

	The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees
	beside the stream.  The car looks empty.

	INT.  TRUNK/FORD

	Total blackness!  The sound of keys in the lock.

	Then, the trunk swings open and COLE stands in the moonlight,
	looking down

	RAILLY is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.

				RAILLY
		You bastard!  You total bastard!

	EXT.  FORD

	COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.

	He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.

				RAILLY
		I could have died in there.  If something
		had happened to you I would have died.

	COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.

				COLE
		I...I...I'm really sorry.

	Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.

				RAILLY
		What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?

				COLE
			(getting to his feet)
		No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car
		and they chased me.  I hit a tree.

				RAILLY
		See -- you can drive after all!

				COLE
		Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry
		I locked you up.  I thought...I thought...
		I think maybe I am crazy!

	She looks at him.  Breakthrough?  Very calm now, the doctor.

				RAILLY
		What made you think that?

				COLE
		Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about
		the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't
		sure.  We talked when I was in the
		institution, and it was all...fuzzy.
		The drugs and stuff.
			(horrified)
		You think maybe I'm the one who wiped
		out the human race?  It was my idea?

				RAILLY
		Nobody is going to wipe out the human
		race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody
		else.  You've created something in your
		mind, James -- a substitute reality.
		In order to avoid something you don't
		want to face.

				COLE
		I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would
		love to believe that.

				RAILLY
		It can be dealt with, but only if you
		want to.  I can help you.

	COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.

				COLE
		I need help all right.  They're coming
		after me.

				RAILLY
		First, it's important that you
		surrender to them instead of them
		catching you running.  Okay?

				COLE
			(brightening)
		It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm
		wrong about everything...the world will be
		okay.  I'll never have to live underground.

				RAILLY
		Give me the gun.

				COLE
		The gun! ... I lost it

				RAILLY
		You're sure?

				COLE
			(showing her)
		No gun!
			(looking up)
		Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!

	RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.

				RAILLY
		I'm going to attract their attention,
		let them know where we are, okay?

	RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn.

				RAILLY
			(calling out)
		They'll tell you to put your hands on top
		of your head.  Do what they tell you.  You're
		going to get better, James -- I know it!

	ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground.  An insect!  He
	reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass,
	stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face.  The
	HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.

	ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.

	ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.

				COLE
		I love this world!

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS
	from the woods.  The police are almost here.  She gets out of the
	car, starts around toward COLE.

				RAILLY
		Remember, I'm going to help you.  I'll
		stay with you.  I won't let them...

	She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!

	COLE is gone.  Disappeared.

	INT.  POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING

	RAILLY is being "debriefed" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS.

				RAILLY
		Then I said something to him about
		cooperating and he said he would do
		that, so I got in the car and started
		honking the horn.  When I got out, he
		was gone.

				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
		You lucked out.  For a while we thought
		you were a body they found down state...
		mutilated.

	A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.

				RAILLY
		He wouldn't do something like that -- he...

				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
			(interrupts, hands her the photo)
		This the man he attacked?

	RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped
	against the alley wall, obviously dead.

				RAILLY
		I'd like to be clear about this.  That
		man and the other one were..."severely"
		beating us.  James Cole didn't start
		it.  In fact -- he saved me!

				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
		Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can
		explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist
		-- why do kidnap victims almost always
		try to tell us about the guys who grabbed
		'em and try to make us understand how
		kind these bastards really were?

				RAILLY
			(as if reciting)
		It's a normal reaction to a life-
		threatening situation.
			(suddenly animated)
		He's sick.  He thinks he comes from the
		future.  He's been living in a carefully
		constructed fantasy world and that world
		is starting to disintegrate.  He needs
		help!

	INT.  AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM

	YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide.

	He sees the BRUNETTE, cradling the head of the BLONDE MAN as he
	sprawls on the concourse...

				ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Wake up! Wake up!

				GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I think we gave him too much.

				MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
		WAKE UP, PRISONER!

	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE blinks awake. All he can see are blurry faces hovering over
	him, hammering him with questions.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Come on, Cole, cooperate!

				GEOLOGIST
		Spit it out... you went to the home of
		a famous virologist...

				COLE
			(weakly)
		You...don't...exist!  You're in
		my mind...

				SCIENTISTS (IN RAPID SUCCESSION)
		What?  What's that?  What did he say?  His
		brain's fried.  Give him another shot!
		SPEAK UP, COLE.  WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?

	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT - EVENING

	The TV shows film of RAILLY leaving the police station.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		The kidnap victim seemed exhausted but
		apparently unharmed by her 30 hour ordeal
		as she left the police station in
		Philadelphia this morning.  So far she
		has refused to make a public statement.

	RAILLY'S friends, MARILOU and WAYNE, are watching the TV.

	A door opens and KATHRYN RAILLY, wearing a robe, comes out of her
	bedroom.  She still looks exhausted   Followed by her cat, she
	enters the kitchen area and turns on the kettle as WAYNE hastily
	turns down the TV.

				WAYNE
		Sorry.

				RAILLY
		No -- I'm in a state of hyper-
		alertness.  I can't sleep.

				MARILOU
		Did you take the sedative?

				RAILLY
		I hate those things.  They mess my head
		up.

	The old mug shot of COLE appears on the screen and RAILLY remotes
	the volume up.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		Along with the kidnapping of the Baltimore
		woman, James Cole is now also wanted in
		connection with the brutal slaying of
		Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from...

	RAILLY goes to the window, pushes aside the drape, and sees...

	HER POV:  ACROSS THE STREET...A COP keeps watch.

				RAILLY (o.s.)
		Do they really expect him to come here?

	RAILLY returns to the kitchen area where MARILOU is getting the
	tea things out.

				TV REPORTER on air
		And in Fresno, California...

				RAILLY
			(glances sadly toward the TV)
		He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?

				WAYNE
		He's fine.  It was just a "prank" he
		and his friends pulled.

	CLOSE ON RAILLY'S FACE... SHOCKED.

	ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, showing footage of a sheepish nine year
	old boy being led out of a barn by the police.  The cops look grim.

				TV REPORTER (v.o.)
		Authorities have so far been noncommittal
		about whether they will try to file
		charges against the families of the
		children involved in the hoax.

	RAILLY stares at the TV, stunned.

	INT.  "HOSPITAL" ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT

	VOICES!  SINGING!  COLE blinks awake, looks around, confused, then
	stares in disbelief....

	Crowded around COLE'S bed, the SCIENTISTS are concluding a
	ragged, out of tune, rendition of "BLUEBERRY HILL."

				SCIENTISTS
		---found my thrills on Blueberry Hill...

	Seeing he's awake, SCIENTISTS break off the song and applaud.

				SCIENTISTS
		Well done, James!  Well done!  Nice
		going!  Congratulations!  Good for you!

				BOTANIST
		During your "interview," while you
		were..."under the influence," you told
		us you liked music!

	COLE, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one-bed windowless
	room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century
	landscapes.

	The BOTANIST responds to COLE'S obvious disbelief with a
	friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.

				ZOOLOGIST
		This isn't the prison, James.

				BOTANIST
		This is a hospital.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		But just until you recover your,
		uh,... equilibrium.

				ENGINEER
		You're still a little... disoriented.

				GEOLOGIST
		Stress!  Time travel!

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		You stood up very well, considering...

				GEOLOGIST
		Superior work!  Superior!

				BOTANIST
		You connected the Army of the 12
		Monkeys to a world famous virologist
		and his son...

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		Others will take over now...

				ZOOLOGIST
		We'll be back on the surface in a
		matter of months....

				GEOLOGIST
		We'll retake the planet.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We're very close!  Because of you!

				ENGINEER
			(unrolling a document)
		This is it, James...what you've been
		working for.

				BOTANIST
		A full pardon!

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		You'll be out of here in no time.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Women will want to get to know you...

				COLE
		I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU
		BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!

	Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break
	through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the
	loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
			(sympathetically)
		Of course you want to be well, James.
		And you will be...soon.

	COLE bursts into hysterical laughter.

				COLE
		YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS!
		YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T
		TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE.
		MADE YOU UP!  YOU CAN'T TRICK ME!
		YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND
		YOU'RE MY INSANITY!

	INT.  PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

	CLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone,

				RAILLY
		He not only used the word "prank" -- he
		said the boy was hiding in a barn.

	RAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist
	sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.

				DR. FLETCHER
		He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him
		murder someone.  You knew there was a real
		possibility he would kill you, too.  You
		were under tremendous emotional stress.

				RAILLY
		For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he
		knew about the boy in Fresno and he says
		three billion people are going to die!

				DR. FLETCHER
		Kathryn, you know he can't possibly
		know that.  You're a rational person.
		You're a trained psychiatrist.  You
		know the difference between what's real
		and what's not.

				RAILLY
		And what we believe is what's accepted as
		"truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry --
		it's the latest religion.  And we're the
		priests -- we decide what's right and what's
		wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ...
		I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.

	INT. "HOSPITAL" CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Alone in his "hospital" room, COLE struggles without success to
	free himself from his restraints.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You sure fucked up, Bob!

	Startled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and
	continues his feverish struggle.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		But I can understand you don't want
		your mistakes pointed out to you. I can
		relate to that, old Bob.

	COLE looks around in spite of himself.  Nothing to see but the
	walls and the landscape paintings.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Hey, I know what you're thinking.  You're
		thinking I don't exist except in your
		head.  I can see that point of view.  But
		you could still talk to me, couldn't you?
		Carry on a decent conversation?

				COLE
			(blurting)
		I saw you! In 1995!  In the real world!
		You were a bum!  You pulled out your teeth.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?
		They don't like that.  That's a no-no.
		And when did you say you saw me?
		In...1872?

				COLE
		FUCK YOU!

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Yelling won't get you what you want.  You
		have to be smart to get what you want.

				COLE
		Oh, yeah?  What do I want?

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		You don't know what you want?  Sure you
		do, Bob.  You know what you want.

	COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth.  Then...

				COLE
		Tell me.  Tell me what I want.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to
		be topside -- breathe the air -- to be
		with her. ... Isn't that right?  Isn't
		that what you want?

	Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment.  When he
	speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper.

				COLE
		More...than...anything.

	INT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	RAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream.  Suddenly, the
	bedside phone RINGS.  Her eyes snap open.  A beat to orient
	herself.  RING.  She reaches for the phone.

	INTERCUT LIEUTENANT HALPERIN'S OFFICE/RAILLY'S BEDROOM

	CLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone.

				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
		Dr. Railly?  Jim Halperin, Philly P.D..
		Sorry to call so early but...

	CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone,

				RAILLY
		You found him?  Is he all right?

	CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows
	giving an "I told you so" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop
	across his desk, then continuing into the phone,

				LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
		Au contraire, Doctor.  No sign of your
		good friend, the kidnapper.  However,
		the plot thickens.  I have a ballistic
		report on my desk that says the bullet
		you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's
		thigh is an antique...and all indications
		are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned.

	ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,

				LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
		So what I was thinking was, maybe if I
		sent a detective down there to talk
		with you, you could maybe revise or
		amplify on the circumstances....
		Hello?  Hello?  Dr. Railly?

	HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.

	INT.  RAILLY'S BEDROOM/STUDY

	Her hand still on the receiver, RAILLY looks shocked.  Then, she
	hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly
	arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she
	finds a copy of her book.  She leafs through it hurriedly,
	locates the picture of the Puerto Rican KID (JOSE) in WWI.

	Peering closely, she tries to see everything in the picture.
	Then, she turns and reaches for a research folder of old
	photographs and rummages through it until she finds...!!!

				RAILLY
		No!

	It's an uncropped shot of JOSE being carried on the stretcher in
	the trenches.  And there in the corner with no helmet, no gas
	mask, and just a bit of bare shoulder showing...it's COLE!!!

	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	Clean shaven, clear eyed, COLE sits before the frowning SCIENTISTS.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		The food, the sky, the certain, uh,
		sexual temptations -- you haven't
		become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To
		that "dying" world'

				COLE
		No, sir!  I just want to do my part.
		To get us back on top...in charge of
		the planet.  And I have the experience,
		I know who the people are...

				BIOLOGIST
		He really is the most qualified...

				GEOLOGIST
		But all that..."behavior"...

				ASTROPHYSICIST
			(to Cole, a little hurt)
		You said we weren't "real," Cole...

				COLE
		Well, sir, I don't think the human mind
		was built to exist in two different...
		whatever you call it..."dimensions."
		It's stressful, you said it yourselves,
		it gets you confused.  You don't know
		what's real and what's not.

				MICROBIOLOGIST
		But you know what's real now?

				COLE
		Yes, sir.

	The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves

				GEOLOGIST
		He'd have to bone up, catch up to our
		research, the latest clues...

				ZOOLOGIST
		He's proved to be a quick study...

	The ASTROPHYSICIST fixes COLE with a sharp, penetrating look.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		You can't trick us, you know.  It
		wouldn't work.

				BIOLOGIST
		And why would you want to?  It'll be
		dangerously close to the end.

				COLE
		I understand.  There'd be no point.

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		We're going to think about it, Cole.
		Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.

	INT.  DR. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY

	Standing in front of a wall of glass in his office, overlooking a
	hi-tech lab below where WORKERS in white "space suits" work
	methodically, DR. MASON speaks angrily into a phone.  His male
	ASSISTANT, whose features we don't see, stops writing a formula
	on a blackboard and listens.

				DR. MASON
		You have reason to believe that my son
		may be planning to do what?!!!

	INT.  RAILLY'S APARTMENT/STUDY

	RAILLY, trying to stay calm, is talking to Dr. Mason on the phone.

				RAILLY
		Please, I know it sounds insane but...

	INT.  DR. MASON'S OFFICE

	Dr. Mason on the phone.

				DR. MASON
			(into the phone)
		I'm afraid this doesn't seem very
		professional to me, in fact it's
		distressingly unprofessional for some-
		one who treated my son briefly (if
		indeed you actually are who you say you
		are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest
		in his mental health six years later,
		and to telephone a parent to express
		opinions that would be inappropriate...
			(breaks off, listens, then)
		I don't know anything about "Monkey
		armies", Doctor.  Nothing whatsoever.
		If my son ever was involved in...
			(listens, then,)
		It would be doubly inappropriate to
		discuss matters of security with you,
		Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at
		ease, neither my son nor any other
		unauthorized person has access to any
		potentially dangerous organisms in this
		laboratory.  Thank you for your concern.

	DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares.

				DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
		Dr. "Kathryn" Railly????

				DR. MASON
		The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by
		that man who broke into my house.  She
		seems to have been suddenly struck by
		the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.

				DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
		I attended a lecture once...Apocalyptic
		visions.

	We see Dr. Mason's ASSISTANT now.  It's DR. PETERS, the red-
	haired man who insisted to Dr. Railly you didn't have to be
	insane to think the world was coming to an end.

				DR. PETERS (cont.)
		Has she succumbed to her own
		theoretical..."disease"?

	But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.

				DR. MASON
		Given the nature of our work, we can't ever
		be careful enough.  I think we should review
		our security procedures, perhaps upgrade them.

	INT.  SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT

	COLE is facing the BOTANIST who's using a pointer to indicate
	various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall.

				BOTANIST
		Let's consider again our current
		information -- if the symptoms were
		first detected in Philadelphia on June
		28, 1995, that makes us know that...?

				COLE
		It was released in Philadelphia,
		probably on June 14, 1995.

				BOTANIST
		And it appeared sequentially after that
		in...?

	With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him
	from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,

				COLE
		San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de
		Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
		Bangkok, then Peking.

				BOTANIST
		Meaning...???

				COLE
		That the virus was taken from Philadelphia
		to San Francisco, then to New Orleans,
		Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
		Bangkok, then Peking.

				BOTANIST
		And your only goal is...???

				COLE
		To find out where the virus is so a
		qualified scientist can travel back into
		the past and study the original virus.

				BOTANIST
		So that...???

				COLE
		Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed
		that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim
		the surface of the earth.

	COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the
	BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects...

	a magazine photo of wall graffiti:  "ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE
	WATCHING!  IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE SOURCE?  3 BILLION DIE?"

				BOTANIST (o.s.)
		This is from a magazine printed in late
		September, 1995.  The writer speculated
		that this graffiti might be related to
		the epidemic that by that time had
		already killed thirty million people
		world-wide and was getting worse.  He
		says, certain people, unnamed, were
		questioned, but what came of that is not
		known.  But it is a clue you should pursue.

	COLE stares at the picture.

	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT - DAY

	LOUD BANGING!  The storefront window, completely covered with
	posters, quivers violently.  Images of MONKEYS covered with
	electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into
	tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window.  It's RAILLY.

				RAILLY
		IS ANYBODY IN THERE?  HELLO?  IS
		SOMEONE IN THERE?  IF YOU'RE IN THERE,
		I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

	INT.  FAA STORE

	JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY
	and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons
	as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters.

				FALE
		It's the kidnap woman -- the one who
		was with the guy who tied us up.

				BEN
		What's she doing?

				FALE
		She's drawing attention to us, that's
		what she's doing. ... I don't know what
		you're up to this time, Mason, but
		you're gonna get us in deep shit!

				JEFFREY
		Whine, whine, whine.  What about walkie
		talkies?  We used to have walkie talkies.

	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT

	From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she,
	seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door.

				RAILLY
		I SAW YOU!  I SAW SOMEONE MOVING.  I
		KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

				RASPY VOICE (o.s)
		Secret experiments!

	RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.

				LOUIE
		That's what they do -- secret weird stuff!

				RAILLY
		You!  I know you!

	But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.

				LOUIE
		Not just on them.  Do 'em on people,
		too -- down at the shelters.  Feed 'em
		chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em.

				RAILLY
		Have you seen James Cole?  The man...?

				LOUIE
		They're watchin' you.  Takin' pictures.

	RAILLY follows his look.

	ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES
	COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.

				RAILLY
		The police.  I know.  Listen, I need to
		talk to James, but he has to be careful
		how he contacts me.  He mustn't get
		caught.  Do you understand me?

				LOUIS
		Uh, yeah, sure.  Uh...who's James?

				RAILLY
		He was with me, he spoke to you.
		Several weeks ago.  He said you were
		from the future...watching him.

	LOUIS gives her a look that says, "I'm outta here!"

	But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously
	"tagging" their way along the street with cans of spray paint.

	RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.

	INT.  FAA STORE

	FALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY,
	and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening
	between posters at the front window.

				JEFFREY
		You get the bolt cutters?

				KWESKIN
		One dozen.  They're in the van.

				FALE
		One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you
		gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?

				JEFFREY
			(grins)
		You really want to know?

				FALE
		No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.

				BEN
		Hey!  Do you know what she's doing?

	Everybody freezes, looking toward 3EN, who's peeking outside.

	Then, except for JEFFREY, they all crowd around BEN to get a look.

	POV THROUGH SLIT:  a glimpse of RAILLY, spray painting the front
	of the store!

				TEDDY
		What's it say?

				BEN
		I can't see it.

				JEFFREY
			(erupting)
		WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN
		PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT
		HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.

				FALE
			(spinning around)
		Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say,
		"your psychiatrist"?

				JEFFREY
		Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about
		flashlights?  How many flashlights...?

				FALE
		That woman is...was...your...
		psychiatrist?  And now she's spray-
		painting our building?

	EXT.  FAA STOREFRONT/SECOND AVENUE

	ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY,
	amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting.  He shakes his head wearily.

	ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with
	amazement, too.  They include...

	an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated...

	a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear...

	an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye...

	the TEENAGED PUNKS...

	a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS,
	reacting at the sight of RAILLY.  It's COLE!  He pushes toward her.

				COLE
		Kathryn!

	RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.

				RAILLY
		James!

	With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes
	urgent charge of the situation.

				RAILLY
		James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend
		you don't know me.  If he sees you...

				COLE
			(turning, looking)
		No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?
			(placing his hands on his head)
		Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm
		not crazy any more!  I mean, I am
		crazy, mentally divergent, actually,
		but I know it now and I want you to
		help me.  I want to get well...

	ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as
	she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.

				RAILLY
		James -- put your hands down and listen
		to me.  Things have changed!

	ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on
	his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike:  she
	tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull
	him along...but COLE isn't moving.  He's staring at the front of
	the FAA Store with disbelief!

				RAILLY
		James, come on!  We have to get out of here!

	COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk,
	then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:

			ATTENTION!!!  POLICE ARE WATCHING!
			IS THERE A VIRUS?  IS THIS THE
			SOURCE?  THREE BILLION DIE?

	It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!

				COLE
		I've seen that...before.

	But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.

				RAILLY
		James, trust me.  We're in terrible
		trouble.  We have to run.

	Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past
	ONLOOKERS.  She looks crazier than he does.

	ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost
	colliding with a passing car.  BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.

	INT.  FAA STORE - DAY

	ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.

				BEN
		Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her
		and some other guy I can't see.

				FALE
		Hey, no problem, it's probably just
		another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's
		shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.
			(indicating Jeffrey to the others)
		This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic
		who told his former psychiatrist all his
		plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible
		schemes, and now who knows what she's
		painted out there on our wall?

				JEFFREY
		WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON
		WALLS?
			(moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger)
		You think I told her about the Army of
		the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why,
		you pathetically ineffectual and
		pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to-
		animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because
		when I had anything to do with her six
		years ago, there was no such thing -- I
		hadn't even thought of it yet!

				FALE
			(triumphant)
		Then how come she knows what's going on?

	JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a
	supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.

				JEFFREY
		Here's my theory on that.  While I was
		institutionalized, my brain was studied
		exhaustively in the guise of mental health.
		I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied
		thoroughly.  Then, everything about me
		was entered into a computer where they
		created a model of my mind.

	They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY.  Is he
	serious?  Is he crazy?  Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.

				JEFFREY (cont.)
		Then, using the computer model, they
		generated every thought I could possibly
		have in the next, say ten years, which
		they then filtered through a probability
		matrix to determine everything I was
		going to do in that period.  So you
		see, she knew I was going to lead the
		Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the
		pages of history before it ever even
		occurred to me.  She knows everything
		I'm ever going to do before I know it
		myself.  How about that?

	JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.

				JEFFREY
		Now I have to get going -- do my part.
		You guys check all this stuff out and
		load up the van.  Make sure you have
		everything.  I'm outta here.

	JEFFREY exits.  The others stare at the door.

				FALE
		He's seriously crazy -- you know that.

	EXT.  SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY

	An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.

	The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES
	COP'S eyes searching everywhere.

	Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the
	torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.

	HER POV:  the POLICE CAR passes from view.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,

				RAILLY
		James!  Come on.

	A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster,
	bits of lettuce in his hair.

				COLE
		I don't understand what we're doing.
	
				RAILLY
			(climbing out of the dumpster)
		We're avoiding the police until I
		can....talk to you.

				COLE
			(climbing out after her)
		You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn,
		those words on the wall -- I've seen
		them before...  I...I...dreamed them.

	But she's not listening.  She's peeking out the alley entrance.

	RAILLY'S POV:  across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,
	THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

	The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often,
	stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.

				DESK CLERK
		Twenty five bucks an hour.

				RAILLY
		An hour?!

				DESK CLERK
		You want quarter hours, go someplace else.

				RAILLY
			(catches on, pulls out her last bills)
		Here's ninety eight.  For the night.  Deal?

	The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events.  Then, he
	turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.

				DESK CLERK
		Forty four.  Fourth floor, turn right.
		Elevator's busted.

	RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs
	passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas
	chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.

	ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb
	stairs.  As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone,
	punches a number, speaks into the phone.

				DESK CLERK
		Tommy?  This is Charlie at the Globe.
		You know if Wallace has a new girl?
		Sort of a rookie type?  Blonde?

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

	COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY
	pace back and forth like a mad woman.

				RAILLY
		Okay...you were standing there looking
		at the moon...you were eating grass...
		then what?

				COLE
		I thought I was in...prison again.

				RAILLY
		Just like that?  You were in prison?

				COLE
		No, not really.  It's...it's in my
		mind.  Like you said.

				RAILLY
		You disappeared!  One minute you were
		there, the next minute you were gone.
		Did you run through the woods?

				COLE
		I don't know -- I don't remember.

				RAILLY
		The boy in the well.  How did you know
		that was just a hoax?

				COLE
		It was?  I didn't...know.

				RAILLY
		James, you said he was hiding in the barn...

				COLE
		I think I saw a TV show like that when
		I was a kid.  Where a boy...

				RAILLY
		IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!

	COLE looks at her.  She's really upset.

				COLE
		Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV
		show and copied it.  Listen, you were
		right, it's all in my head.  I'm mentally
		ill, I imagine all that stuff.  I know
		they're not real, I can trick them, make
		them do what I want.  I just worked on
		them in my head and I got back here.  I
		can get better.  I can stay here.

	RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.

	It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in
	WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,

				RAILLY
		What does this mean to you?

				COLE
		...I had a dream about...something
		like that.

				RAILLY
		You had a bullet from World War One in
		your leg, James!  How did it get there?

				COLE
		You said I had delusions -- that I
		created a world -- you said you could
		explain everything...

				RAILLY
		Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying
		to.  I can't believe that everything we
		do or say has already happened, that we
		can't change what's going to happen,
		that I'm one of the three billion
		people who are going to die...soon.

	COLE stands, moves close to her.

				COLE
		I want to be here.  In this time.  With
		you.  I want to become...become a whole
		person.  I want this to be the present.
		I want the future to be unknown.

				RAILLY
			(sudden hopeful idea!)
		James...do you remember...six years
		ago...you had a phone number!  You
		tried to call and...

	WHAM!  The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not
	holding.  A menacing figure stands in the doorway.  WALLACE.  A
	wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.

	COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks
	them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.

				WALLACE
		This is my territory, bitch!

				COLE
			(confused, turns to Railly)
		Is this real -- or is this one of my
		delusions?

				RAILLY
		This is definitely real:
			(to Wallace)
		Excuse me, I think we have a little
		misunderstanding here...

	WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face.  She flies back against the
	wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is
	stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife

				WALLACE
		What're you -- some kind of tough guy?
		You wanna be a hero?  You gonna try and
		mess with me?  Come on...

	A beat.  COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around
	WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.

				WALLACE
		Now that's a smart boy.  But you,
		honey, you think you can go 'round
		me and peddle your fancy ass in this
		part of town, you bet your life we got
		what I would call a major goddamn
		misunderstandin'.

	RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs
	her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face
	with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a
	twig!  The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain
	and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves
	the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.

				RAILLY
		JAMES -- DON'T!

	COLE hesitates.

				WALLACE
			(eyes bulging)
		You...heard...her.  Don't do it, man.

				RAILLY
			(gets up, looks around)
		Put him in the closet, ... But get his
		money first.

				COLE
			(amazed)
		You want me to rob him?

				RAILLY
		I...I...We need cash, James.

	A shadow.  RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE
	disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...

				SHOUTS (o.s.)
		They're killing him!  Call the cops.

	Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his
	pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.

				WALLACE
		You two are crazy.  I got friends.  You
		put me in a closet, they're gonna be
		really pissed.

	COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to
his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.

	HER POV:  A fire escape leads down into an alley.

	RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the
	bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.

				RAILLY
		James, no!

	INT.  BATHROOM

				RAILLY'S VOICE (from the other room)
			(rattling the door knob)
		James, what are you doing?

	WALLACE cowers back against the shower stall.

				WALLACE
		I have friends, man -- if you cut me...

	WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don't see!

				WALLACE
		What...the...fuck..are you doing???

	INT.  GLOBE MOTEL ROOM 44

	RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it
	opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping
	with blood.

				RAILLY
		Oh, my God, James.  Did you kill him?

	COLE shakes his head "no" as blood oozes from his mouth.

				COLE
		Just...just in case.  In case I'm not
		crazy...
			(holds up two bloody molars)
		That's how they find us.  By our teeth.
			(a beat, eye contact)
		I don't want them to find me.  Ever.  I
		don't want to go back.

	RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the
	choice he's made.  Given up the future (if it exists, and it's
	looking like it does)!  Risking his life to be with her!  For
	this brief time!  She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears
	welling in her eyes.  But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and
	feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.

	INT.  STAIRWELL/GLOBE HOTEL

	COPS' boots THUNDER up the stairwell.

	INT.  ROOM 44/GLOBE HOTEL

	In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as
	COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.

				RAILLY
		Push it tight!

				WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
		NO PROBLEM!  I'LL JUST STAY IN HERE!
		DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

	INT.  4TH FLOOR HALLWAY/GLOBE HOTEL

	POLICE OFFICERS, led by the PLAINCLOTHES COP, make a cautious
	entrance onto the 4th floor, guns drawn.

	Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into
	their doorways.

	EXT.  GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY

	COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.
	They come to the end of the metal stairway.  It's a long distance
	to the ground.  COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.

	She lets herself down to him.  Their eyes meet.  He holds her in
	his arms for a moment.  Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.
	They start running down the alley.

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY

	The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall
	alongside the open doorway to Room 44.  The UNIFORMED OFFICERS
	are backing him up, weapons drawn.

				PLAINCLOTHES COP
		POLICE!  THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND
		COME OUTTA THERE!

	No response.

	INT.  GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44

	The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol
	extended in both hands.  He pans the gun around the empty room.

	HIS POV:  the open window...the blood on the floor.

				WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
		HEY!  ZAT THE POLICE!  I'M AN INNOCENT
		VICTIM IN HERE!  I WAS ATTACKED BY A
		COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!

	EXT.  BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON

	A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the
	toney downtown shopping district.  Among them, RAILLY looks
	furtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  She's hidden her
	bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody
	handkerchief to his mouth.

	As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling
	city, the tall downtown buildings.  His eyes go up.

	COLE'S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  A building
	with a ledge.  The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!

	ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed
	entrance to a store.

				RAILLY
		Wait here.  I'm going to try that phone
		number.  Let's hope it's nothing!

	Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches
	her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made
	intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES
	looming frighteningly close.

	A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display
	window.  Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away

	Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size
	toy in the display window.  Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.

	COLE'S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into
	the phone.

	ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a
	panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  Confused, COLE stares
	at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating
	BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,
	eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.

				RAILLY
		James!  James!  It's okay.  We're
		insane!  We're crazy!

	COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.

				RAILLY
		It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...

				COLE
		A Carpet Cleaning Company?

				RAILLY
			(laughing)
		No superiors!  No scientists.  No
		people from the future.  It's just a
		Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have
		voice mail -- you leave a message
		telling them when you want your carpet
		cleaned.

				COLE
		You... you left them a message?
	
				RAILLY
			(impishly)
		I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved.
		Wait'll they hear this nutty woman
		telling them...they better watch out
		for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...

	Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he
	realizes the truth!  He starts to recite...

				COLE
		"The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --
		they're the ones who are going to do
		it.  I can't do anything more.  The
		police are watching me."

	Now she's stunned.  She glances back and sees the phone booth
	twenty yards away.

				RAILLY
		You... you couldn't have heard me.

				COLE
		They got your message, Kathryn.  They
		played it for me.  It was a bad
		recording...distorted.  I didn't
		recognize your voice.

	RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.

	ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE
	CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.
	Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him
	into the CROWD.

				RAILLY
		Come on.

	INT.  DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM

	RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds
	a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped
	on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.

				RAILLY
		And this.
			(turning)
		Anything else?

	But COLE'S not here.  He's a short distance away...staring.

	COLE'S POV:  aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of
	brand new consumer goods.

	ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and
	full of moldering merchandise.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.

				RAILLY
		I guess that's it.

				CLERK
		Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?

				RAILLY
			(producing Wallace's roll of bills)
		No -- I'll pay cash.

	The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!

				RAILLY
		What floor are the wigs on, please?

	EXT.  PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT

	Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a
	PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered
	street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.

	INT.  PARKED PEST CONTROL VAN

	The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among
	them, all wearing black.  Some of them have climbing gear, tool
	belts, all sorts of paraphernalia.  KWESKIN is telling his story.

				KWESKIN
		So then he goes into this incredible riff
		about how his shrink, like, replicated
		his brain while he was in the nut house.
		Turned it into a computer.

				WELLER
		And Fale believed it?

				KWESKIN
		Oh, you know Fale!  He's like, "If you
		guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will --
		I never saw you before in nay life!"

	LAUGHTER from all of them.  Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic
	series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.

	POPE quickly slides the door open.  It's JEFFREY...grinning.

	Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of
	the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.

	The van occupants react with murmurs of "Awwwwwright" and "Far
	out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.

	Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.

				JEFFREY
		Let's do it!

	EXT.  VAN/FREEWAY

	The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.

	INT.  PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING

	The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a
	flashlight and goes over "the plan" with the other ACTIVISTS.

				JEFFREY
		Okay, that's Stage One.  In Stage Two,
		Monkey Four is over here...

	A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.

				GOINES
		What's the harm in opening the bag?
		His eyes are taped.

				SANDY
		Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.

				JEFFREY
		Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.

				ICHIOKA
		So why should we be like him?

	Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing
	DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.

				JEFFREY
		Want the full effect?

	Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.

				DR. MASON
		Jeffrey?  I know it's you, Jeffrey.  I
		recognize your voice.

	JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.

				DR. MASON
		JEFFREY???  ... Very well.  You're out
		of your mind, Jeffrey.  I know all
		about your insane plan.  That woman --
		your psychiatrist -- she told me.

	JEFFREY raises his eyebrows.  This he hadn't expected.

				DR. MASON
		I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy
		even for you.  But, just in case, I took steps
		to make sure you couldn't do it.  I took myself
		out of the loop!  I don't have the code any
		more.  I don't have access to the virus.  So,
		go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract
		anything of use to yourself.

	The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.

				JEFFREY
		What...virus?

				DR. MASON
			(spins his head toward Jeffrey)
		She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew
		you were going to try this.

				JEFFREY
		What virus are we talking about, Dad?

				DR. MASON
		You're insane, Jeffrey.

				JEFFREY
		You "develop" viruses and you're calling
		me insane?  Typical.  What does this
		virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick
		fuck, it doesn't matter.
			(to the others)
		Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I
		put helpless animals in cages and measure
		their reactions to electrical stimuli?
		Do I inject radioactive substances into
		living creatures and examine their
		bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!

				DR. MASON
		Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly
		are you going to do?  I don't have to
		tell you I'm afraid.

				JEFFREY
		THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE
		OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY.
		GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS
		HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED
		FUCKING MANIAC?

	INT.  MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT

	Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward.
	It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods.  SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE
	(KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a
	redwood tree.  We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO.

				SCOTTY (up on the screen)
		Here's a cross section of one of the
		old trees that's been cut down.

	They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,
	"BIRTH OF CHRIST", "DISCOVERY OF AMERICA", "MAGNA CARTA SIGNED",
	"1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS", and "1930 TREE CUT DOWN".

	ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the
	flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.

	ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.

				MADELINE (up on the screen)
		Somewhere in here I was born.  And here
		-- I die.  There's only a moment for
		you.  You don't notice.

	ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the
	theater.  WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES

				RAILLY
		Here, let me help you.

	The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the
	screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's
	doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.

				COLE
		I think I've seen this movie before.
		When I was a kid.  It was on TV.

				RAILLY
			(fussing with his upper lip)
		Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.

				COLE
			(moving his head to see the film)
		I have seen it, but I don't remember
		this part.  Funny, it's like what's
		happening to us, like the past.  The
		movie never changes -- it can't change
		-- but everytime you see it, it seems
		to be different because you're different
		-- you notice different things.

				RAILLY
		If we can't change anything...because
		it's already happened, then we ought to
		at least smell the flowers.

				COLE
		Flowers!  What flowers?

	From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.

				RAILLY
			(whispering)
		It's an expression.  Here...

	She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing
	it on COLE'S head, adjusting it...

				COLE
		Why are we doing this?

				RAILLY
		So we can stick our heads out the
		window and feel the wind and listen to
		the music.  So we can appreciate what
		we have while we have it.  Forgive me,
		psychiatrists don't cry.

	There are tears in her eyes.  They discomfit COLE.

				COLE
		But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're
		wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.

				RAILLY
		In a few weeks, it will have started or
		it won't.  If there are still baseball
		games and traffic jams, armed robberies
		and boring TV shows -- we'll be so
		happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves
		in to the police.

				SHADOWY MOVIEGOER
		SHHHHHHH    

				COLE
			(whispers)
		Where can we hide for a few weeks?

	ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground,
	the OCEAN behind them.

				RAILLY
		You said you'd never seen the ocean...

	EXT.  GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.

	URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS.  Then, METAL ON METAL.
	Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen
	with phony rocks.  Stalking back and forth.  Huge.  Upset.

	CLANK.  CLANK.  METAL ON METAL.  GRUNTS of effort, then, DR.
	MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.

				DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.)
		What are you doing to me?  Where are
		we?  Jeffrey, please...

				SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		For God's sake, put the tape back on
		his mouth!

	The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.

				JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Forget the tape.  The monkey's louder than
		he is.  You gonna tape the monkey's mouth?

	EXT.  PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT

	Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and
	forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.

	EXT.  LION'S PEN/ZOO

	The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR.  From the darkness,
	unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.

	EXT.  AVIARIES/ZOO

	A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of
	metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous
	CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other
	EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.

	INT.  MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM

	CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS
	continue.  Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie
	filling his field of vision.

	HIS POV:  the MOVIE SCREEN.  TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by
	screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS.

	ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around.  Empty seats on
	both sides of him.  He's alone.  He panics.

				COLE
		Kathryn?!

	INT.  THEATER LOBBY

	A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock
	Festival".  PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead
	to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a
	tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone.  Turning, she
	reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses.
	She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM!  Crossing the lobby toward
	the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate
	in the tight dress.

	Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a
	Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this
	man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip.  The BLONDE MAN
	stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.

				BRUNETTE
		We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.

	The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional,
	revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe.  The Blonde Man is
	COLE!  He's confused.

				COLE
		You were in my dream just now.  I
		didn't recognize you.

				RAILLY
		Well, you look pretty different, too.

				COLE
		I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize
		it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I
		thought you were gone.

				RAILLY
			(studies him seriously)
		I remember you...like this.  I feel
		I've known you before.  I feel I've
		always known you.

	Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him
	with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked,
	unmarked door, then closing it behind them.

	INT.  STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER

	RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room.  She
	kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other
	janitorial items.  COLE responds to her passion as they move
	deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters.
	Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled
	theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.

	EXT.  SUBURBS - DAWN

	The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the
	silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.
	The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads
	across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than
	reality.  Did we really see him at all?

	EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN

	The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished
	building, deserted in the early morning light.  High up, a MONKEY
	his head around a girder.

	Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.

	EXT.  SHOPPING MALL - DAWN

	Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other
	across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.

	Nothing happens.  For a long moment.  Then, an AFRICAN BULL
	ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along
	the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the
	other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.

	INT.  TAXICAB/CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING

	A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is
	at the wheel of the cab.

				WOMAN CABBlE
		What time's your flight, friends?

	In the back seat, COLE, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to
	his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make-up, RAILLY.

				RAILLY
		Nine thirty

				WOMAN CABBIE
		Might be tight.

				RAILLY
			(startled, checks her watch)
		Tight?  My watch says 7:30.

				WOMAN CABBIE
		On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a
		time, but today, gotta take inta account
		your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.

				RAILLY
		What?  What did you say?

				WOMAN CABBIE
		Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks
		didn't turn on your radio this morning.

	COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.

				WOMAN CABBIE
		Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta
		the zoo last night.  Then they locked up
		this big shot scientist in one of the cages.
		Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!

	RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.

				WOMAN CABBlE
		Now they got animals all over the
		place.  Buncha zebras shut down the
		thruway 'bout an hour ago and some
		kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got
		traffic blocked for miles over on 22.

	Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.

				RAILLY
		That's what they were up to!  Freeing
		animals!

				COLE
		On the walls -- they meant the animals
		when they said, "We did it."

				WOMAN CABBIE
		You can hear it on the radio all the
		stations...

	As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE
	follows her look.

	COLE'S POV:  two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the
	cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!

				ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
		In the meantime, numerous animal rights
		activists have joined the chorus
		condemning what they're calling the
		"loose canon" activities of Jeffrey
		Mason and his Army of the Twelve
		Monkeys.
				RIGHTS ACTIVIST/RADIO (o.s.)
		Can these fools seriously believe that
		releasing a captive animal into an
		urban environment is being compassionate
		to the animal?  It's mindlessly cruel,
		almost as indefensible as holding the
		animal in captivity in the first place.

	RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a
	backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.

				RAILLY
		Maybe it's going to be okay.

	INT.  TICKET COUNTER/AIRPORT TERMINAL - MORNING

	CLOSY ON copies of the mug shot of COLE and a photo of RAILLY
	while the airport P.A. SYSTEM DRONES in the b.g..

	REVEAL a DETECTIVE, giving the flyers to the uniformed SUPERVISOR
	at one end of the ticket counter.

				DETECTIVE
		Tell your people if they spot either
		one of them, not to try and apprehend
		then.  They should notify us and...

	ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.

				P.A. SYSTEM
		-- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready
		for boarding at Gate Seventeen.

	ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the
	bustling airport lobby.

				COLE
		I know this place! ... This is my dream.

				RAILLY
		Airports all look the same.  Maybe
		it's...
			(turning, reacting)
		James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.

	But COLE isn't listening.  He's looking around, mesmerized.

				COLE
		It's not just my dream.  I was actually
		here!  I remember now.  My parents
		brought me to meet my uncle.  About a
		week or two before...before...before
		everybody started dying.

	RAILLY glances around nervously.

	RAILLY'S POV:  two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the
	lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.

				RAILLY
		They may be looking for us, James.
			(placing the tube in his hand)
		Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
  
				COLE
			(confounded)
		I was here...as a kid.  I think you
		were here, too.  But you...looked just
		like you look now.

				RAILLY
			(getting desperate)
		James, if we're identified, they're
		going to send us someplace...but not to
		Key West!

				COLE
			(snaps out of it, hand to moustache)
		Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.

				RAILLY
			(indicating a sign)
		I'll get the tickets and meet you... in
		the Gift Shop.

	COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men's Room as
	RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip
	clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring
	glances.

	INT.  TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY

	BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as
	COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room.

	Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it.  Coming
	to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.

	INT.  TZCKET COUNTER/TERMINAL

	CLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter,
	hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT
	who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN.  The GENTLEMAN
	walks away.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, stepping up to the counter, smiling, looking
	nothing like the Railly on the flyer.

				RAILLY
		Judy Simmons.  I have reservations for
		Key West.

	INT.  PAY PHONES/TERMINAL

	COLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense.

				COLE
		Listen, I don't know whether you're
		there or not.  Maybe you just clean
		carpets.  If you do, you're lucky --
		you're gonna live a long, happy life.
		But if you other guys exist and you're
		picking this up -- forget about the
		Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they
		didn't do it.  It was a mistake'
		Someone else did it.  The Army of The
		Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids
		playing revolutionaries.  It was
		someone else!

	COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next
	phone looking away quickly.  COLE touches his loose moustache as
	he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.

				COLE
		I've done my job.  I did what you wanted.
		Good luck.  I'm not coming back!

	COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares.
	Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room.

	INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY

	The TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills.

				TICKET AGENT
		Don't see a lot of this... cash.

				RAILLY
		It's...a long story.

				TICKET AGENT
			(smiles, hands over the tickets)
		They'll begin boarding in about twenty
		minutes.  Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.

	Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put
	them in her purse and they flutter to the floor.  As she kneels
	to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from
	the waist down.  WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag
	resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants.
	we've seen this outfit before...in COLE'S dream...on MR. PONYTAIL!

	INT.  MEN'S ROOM/AIRPORT - DAY

	The P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing
	and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying
	his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves.

	Quickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men's
	Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some
	goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly
	against his face as he leans close to the mirror.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Got yourself a prob, Bob?

	COLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE.  Nothing!  Until
	he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an
	occupied stall.  It must be him!

				COLE
		Leave me alone!  I made a report.  I
		didn't have to do that.

				RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
		Point of fact -- you don't belong here.
		It's not permitted to let you stay.

	A toilet FLUSHES in the "occupied" stall.  COLE'S answer is loud
	and defiant.

				COLE
		This is the present.  This is not the past.
		This is not the future.  This is right now!

	A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the "occupied" stall, gives COLE
	a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.

				COLE
		I'm staying here! You got that?  You
		can't stop me!

				PLUMP MAN
			(high pitched voice)
		Anything you say, chief.  It's none of
		my business.

	COLE looks dismayed.  This guy couldn't be "THE VOICE"!  And there
	are no feet showing under the other stalls.  Did he imagine it?

	INT.  TICKET COUNTER - DAY

	The Chicago Bulls bag!  It's on the counter in front of the
	TICKET AGENT who's reviewing a stack of tickets in awe...

				TICKET AGENT
		Woooo-eeee.  San Francisco, New
		Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome,
		Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking!
		That's some trip you're taking, sir,
		All in one week!

				MR. PONYTAIL (o.s.)
		Business.

				TICKET AGENT
			(handing over the tickets)
		Have a good one, sir.

	INT.  TERMINAL LOBBY

	COLE emerges from the Men's Room, shaken, paranoid.  He glances
	around nervously.  Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking
	toward the Gift Shop.  Before he gets more than a few steps,
	someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind.

				FAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.)
		You gotta be crazy, man!

	COLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A.
	Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses

				COLE
		Jo...Jose????

				JOSE
		Pulling out the tooth, man, that was
		nuts!  Here, take this.

	JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol.  Astonished, COLE resists!

				COLE
		What?  What for?  Are you crazy?

	Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm.

				JOSE
		Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one!
		You were a hero, man.  They gave you a
		pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come
		back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!

				COLE
		How did you find me?

				JOSE
		The phone call, man.  The phone call.

				COLE
		The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?

				JOSE
		Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago!
		Yes, that phone call.  I been in training
		for this a couple a months now -- ever
		since I got back from that... "weird"
		war we were in.  You remember that?
			(pressing the pistol on Cole)
		Here, take it, man!  You could still be
		a hero if you'd cooperate!

	INT.  GIFT SHOP/TERMINAL - DAY

	RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it,
	includes it with several magazines she's holding.  She doesn't
	notice MR. PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!

	The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and
	frowns.  It's getting late and where's Cole?  She turns, heads
	for the cash register to make her purchases.

	MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already.
	He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.

	The paper features a banner headline..."ANIMALS SET FREE" and a
	sub head..."PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE"
	over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and
	another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.

	Stepping in line behind MR. PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch
	again. Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY
	looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us.

	Startled, RAILLY frowns.  Does she know this man?

	MR. PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the
	shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.

	RAILLY doesn't recognize the man, but we do!  He's DR. MASON'S
	ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...the man who attended RAILLY's lecture!

	Smiling, DR. PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.

	Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the
	CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops
	a bundle of newspapers at her feet.

	RAILLY'S POV:  the front page shows a photo of three frightened
	GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, "TERRORISTS
	CREATE CHAOS".  Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the
	gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.

	CLOSE ON THE SHOT OF DR. MASON in his lab.  There's someone else
	in the picture.  It's a man wearing a lab coat and a PONYTAIL!

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, suddenly remembering!

	MEMORY FLASHBACK!  INT.  RECEPTION ROOM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT

	RAILLY looks up from the book she's signing and sees DR. PETERS.

				DR. PETERS
		Isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little"
		represents the sane vision and that
		Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!"
		is the cry of the true lunatic?

	INT.  GIFT SHOP - DAY

	RAILLY, stunned, stares in the direction PETERS/PONYTAIL went.

				RAILLY
		Oh, my God!

				P.A  SYSTEM
		-- flight 764 for San Francisco is now
		ready for boarding at Gate 36.

	INT.  LOBBY - DAY

	In the confusion of TRAVELERS streaming in different directions,
	COLE hurries toward the Gift Shop while JOSE struggles to keep up.

				JOSE
		Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole.
			(then, blurting it out)
		Look, I got orders, man!  You know what
		I'm sposed to do if you don't go along?
		I'm sposed to shoot the lady!  You got
		that?  They said, "If Cole don't obey
		this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his
		girlfriend!"

	COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.

				JOSE
		I got no choice, man.  These are my
		orders.  Just take it, okay?

	COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now.  They've got him.

				COLE
		This part isn't about the virus, is it?

				JOSE
		Hey, man...

				COLE
		It's about obeying, about doing what
		you're told.

				JOSE
		They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya
		want?

				COLE
		Who am I supposed to shoot?

	Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.

				RAILLY
		James!  Thank God!  I thought you'd
		disappeared.  Listen, I think I know
		who it is!  I saw him!  It's Dr. Mason's
		assistant.  An apocalypse nut!  The next
		flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38.
		If he's there, it has to be him.

	JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY
	grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.

				COLE
		I love you, Kathryn.  Remember that.

	She doesn't hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.

				RAILLY
		Maybe we can stop him.  Maybe we can
		actually do something.

	INT.  SECURITY CHECK POINT/TERMINAL - DAY

	A young boy of nine passes through the magnetic arch grinning.
	YOUNG COLE!  Exactly as he appears in the dream!

	He joins his PARENTS, who are only visible from their chests
	down, and they continue along the concourse.  WE LINGER and
	DISCOVER two DETECTIVES watching TRAVELERS as they pass through
	the magnetic arch and retrieve their bags from the X-ray machine,
	comparing their faces to photos of COLE and RAILLY.

	ANGLE ON A SECURITY OFFICER, watching the x-ray monitor.

	ANGLE ON THE MONITOR, showing the X-RAY IMAGE of a sports bag moving
	along the conveyer belt.  The bag contains some strange objects.

	ANGLE ON THE SECURITY OFFICER, reacting.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		Excuse me, sir.  Would you mind letting me
		have a look at the contents of your bag?

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, coming through the magnetic arch, reacting.

				DR. PETERS
		Me?  Oh, yes, of course.  My samples.
		I have the appropriate papers.

	INT.  END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT

	RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of
	TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security.

				RAILLY
		Oh, God, we don't have time for this.

	ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his
	Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of
	clothes and a Walkman.

				DR. PETERS
		Biological samples.  I have the
		paperwork right here.

	DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY
	OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		I'm going to have to ask you to open
		this, sir.

				DR. PETERS
		Open it?
			(blinks stupidly, then)
		Of course.

	DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it.

	There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them.  DR. PETERS pays no
	attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE.

	SECURITY OFFICER'S POV:  RAILLY, trying to explain something to a
	SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.

	ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the
	commotion.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed
	glass tube out of the metal cylinder.

				DR. PETERS
		Here!  You see?  Biological!  Check the
		papers -- it's all proper.  I have a
		permit.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		It's empty!

	Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.

				DR. PETERS
		Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!
		But I assure you, it's not.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND
	SECURITY OFFICER.

				RAILLY
		Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!

				SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
		You'll have to get in line, ma'am.

				TRAVELER
		We're all in a hurry, lady.  What's so
		special about you?

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other
	metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers.

				DR. PETERS
		You see!  Also invisible to the naked eye.

	A beat.  OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes,
	and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose!

				DR. PETERS
		It doesn't even have an odor.

	The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing,
	and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.

				SECURITY OFFICER
		That's not necessary, sir.  Here you
		go.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Have
		a good flight.

	Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and
	shoves them back into his gym bag.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her
	with his finger.

				SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
		Who are you calling a "moron"?

				COLE
		Get your hands off her!

	The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble.

	ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get
	involved.  Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns.

	FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV:  COLE'S moustache is slipping.  COLE
	senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look.
	For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away.

				SECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.}
		HOLD IT!  JUST A MOMENT.

	DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen.

	The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from
	the floor beside the search table.  He waves them at DR. PETERS.

	DR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants.

	ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he
	confronts the SECURITY OFFICER.

				COLE
		I said, get your hands off her.  She's
		not a criminal.  She's a doctor...a
		psychiatrist.

	RAILLY looks alarmed at that.

	ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way.  The FIRST DETECTIVE
	has the photos in his hand.

	ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting
	hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates.

	ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS!

				RAILLY
		THERE HE IS!  HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY
		VIRUS!  STOP HIM!

	ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE
	MAN FROM HIS DREAM!

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.

				RAILLY (o.s.)
		PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM!

	ANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE.

				FIRST DETECTIVE
			(raising his badge)
		Police Officers.  Would you step over
		here, please.

	ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES!

	COLE'S POV:  SCARFACE, dressed like a "businessman"!  He gives
	COLE a cold look.

	A beat.  COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off
	balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it.

	The ALARM goes off!!!!

	The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks
	him aside like a rag doll.

	ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back.

	ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol.

	ANGLE ON THE SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.

				FIRST SECURITY OFFICER
		HE'S GOT A GUN!

	ANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE.

				FIRST DETECTIVE
			STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!
	
	ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward
	DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a
	plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see.

	IT'S SUDDENLY AS IF THE DREAM IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE!!!  THE
	SAME MOKENTS INTERSPERSED WITH "NEW" MOMENTS FROM THE POV OF
	YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR. PETERS
	hurries by.  DR. PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by
	pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling...

				DR. PETERS
		WATCH IT!

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching...

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his
	moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear
	shot in the crowded passageway.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings,
	high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS...

				BRUNETTE (RAILLY)
		N0OOOOO0O!!!!!!

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing!  CRACK!

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him.

				MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		My God!  They shot that man!

	Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE
	MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up
	and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears.
	(WE'VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE IN COLE'S DREAM, A POWERFUL MOMENT,
	UNFOLDING UNNATURALLY SLOWLY, OPENING LIKE A FLOWER.)

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see
	emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the
	BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Come along, son, this is no place for us.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER'S ARM drapes over his shoulder,
	steering him.  YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he's led away.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging
	helplessly.  It's too late.  The BLONDE MAN is dead.

	YOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears,
	suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for
	something.  POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her.
	Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS
	(whose faces remain out of view).  He can't help sneaking another
	look back.

	YOUNG COLE'S POV:  POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting
	RAILLY.  Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically.

	Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...she's
	found what she's looking for!

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look.

	ANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded
	concourse.

	ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look.

				FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Hurry up, son.

	With a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG
	COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes.  WE MOVE IN...CLOSE...
	CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes.  WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS,
	BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL.  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING,
	BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HE WILL REMEMBER!

				MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy.

	INT.  747 CABIN - DAY

	DR. PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack
	containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat.  Next to
	him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says...

				FELLOW TRAVELER'S VOICE (o.s.)
		It's obscene, all the violence, all the
		lunacy.  Shootings even at airports now.
		You might say...we're the next endangered
		species...human beings!

	CLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor.

				DR. PETERS
		I think you're right. sir.  I think
		you've hit the nail on the head.

	DR. PETERS' POV:  the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman
	in a business suit, offering his hand congenially.  DR. PETERS
	doesn't know who this man is, but we do.  It's the ASTROPHYSICIST!

				ASTROPHYSICIST
		Jones is my name.  I'm in insurance.

	EXT.   PARKING LOT/AIRPORT

	As YOUNG COLE'S PARENTS (seen only as sleeves and torsos) usher
	YOUNG COLE into their station wagon, the boy hesitates, looks
	back, watches a 747 climb into the sky.

TITLE					    PART I
					    AFRICA
					    3,000,000 YEARS AGO

A1
VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT

The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,
and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-
rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not
yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.

										 a1

A2
INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER

The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and
they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.
About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.

The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.
As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know
the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond
his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-
iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then
he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the
hyenas.

Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly
five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over
a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,
and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is
low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As
he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already

										 a2

A2
CONTINUED

something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those
dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-
tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years.

										 a3

A3
EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS

As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream.

The Others are already there. They were there on the other
side every day - that did not make it any less annoying.

There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As
they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply
In kind.

The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has
staked its claim to its own territory.

										 a4

A4
EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES

Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit
and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around
them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet
all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.

										 a5

A5
EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION

The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-
side foraging for roots and occasional berries.

Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,
about fifty feet apart.

The ground is flat for miles around.

Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking
them about 300 yards away.

Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all
directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.

										 a6

A6
EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY

It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no
real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day
with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a
hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he
also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices
them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever
likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually
weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could
hope for.

										 a7

A7
INT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS

Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -
but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;
it was merely part of the background of life.

This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,
was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.
If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave.

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,
and though he could not remember it, when he was young,
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.
Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high
enough.

He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the

										 a8

A7
CONTINUED

occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down
there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.

And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come.

										 a9

A8
EXT  THE STREAM - INVASION

The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When
they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins.

In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,
shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led
by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.

Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first
advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a
mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own
territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.
He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his
experience.

Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing

										 a10

A8
CONTINUED

down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they
move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy
they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original
drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.

As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately
revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill
his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership.

Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away.

The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other.

Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,
and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,

										 a11

A8
CONTINUED

he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,
and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is
so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening
In Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.

Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.

With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the
stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
The water's edge.

										 a12

EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND

Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound.

He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his
senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.
Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of
his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The
great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional
cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous
beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at
concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.

And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet.

										 a13

A10
EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK

Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he
leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.
He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing
had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There
is nothing in the least alarming about it.

It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of
some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.
There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious
of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.
As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,
hard surface.

After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a
brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it
must have grown during the night. There are many plants
that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that
they are small and round, whereas this is large and square;

										 a14

A10
CONTINUED

but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few
that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?

A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.
There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.

										 a15

A11
EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON

They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the
sound begins.

It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube
and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first
time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of
drumming is heard in Africa.

The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards
the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little
dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet.

Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting
the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,
and the hunger in their bellies.

Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,

										 a16

A11
CONTINUED

rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-
eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.

Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four
hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's
own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog
lies near them.

This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From
time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.
The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally
different scene.

The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;
it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.

										 a17

A11
CONTINUED

A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species.

But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male
suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon
its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.
And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one
amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.

Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement
can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene
freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless
above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.

The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if

										 a18

A11
CONTINUED

awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle
back to their caves.

They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that
night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher
feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge
to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.

A12
EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia

Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-
year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others
threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.
In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition.

They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no
longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons
well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the Cube had revealed to them.

They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they
had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.
Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did
not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave.

But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The
first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for

										 a20

A12
CONTINUED

somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to
die of starvation.

										 a21

A13
EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION

With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,
betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.

When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,
they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound
of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave
against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their
strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.

The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these
creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life; he goes back to his meal.

The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with
amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.

Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

										 a22

A13
CONTINUED

onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-
confidence and bad luck.

The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory.

					  * * * * * * * *

And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done.

										 a23

A14
EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD

From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of
their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-
looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.

The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today
something is different, though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact.

Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and
begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen.

As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence.

At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They
carry their bone clubs and bone knives.

										 a24

A14
CONTINUED

Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-
chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their
hearts.

Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,
displaying its frightful fangs.

The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.

Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.
Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled
standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed
by his band.

The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even
the ability to flee.

Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands

										 a25

A14
CONTINUED

unsurely in front of his band.

Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club
until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him.

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.

Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the
world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would
think of something.

					    FLOYD
					    I'm sorry, but I'm not sure

					    SMYSLOV
					    Well, it's just for the past

					    some extremely odd things
					    happening at Clavius.

					    FLOYD
					    Really?

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes. Well, for one thing,
					    whenever you phone the base,
					    all you can get is a recording

					    FLOYD
					    You mean you haven't been able

					    days?

					    SMYSLOV
					    That's right.

					    FLOYD
					    I see.

					    FLOYD
					    Well, that does sound very odd.

					    SMYSLOV
					    Yes, and I'm afaid there's
					    going to be a bit of a row about

					    NARRATOR
					    The Aries-IB has become the

					    by low-thrust plasma jets which
					    would continue the mild acceler-

					    Oh, marvellous. It's the first

					    There's nothing like weightless

					    We're scheduled to dock in about

					    if I can have a word with you about
					    the security arrangements?

					    FLOYD
					    What do you mean?

					    PILOT
					    Well... the crew is confined to
					    the ship when we land at Clavius.
					    We have to stay inside for the
					    time it take to refit - about
					    twenty-four hours. And then
					    we're going to back empty.

					    FLOYD
					    I see.

					    I'm afraid that's out of my depart-

					    the Auditing Department of the
					    Territorial Administrator and I
					    haven't been able to get her on
					    the phone for the past week or so,
					    and with all these stories one
					    hears, I'm a little concerned
					    about her.

					    FLOYD
					    I see. Well, I'm sorry about that.
					    I wouldn't think there's any cause
					    for alarm.

					    PILOT
					    Yes, well, I wouldn't have been
					    too concerned about it, except
					    I've heard these stories about the
					    epidemic and, as a matter of fact,
					    I've heard that ten people have

					    of the National Council of
					    Astronautics. He has just
					    completed a special flight here
					    from Earth to be with us, and

					    Floyd.

POLITE APPLAUSE. FLOYD
WALKS TO FRONT OF ROOM.

					    FLOYD
					    First of all, I bring a personal
					    message from Dr. Howell, who
					    has asked me to convey his
					    deepest appreciation to all of
					    you for the personal sacrifices
					    you have made, and of course
					    his congratulations on your
					    discovery which may well prove
					    to be among the most significant
					    in the history of science.

POLITE APPLAUSE.

11/25/65										 b54 

B38
CONTINUED

					    FLOYD (cont'd)
					    Mr. Halvorsen has made known
					    to me some of the conflicting
					    views held by many of you
					    regarding the need for complete
					    security in this matter, and
					    more specifically your strong
					    opposition to the cover story
					    created to give the impression
					    there is an epidemic at the Base.
					    I understand that beyond it being
					    a matter of principle, many of
					    you are troubled by the concern
					    and anxiety this story of an
					    epidemic might cause your
					    relatives and friends on Earth.

					    I can understand and sympathize
					    with your negative views. I have
					    been personally embarrassed by
					    this cover story. But I fully
					    accept the need for absolute
					    secrecy and I hope you will.

					    It should not be difficult for all
					    of you to realise the potential for
					    cutural shock and social
					    disorientation contained in the
					    present situation if the facts
					    were prematurely and suddenly
					    made public without adequate
					    preparation and conditioning.

11/25/65										 b55 

B38
CONTINUED

					    FLOYD
					    This is the view of the Council
					    and the purpose of my visit here
					    is to gather addition facts and
					    opinions on the situation and to
					    prepare a report to the Council
					    recommending when and how the
					    news should eventually be
					    announced. Are there any
					    questions?

					    MICHAELS
					    Dr. Floyd, how long do you think
					    this can be kept under wraps?

					    FLOYD
					    (pleasantly)
					    I'm afraid it can and it will be
					    kept under wraps as long as it
					    is deemed to be necessary by
					    the Council. And of course you
					    know that the Council has requested
					    that formal security oaths are to
					    be obtained in writing from every-
					    one who had any knowledge of this
					    event. There must be adequate
					    time for a full study to be made
					    of the situation before any con-
					    sideration can be given to
					    making a public announcement.

					    FLOYD
					    Any ideas about the colour?

					    MICHAELS
					    Well, not really. At first glance,

					    FLOYD
					    Has it been exposed to any sun

VARIOUS SHOTS OF

					    NARRATOR
					    A hundred million miles beyond
					    Mars, in the cold lonliness
					    where no man had yet travelled,
					    Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts
					    slowly among the tangled orbits
					    of the asteroids.

					    NARRATOR
					    Radiation detectors noted and
					    analyzed incoming cosmic rays
					    from the galaxy and points beyond;
					    neutron and x-ray telescopes
					    kept watch on strange stars that
					    no human eye would eever see;
					    magnetometers observed the
					    gusts and hurricanes of the solar
					    winds, as the sun breathed million
					    mile-an-hour blasts of plasma
					    into the faces of its circling
					    children.

					    NARRATOR
					    All these things and many others
					    were patiently noted by Deep-
					    Space-Monitor-79, and recorded
					    in its crystalline memory.

11/25/65										 b68 

B47
CONTINUED

					    NARRATOR
					    But now it had noted something
					    strange - the faint yet
					    unmistakable distrubance rippling
					    across the solar system, and
					    quite unlike any natural phenomena
					    it had ever observed in the past.

					    NARRATOR
					    It was also observed by Orbiter
					    M-15, circling Mars twice a
					    day; and High Inclination Probe-
					    21, climbing slowly above the
					    planet of the ecliptic; and even
					    artificial Comet-5, heading out
					    into the cold wastes beyond
					    Pluto, along an orbit whose
					    far point it would not reach for
					    a thousand years.

					    NARRATOR
					    All noticed the peculiar burst of
					    energy that leaped from the face
					    of the Moon and moved across
					    the solar system, throwing off a
					    spray of radiation like the wake of
					    a racing speedboat.

POOLE IS FINISHED.

BOWMAN IS STILL
READING AND
WORKING ON HIS
DESSERT.

					    POOLE
					    Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like
					    your advice on something.

					    BOWMAN
					    Sure, what is it?

					    POOLE
					    Well, it's nothing really important,
					    but it's annoying.

					    BOWMAN
					    What's up?

					    POOLE
					    It's about my salary cheques.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes?

					    POOLE
					    Well I got the papers on my
					    official up-grading to AGS-19
					    two weeks before we left.

12/14/65										 c12 

C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes, I remember you mentioning it.
					    I got mine about the same time.

					    POOLE
					    That's right. Well, naturally,
					    I didn't say anything to Payroll.
					    I assumed they'd start paying me
					    at the higher grade on the next pay
					    cheque. But it's been almost
					    three weeks now and I'm still
					    being paid as an AGS-18.

					    BOWMAN
					    Interesting that you mention it,
					    because I've got the same problem.

					    POOLE
					    Really.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes.

					    POOLE
					    Yesterday, I finally called the
					    Accounting Office at Mission
					    Control, and all they could tell me
					    was that they'd received the AGS-19
					    notification for the other three but
					    not mine, and apparently not yours
					    either.

12/14/65										 c13 

C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Did they have any explanation for
					    this?

					    POOLE
					    Not really. They just said it might
					    be because we trained at Houston and
					    they trained in Marshall, and that
					    we're being charged against differ-
					    ent accounting offices.

					    BOWMAN
					    It's possible.

					    POOLE
					    Well, what do you think we ought
					    to do about it?

					    BOWMAN
					    I don't think we should make any
					    fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll
					    straighten it out.

					    POOLE
					    I must say, I never did understand
					    why they split us into two groups
					    for training.

					    BOWMAN
					    No. I never did, either.

12/14/65										 c14 

C12
CONTINUED

					    POOLE
					    We spent so little time with them,
					    I have trouble keeping their names
					    straight.

					    BOWMAN
					    I suppose the idea was specialized
					    training.

					    POOLE
					    I suppose so. Though, of course,
					    there's a more sinister explanation.

					    BOWMAN
					    Oh?

					    POOLE
					    Yes. You must have heard the
					    rumour that went around during
					    orbital check-out.

					    BOWMAN
					    No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.

					    POOLE
					    Oh, well, apparently there's
					    something about the mission that
					    the sleeping beauties know that
					    we don't know, and that's why we
					    were trained separately and
					    that's why they were put to sleep
					    before they were even taken aboard.

12/14/65										 c15 

C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Well, what is it?

					    POOLE
					    I don't know. All I heard is that
					    there's something about the
					    mission we weren't told.

					    BOWMAN
					    That seems very unlikely.

					    POOLE 
					    Yes, I thought so.

					    BOWMAN
					    Of course, it would be very easy
					    for us to find out now.

					    POOLE
					    How?

					    BOWMAN
					    Just ask Hal. It's conceivable
					    they might keep something from
					    us, but they'd never keep anything
					    from Hal.

					    POOLE
					    That's true.

12/14/65										 c15a 

C12						   
CONINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    (sighs)  Well... it's silly, but...
					    if you want to, why don't you?

POOLE WALKS TO THE
HAL 9000 COMPUTER

					    POOLE
					    Hal... Dave and I believe that
					    there's something about the
					    mission that we weren't told.
					    Something that the rest of the
					    crew know and that you know.
					    We'd like to know whether this
					    is true.

					    HAL
					    I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't
					    think I can answer that question
					    without knowing everything that
					    all of you know.

					    BOWMAN
					    He's got a point.

					    POOLE
					    Okay, then how do we re-phrase
					    the question?

12/14/65										 c15c	  

C12 
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Still, you really don't believe it,
					    do you?

					    POOLE
					    Not really. Though, it is strange
					    when you think about it. It didn't
					    really make any sense to keep
					    us apart during training.

					    BOWMAN
					    Yes, but it's to fantastic to think
					    that they'd keep something from us.

					    POOLE
					    I know. It would be almost
					    inconceivable.

					    BOWMAN
					    But not completely inconceivable?

					    POOLE
					    I suppose it isn't logically impossible.

					    BOWMAN
					    I guess it isn't.

					    POOLE
					    Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.

12/14/65										 c15b
 
C12
CONTINUED

					    BOWMAN
					    Well, the only important aspect of
					    the mission are: where are we
					    going, what will we do when we
					    get there, when are we coming
					    back, and... why are we going?

					    POOLE
					    Right. Hal, tell me whether the
					    following statements are true or
					    false.

					    HAL
					    I will if I can, Frank.

					    POOLE
					    Our Mission Profile calls for
					    Discovery going to Saturn.
					    True or false?

					    HAL
					    True.

					    POOLE
					    Our transit time is 257 days. Is
					    that true?

					    HAL
					    That's true.

12/14/65										 c15d
 
C12
CONTINUED

					    POOLE
					    At the end of a hundred days of
					    exploration, we will all go into 
					    hibernation. Is this true?

					    HAL
					    That's true.

					    POOLE
					    Approximately five years after we
					    go into hibernation, the recovery
					    vehicle will make rendezous with
					    us and bring us back. Is this true?

					    HAL
					    That's true

					    POOLE
					    There is no other purpose for this
					    mission than to carry out a
					    continuation of the space program,
					    and to further our general
					    knowledge of the planets. Is that
					    true?

					    HAL
					    That's true.

					    POOLE
					    Thank you very much, Hal.

12/14/65										 c15e

					    HAL
					    I hope I've been able to be of
					    some help.

					    I wouldn't worry too much about

					    there is still a chance that he
					    is right, despite your tests,
					    and if it should happen again,
					    we suggest eliminating this
					    possibility by allowing the unit
					    to remain in place and seeing
					    whether or not it actually fails.

					    If the computer should turn out
					    to be wrong, the situation is
					    still not alarming. The type
					    of obsessional error he may be
					    guilty of is not unknown among
					    the latest generation of HAL
					    9000 computers.

					    It has almost always revolved
					    around a single detail, such as
					    the one you have described, and
					    it has never interfered with the
					    integrity or reliability of the
					    computer's performance in
					    other areas.

					    No one is certain of the cause
					    of this kind of malfunctioning.

					    Hello, Dave. I think we may be on

					    We believe it all started about two

					    The purpose of this mission is no

					    and further our general knowledge
					    of the planets. Is this true?

					    HAL'S VOICE
					    That is true.

					    SIMONSON
					    Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying.
					    He had been programmed to lie
					    about this one subject for secur-
					    ity reasons which we'll explain
					    later.

					    The true purpose of the Mission
					    was to have been explained to you
					    by Mission Commander Kaminsky,
					    on his revival. Hal knew this and
					    he knew the actual mission, but
					    he couldn't tell you the truth when

					    from earth he was forced to lie.

					    In everything except this he had
					    the usual reinforced truth program-

					    We believe his truth programming
					    and the instructions to lie,
					    gradually resulted in an
					    incompatible conflict, and
					    facedc with this dilemman, he
					    developed, for want of a better
					    description, neurotic symptoms.

					    It's not difficult to suppose that
					    these symptoms would centre on
					    the communication link with
					    Earth, for he may have blamed
					    us for his incompatible program-
					    ming.

					    Following this lin of thought, we
					    suspected that the last straw for him
					    was the possibility of disconnection.
					    Since he became operational, he had
					    never known unconsciousness. It
					    must have seemed the equivalent to
					    death.

					    At this point, he, presumably,

					    If I cane speak in human terms,
					    I don't think we can blame him
					    too much. We have ordered him
					    to disobey his conscience.

					    Well, that's it. It's very
					    speculative, but we think it is

FLOYD'S RECORDED
BRIEFING

					    FLOYD
					    Good day, gentlemen. When you
					    see this briefing, I presume you
					    will be nearing your destination,
					    Saturn. I hope that you've had a
					    pleasant and uneventful trip and
					    that the rest of your mission
					    continues in the same manner. I
					    should like to fill you in on some
					    more of the details on which
					    Mission Commander Kaminsky
					    will have already briefed you.

					    Thirteen months before the launch
					    date of your Saturn mission, on
					    April 12th, 2001, the first evidence
					    for intelligent life outside the Earth
					    was discovered.

					    It was found buried at a depth of
					    fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.
					    No news of this was ever announced,
					    and the event had been kept
					    secret since then, for reasons which
					    I will later explain.

					    Soon after it was uncovered, it
					    emitted a powerful blast of
										 (con't)

12/13/65										 c124

					    FLOYD (con't)
					    radiation in the radio spectrum
					    which seems to have triggered
					    by the Lunar sunrise.

					    Luckily for those at the site, it
					    proved harmless.

					    Perhaps you can imagine our
					    astonishment when we later found
					    it was aimed precisely at Saturn.
					    A lot of thought went into the
					    question of wether or not it was
					    sun-triggered, as it seemed
					    illogical to deliberately bury a
					    sun-powered device.

					    Burying it could only shield it
					    from the sun, since its intense
					    magnetic field made it otherwise
					    easily detectable.

					    We finally concluded that the only
					    reason you might bury a sun-
					    powered device would be to keep
					    it inactive until it would be
					    uncovered, at which time it would
					    absorb sunlight and trigger itself.

					    What is its purpose?  I wish we
					    knew. The object was buried on
					    the moon about four million years
					    ago, when our ancestors were
					    primative man-apes.

					    We've examined dozens of theories,
					    but the one that has the most
					    currency at the moment is that
					    the object serves as an alarm.

					    What the purpose of the alarm is,
					    why they wish to have the alarm,
					    whether the alarm represents
					    any danger to us?  These are
					    questions no one can answer.
					    The intentions of an alien world,
					    at least four million years older
					    than we are, cannot be reliably
					    predicted.

					    In view of this, the intelligence
					    and scientific communities felt
					    that any public announcment
					    might lead to significant cultural
					    shock and disorientation.

					    Discussion took place at the 
					    highest levels between govern-

					    ments, and it was decided that the
					    only wise and precautionary
					    course to follow was to assume
					    that the intentions of this alien
					    world are potentially dangerous
					    to us, until we have evidence to
					    the contrary.

					    This is, of course, why security
					    has been maintained and why
					    this information has been kept
					    on a need-to-know basis.

					    And now I should like to show you

					    In their explorations, they
					    encountered life in many forms,

					    They saw how often the first faint

					    Earth was not forgotten, but it was

					    Not one of them ever looked through
					    his own eyes upon the planet Earth
					    again.

					    But even the age of the Machine
					    Entities passed swiftly. In their
					    ceaseless experimenting, they
					    had learned to store knowledge
					    in the structure of space itself,
					    and to preserve their thoughts
					    for eternity in frozen lattices
					    of light. They could become
					    creatures of radiation, free
					    at last from the tyranny of matter.

					    Now, they were Lords of the

					    The companion of Saturn knew

					    It had only to remember and wait,

					    For many weeks, it had watched
					    the approaching ship. Its long-
					    dead makers had prepared it for
					    many things and this was one of
					    them. And it recognised what
					    was climbing starward from the

					    Presently, it felt the gentle touch

                       Watch out!
          
          But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the
          puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.
          
          In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The
          driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.
          
          The sign at the door reads: `Institute for Astrophysics -
          University of New Delhi'.
          
                                                                        2.
          
          INT. NAGA-DENG MINE/INDIA - SUNSET
          
          An endless mine shaft. An old elevator cage comes to a
          grinding halt. When Prof. West steps out we see that he is
          accompanied now by a nervous DR. SATNAM TSURUTANI, 32.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    How deep are we?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    8200 feet. Used to be an old copper
                    mine, Professor, sir.
          
          As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting
          for this science lab.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Helmsley told me that the neutrino
                    count doubled during the last sun
                    eruptions.
          
                                     SATNAM
                    Correct, sir. But that is not what
                    worries me...
          
          They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small
          group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all
          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    There was a new solar storm, so strong
                    that the physical reaction got even
                    more severe.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    How can that be?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    We don't know, Professor, sir.
          
          Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch
          on the floor and hot steam rises.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    The neutrinos suddenly act like...
                    microwaves.
          
          Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the
          water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING
          
          A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is
          spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and
          the Capitol Building.
          
          ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL
          AIDES. He is the only African-American among them.
          
          One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief
          of Staff, working the crowd.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #1
                    Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he
                    was President. Did you hear, he wants
                    us to sign in and out like school boys?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I still can't believe that Wilson chose
                    him of all people to run the White
                    House.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and
                    the Congress.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Shame he's such a pompous ass.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    Somebody mention my name?
          
          Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (SHOCKED)
                    Yes sir... No, sir.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    Which one is it?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    We were talking about what a great
                    speech you gave tonight. Well done,
                    sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember
                    that.
          
          Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    That guy scares the shit out of me.
          
          At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings.

                    Professor West?
          
                                     PROF. WEST (O.S.)
                    I've been trying to reach you!
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Prof. West is on the phone. In the background we make out
          Satnam's family around the dining room table.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Listen, Adrian. The situation is much
                    worse than we thought...
          
          Satnam quiets his little son. It is the boy we saw earlier
          with his toy ship.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House,
          papers in hand.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Sir, the President needs to know this.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Helmsley, how long have you been on the
                    job as science advisor?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Four months this week.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    I would   say that's enough time to learn
                    that we   have rules here. You'll just
                    have to   wait until the quarterly
                    science   briefing.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    If this is about what I said last
                    night, I am truly sorry, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So you didn't like my speech?
          
          Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Can you please have a look at this,
                    sir? It's really important.
          
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)

          Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts
          to walk away, reading.
          
          Suddenly he slows down.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                    Who wrote this?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    An Indian astrophysicist I graduated
                    with from Harvard and Prof. West, the
                    preeminent geologist in the US.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Who else knows about it?
          
                                      ADRIAN
                    No one, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.
          
          Anheuser walks away.

          G8 Summit. Riot police control the unruly crowd with water
          cannons.
          
          We see PROTESTERS with Anti Globalization signs behind a
          fence. A convoy of limousines is approaching a historic
          building.
          
          
          INT. BIG HALL/ALHAMBRA - DAY
          
          We follow the American delegation into the conference room,
          where the other G8 delegations are seated around an enormous
          table.
          
          The President of the United States, THOMAS F. WILSON, 56,
          doesn't sit down. He addresses the room and everybody goes
          quiet.
          
                                      PRESIDENT WILSON (O.S.)
                    Good Morning...
          
          For the first time we see the President's face. He is African-
          American.

                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    I hereby present a motion to meet
                    privately with my seven fellow Heads of
                    State, kindly excluding the rest of the
                    delegates.
          
          A murmur erupts. The Russian President SERGEY MAKARENKO, 62,
          whispers to one of his interpreters.
          
                                     RUSSIAN INTERPRETER
                    Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his
                    interpreters present.
          
          President Wilson looks over to the Russian Colleague.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Mr. President, judging from the
                    conversations we've had in the past, I
                    can assure you, your English is
                    absolutely fine, for what I have to
                    say.
          
          As the Russian President waves his interpreter away, all the
          international delegates leave as well.
          
          The huge doors of the hall close. A secret service officer in
          the sound booth switches off the recording equipment to the
          chamber.
          
          The President gathers himself.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Six months ago I was made aware of a
                    situation so devastating, that at
                    first, I refused to believe it.
                            (PAUSE)
                    However through the concerted efforts
                    of the brightest scientists of several
                    nations, we have now confirmed its
                    validity.
          
          Dead silence.

          with his PARENTS, both in their 60's.
          
          
          EXT. SCHOOL/TIBET - DAY
          
          Neng's older brother, LIN PANG, 25, is part of a huge crowd
          of young men and women staying behind by a Tibetan school
          building. He turns and yells after the truck.
          
                                     LIN
                    I will send you money mother.
          
          The Colonel with the dark glasses steps up, addressing the
          masses.

          Eager hands fly up in the air. An official makes notes.

          Lin's hand shoots up in the air. We hear a siren echoing
          through the mountains and suddenly an explosion. Lin turns.
          
          In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous
          holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock
          everywhere.

          A MAN in a dark suit walks through a hallway of the

          plush and luxurious. He's stopped by two security men who
          frisk him.

          A group of dark figures in overalls walk past famous
          Renaissance paintings. They stop at the Mona Lisa.
          
          MANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums,
          stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late
          20's. They observe the specialists opening the case of the
          famous painting.

                    your people.

          Laura answers in almost perfect French.
          
                                     LAURA
                    There are too many crazy people who
                    could hurt her, Manfred. The World
                    Heritage Foundation has done this all
                    over the world.
          
          In the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and
          replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy.
          He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight
          case.
          
                                     MANFRED PICARD
                    And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in
                    the Swiss Alps?
          
                                      LAURA
                    Perfectly safe.
          
          Picard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN
          on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her
          mysterious smile.

          INT. JACKSON'S APARTMENT/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING
          
          A shabby apartment in Silverlake. The TV is on.

                    recorded history... 
          
          A small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face
          of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell
          asleep at his laptop last night.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Oh no. Not again.
          
          One look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some
          clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not
                    late. It's not even 10:30...
          
          Jackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping
          only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he
          stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and
          identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Damn it!
                            (into the phone)
                    Kate, I'm on my way... For god's
                    sake...
          
          Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold
          on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on
          their back covers.
          
          
          EXT. JACKSON'S GARAGE/LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING
          
          The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door,
          struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    They're kids, Kate, going on vacation.
                    It's not a doctor's appointment... it's
                    supposed to be fun. You remember that,
                    right? Fun?
          
          He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead.
          Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel.
          
                                                                       11.

          Jackson runs across the street with his camping equipment,
          throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the
          curb.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    ... I know it's mosquito season at
                    Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on
                    the way.
          
          He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an
          elderly couple, stand there and stare at it.
          
                                     NEIGHBOR
                    Merrill, we should move back to
                    Wisconsin.
          
          Jackson gets into the limo and speeds off.

          Jackson drives through LA with the radio on.

                    like these so called `mini-quakes'...
          
          Jackson passes a man in a wheelchair. He's holding up a
          cardboard sign: `Repent - The End is Near'.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson stops and honks in front of an upscale Westwood home.

          Jackson switches the radio off. Two kids NOAH, 10, and LILLY,
          7, come running down the driveway. They slow down, as they
          see the limo.
          
                                     NOAH

          Lilly yells from inside the limo.

          Their mother, KATE CURTIS, 32, a beautiful woman appears.

                    So what, you're a chauffeur now? What

                    Of course.
          
          Kate's new boyfriend, GORDON SILBERMAN, 43, pulls out of the
          garage in his Porsche wearing his Bluetooth.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (on the phone)
                    Simone, how many times have I told you,

                    messy.
          
          Jackson smiles bitterly. Gordon waves at the kids.

                    Nice car.
          
          Jackson waves grudgingly as Gordon pulls away.

          She follows Jackson to the car with a bag of pull-up diapers.

          He shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel. She looks
          at him seriously.

                    forward to this you know. Don't let
                    them down.
          
          He nods as the car pulls away.

          HARRY HELMSLEY, 73, and his partner TONY DELGADO, 68, board
          an enormous cruise ship, the `Freedom of the Seas'. Harry is
          African-American, Tony is Italian. He carries a large case.
          They pass a poster: `Jazz Night with Harry Helmsley & Tony
          Delgado'.
          
                                     HARRY
                    So this time we'll hit the Japs.
          
                                    TONY
                    So what?
          
                                     HARRY
                    Well Tony, electronics are cheap there
                    and... you could visit your boy Will.

                    Afternoon ladies...
          
          TONY shoots a charmers smile at a couple of older single
          ladies on sun loungers. They smile back coyly.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Are you even listening to me?
          
                                     TONY
                    Yes unfortunately I am Harry.
          
                                     HARRY
                    I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa
                    now.
          
                                     TONY
                    Why don't you keep your nose out of my
                    family. You're cramping my style.
          
                                     HARRY
                    He married a Japanese girl - how is
                    that the end of the world? You should
                    at least go see him.

                                     TONY
                    Why? Do you see your boy?
          
                                     HARRY
                    Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long
                    way. But at least we talk.
          
                                       TONY
                    What about?
          
                                     HARRY
                    Life, how short it is...
          
          Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that
          pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the
          landing, about ten yards.
          
          The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an
          earthshaking BOOM.
          
                                     TONY
                    What the hell was that?
          
          A murmur goes through the crowd. Luckily nobody is injured.

          answers the phone.

                    I had my suspicions. I should have said
                    something. They are following me.

          A puddle of water is all that remains of the lake. Jackson

          THROUGH BINOCULARS.
          
          Jackson spots an electronic measuring device and crouches to
          have a closer look.
          
          Elsewhere in the lake bed, we see sand seeping through CRACKS
          in the ground.

          Through the BINOCULARS, we see Jackson and his kids arrested
          and led over a ridge.
          
          With this we reveal an ENORMOUS RESEARCH FACILITY with
          hundreds of tents and vehicles surrounding a massive drilling
          tower.
          
          
          EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Adrian Helmsley and Prof. West exit the drilling tower, both
          studying papers. Adrian notices Jackson and his kids nearby,
          being interrogated by an OFFICER.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I'll be with you in a second,
                    Professor.
          
          Adrian walks towards them. Jackson stares at the officer with
          defiance.
          
                                     OFFICER
                    ... And then you climbed over a posted
                    fence? Just like that?
          
                                       NOAH
                    I told you.

                                     JACKSON
                    Isn't this supposed to be a National
                    Park? There shouldn't be fences. What
                    are you guys doing around here anyway?
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    We're geologists...
          
          Jackson turns and sees Adrian standing there.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll handle this officer. Thank you.
          
          The officer reluctantly hands him Jackson's license.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    So, where did the lake go?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    That's what we're trying to find out.
                    We think this whole area has become
                    potentially unstable. I would advise
                    you to take your kids and leave, Mr...
          
          He throws a look at Jackson's drivers license.
          
                                    ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    ... Curtis.
          
          He looks up at Jackson with renewed interest.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Are you by any chance the Jackson
                    Curtis, the author of `Farewell
                    Atlantis'?
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SURPRISED)
                    Yeah, that's me.
          
          Jackson straightens up proudly. Lilly smiles.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What a coincidence. I'm reading your
                    book, as we speak... first third,
                    around day 300, when the shuttle loses
                    communication with earth and drifts off
                    into space.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Actually I didn't buy it. My father
                    gave it to me.

                                    JACKSON
                    Oh, I see.
          
          Prof. West waves at Adrian from one of the container labs.
          Adrian hands back Jackson his drivers license.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Officer, can you return them to the
                    campgrounds, please.
                            (to Jackson)
                    Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
          
          Jackson and his kids look after Adrian hurrying away.
          
                                     LILLY
                    He was very nice.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Yes he was, Lil'bee.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST TRAIL/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - LATER
          
          Jackson and the kids walk back to the campgrounds when
          suddenly CHARLIE FROST, 62, a crazy looking guy with
          binoculars around his neck, stands in their way.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    What did the government guys tell you?
          
          Jackson looks at him, instinctively picking up Lilly.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    They think it's not such a good idea to
                    climb over their fences. They feel the
                    area is unstable.
          
          Charlie bursts out laughing.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable!
                    That's funny...
          
          With this he turns around and leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TENT/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Jackson is sitting on a camp chair, right outside the tent.
          He's on his laptop, looking enquiringly at an aerial picture
          of Yellowstone on Google earth.
          
          In the background we see the kids are in the tent.

                                     NOAH
                    There are mosquitos in here. Did
                    anybody spray the tent?
          
          Jackson looks up, remembering he forgot the spray.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We'll get some of that tomorrow. For
                    tonight just put your head under the
                    blankie.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Daddy you said you weren't gonna work
                    on your book.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you
                    wearing your pull-ups?
          
          Lilly nods as Jackson walks over and tucks her into bed. He
          kisses her good night. He turns and is surprised to see Noah
          typing a text on his cell phone.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Did mommy buy you that?
          
                                     NOAH
                    No... Gordon gave it to me for my
                    birthday.
          
          Jackson takes the phone from out of Noah's hands.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Noah. Things like a cell phone have to
                    be discussed in the family.
          
                                       NOAH

                    What family?
          
          Jackson reads the message Noah has typed `Hey Gordon, Camping
          Sucks!'. Hurt, Jackson hands back the phone.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Go to sleep guys.

          as they board a chopper. Adrian is on the phone.

          A second later the chopper lifts off.
          
          
          INT. LIMO/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DUSK
          
          Jackson has his laptop open with the cursor blinking away on
          the words `Chapter Seven'. But he can't concentrate on
          writing after what Noah has said.
          
          A chopper flies overhead. Jackson follows it's path over the
          campsite and his eyes fall on an American flag fluttering on
          top of a massive radio antennae. This belongs to an RV truck.
          
          Through the RV's window, Jackson sees the silhouette of
          Charlie Frost, the guy with the binoculars, speaking into a
          microphone.
          
          Curious, Jackson flicks on the radio and twists the dial.

                    I wanted to know, where will this all
                    start?
          
          Jackson is intrigued. He puts his laptop down.

                    Bill.
          
          Jackson climbs out of his car and starts towards the RV. He
          can still hear the radio.

          a knock on the door. Jackson sticks his head in.

          A crudely animated film starts to play. Charlie narrates on
          screen in an overly dramatic fashion.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event
                    will unfold. Caused by an alignment of
                    the planets in our solar system that
                    only happens every 640,000 years...
                    Just imagine the earth as an Orange...
          
          Charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    ... our sun will begin to emit such
                    extreme amounts of radiation, that the
                    core of the earth will melt - that's
                    the inside part of the Orange, leaving
                    the crust of our planet free to shift.
          
          On screen the middle of the orange shrinks, now the skin
          moves freely around it.

          A faded portrait of a scientist appears on screen.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST

                    The forces of mother nature will be so
                    devastating it will bring an end to
                    this world on winter solstice 12-21-12.
          
          The film ends with an image of the whole earth covered with
          water.
          
          Charlie shuts the laptop.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Pretty neat, huh? It's a big hit on
                    YouTube. I did the animation myself.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I know what you're thinking. But all
                    the governments know about this.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    If they all knew, don't you think
                    somebody would tell us?

                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    They can't. Just think about it. First
                    the stockmarket would crash...
          
          Charlie opens a can of beer. Phsssh!
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Then the economy... boom. The dollar...
                    boom. And then the people in the
                    streets...
                            (mimicking gun fire)
                    Boom, boom! Pandemonium, revolution,
                    war! They would never tell us. Beer?
          
          Jackson shakes his head still struggling to digest this.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates,
                    or maybe one of those Russian
                    billionaires do you stand a chance to
                    buy a seat.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    A seat?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                            (INTENSELY)
                    They're building spaceships, man.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Oh... I see.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    No really... One of my listeners, a
                    geography professor at UTSC, has even
                    figured out where they're building
                    them. He sent me a map.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My
                    kids are sleeping.
          
          Charlie looks at him bug eyed.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's
                    gonna get ugly here.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Night, Charlie.
          
          As Jackson exits, Charlie gets back on the air.

                    Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in
                    times like these, a man has got to
                    eat...

          EXT. PARKING LOT OF SUPERMARKET/LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
          
          Westwood. The parking lot of Gelson's is nearly empty.
          
          Eerie silence. Suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in
          place from an unseen force. A small CRACK creases the asphalt
          and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket.
          
          
          INT. BETWEEN AISLES/SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
          
          Muzak is playing. Kate and her boyfriend Gordon are shopping
          late. She picks up some pull-ups for Lilly, Gordon steps up
          behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Why don't we make a baby?
          
          He reaches up and touches her breasts.
          
                                     KATE
                    Stop it! We're in public.
          
          Gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Honey, I created them. And now suddenly
                    I can't touch them?
          
          Kate pushes him away and moves on.
          
          A few customers are paying at the checkout stand.
          
          BEHIND THEM: Huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding
          into the ever widening crack in the parking lot. Nobody
          inside notices.
          
          Gordon catches up with Kate.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    You always act strange after he shows
                    up?
          
                                     KATE
                    Just because I don't care for your
                    arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting
                    strange. He is the father of my kids.

                                     GORDON
                    Maybe biologically. Can I remind you
                    what that guy did? First you gave up
                    med school to have Noah... Then you
                    practically raise him and Lilly by
                    yourself while he sat glued to a laptop
                    writing that junk.
          
                                     KATE
                    Some of his stuff is actually... He's
                    published Gordon.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (MOCKINGLY)
                    Yeah, published! You know your mother
                    was right. You've always been drawn to
                    guys with lofty dreams and empty
                    pockets. But not this time right,
                    sweetheart?
          
          Kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup. The shelf
          in front of her shakes for a moment.
          
                                     KATE
                    Did you see that?
          
                                    GORDON
                    See what?
          
          Kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks
          around. Gordon senses a problem between them.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    You know Kate, we have to keep working
                    at this... our relationship. Because I
                    won't end up being just a re-run of you
                    and Jackson.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I mean Honey, I feel like... something
                    is pulling us apart?
          
          Before Gordon finishes his sentence--
          
          A violent ROAR! From front to back, the entire supermarket
          rips open right between Kate and Gordon.
          
          The few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge
          crevasse forming beneath them. Kate and Gordon are thrown up
          against opposite aisles holding on for dear life.
          
          They cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever
          widening crack...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Jackson puts down some groceries at the checkout.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Just stop scratching. You'll get them
                    infected.
          
          He smiles at the female cashier behind the counter who does
          not look friendly.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Something for Mosquito bites please?
          
                                       CASHIER

                    What?
          
          The woman looks at Lilly and Noah with their red lumps.
          
                                     CASHIER
                    I'd get before and after.
          
          She slams two mosquito products on the counter.

                    That's our supermarket.

                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Is this even possible? What's our

                                     ANHEUSER
                    They estimate four of the ships will be
                    ready for launch.
          
          The President is shocked by this news.

                    I'd rather have Adrian do that. They
                    trust him. I told him to be in on the
                    meeting.

          Flat screens line the walls. A video conference is under way
          with each of the G8 members represented.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this
                    day would come. But we never imagined
                    it would come this soon.
          
          He looks over to Adrian.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    I would like to pass this over to my
                    science advisor, Adrian Helmsley.
          
          Adrian steps up and gathers himself. Anheuser watches.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I'll make this brief...

                    Yellowstone, the temperature of the

                    world. Here he is... Mister Zultan
                    Balashin!
          
          The crowd ROARS as the boxer and his entourage enter.
          
          The CAMERA moves in on a tall man with blonde clean cut hair.
          He is well built, wearing designer clothing from head to toe.
          YURI KARPOV, 45, stereotypical Russian oligarch.
          
          He approaches the ringside corner and whistles.
          
                                       YURI
                    Zultan!
          
          The nervous boxer turns.
          
                                     ZULTAN
                            (in Russian)
                    Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would
                    not see you.
          
          Yuri hits the boxer's gloves. Zultan is nervous. His coach
          steps in.
          
                                     COACH
                    He needs to concentrate now, Mister
                    Karpov.
          
                                     YURI
                    You shut up... when I talk to my boy,
                    understand?
          
                                       COACH
                    Yes, Mr. Karpov.
          
                                     YURI
                    Good... That is good.
                            (in Russian to the
                             BOXER)
                    Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are
                    fighters. We never go down. We always
                    stay on our feet...
          
          Zultan just keeps nodding, pumping himself up.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    ... No matter who is hitting us. No
                    matter how hard.
          
          GONG. First Round. The fight is on.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)

          Yuri walks to his seat, sitting down next to his trophy:
          
          TAMARA, 28, blonde, wears the shortest mini one can imagine,
          designer shoes, handbag, glasses and boobs. In her lap she
          holds CAESAR, a tiny dog wearing a diamond collar.
          
          In the ring the boxers maul at each other. Yuri's cell phone
          beeps. It's a text message:
          
          START BOARDING PROCEDURE
          
          Yuri's whole demeanor changes. Without a word, he gets up and
          walks out of the arena.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Yuri bear... where are you going?
          
          Yuri does not respond as he squeezes through the crowd.
          
          Zultan, the boxer, notices Yuri leave. In that split second
          distraction, he is hit HARD and goes down for the count.
          
          The crowd ROARS!

          Kate heads to the car. Still sleepy, the kids grab their

          Tamara hovers in the background packing her Louis Vuitton

          EXT. MANSION/BEL AIR - MORNING
          
          A palatial home. Completely gaudy. The twins, ALEC and OLEG,
          wait impatiently. They are 12 years old and wear identical
          clothing by Dior.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Curtis, you are late.
          
          Jackson ignores him and starts throwing the luggage into the
          limo. The other twin notices his muddy sneakers.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Careful with our stuff. Don't get it
                    dirty.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Ahead of the limo a crowd has formed in the streets, singing
          songs and chanting about the end of days. A SKINNY MAN with a
          ponytail preaches from the scriptures.
          
                                     PREACHER
                    ... There will be famines, pestilences
                    and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord.
          
          Jackson has to maneuver through the people. Banners read:
          `Prepare for the End'-- 'You cannot escape his judgement'--
          
          Alec looks up from his video game, annoyed.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Curtis, can't you go faster?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Are you guys blind? I can't run people
                    over.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Why not? They're idiots anyway.
          
          Jackson shoots these spoilt brats an angry look.
          
                                                                      35.
          
          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson stops in front of the Gulfstream. SASHA, 40, Yuri's
          Russian pilot is expecting them.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
          
          Jackson mutters under his breath as he unloads the luggage,
          dropping one of them on Alec's foot on purpose.
          
                                     ALEC
                    Ouch! Be more careful!
          
          The other twin has noticed Jackson's intensions. He gets into
          his face.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are
                    going on a big ship.
                            (PAUSE)
                    We will live... and you will die.
          
          Oleg grins back at Jackson as the jet door closes. The
          Gulfstream taxis onto the runway.
          
          As Jackson turns back to the car a fine surface crack shoots
          across the tarmac. We hold on his face as it hits him like a
          ton of bricks:
          
          THE CRAZY RADIO HOST, CHARLIE FROST WAS RIGHT!
          
          Frantically Jackson looks around and spots a MAN in overalls
          working on a twin engine Cessna. He runs to him.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Where can I rent a plane?
          
          The man points to a shabby office building.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Kate is in her kitchen cooking breakfast for the kids. Gordon
          watches the Governor on the news.
          
                                     GOVERNOR
                            (with Austrian
                             ACCENT)
                    ... just this morning my people at
                    Caltech told me that in the last 36
                    hours we had basically zero earthquake
                    activity in Southern California, which
                    is very rare...

          The phone rings. Kate picks up.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson drives like crazy.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    ... Kate, we have to get out of LA!
                    I've rented a plane for us. Get the
                    kids ready! I'll be there in five.
          
                                     KATE
                    The kids have plans today...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Are you kidding me!
          
                                     KATE
                    No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and
                    Lil' has Karate.
          
          Gordon rolls his eyes and mutters.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Not that we'd expect him to remember.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SCREAMING)
                    California is going down! Pack up the
                    kids!
          
                                     KATE
                    You're crazy! The Governor just said
                    we're fine now.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    The Governor's a meathead, how would he
                    know anything? Kate listen! You gotta
                    trust me over some politician. Come on.
          
          
          INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Kate slams the phone down. Lilly stops eating.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy?
          
                                     LAURA
                    Because your daddy is a lunatic,
                    darling.
          
          On the TV, the interview comes to an end.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                     GOVERNOR
                    ... it looks to me, like the worst is
                    over.
          
          That moment a MASSIVE QUAKE hits Los Angeles.
          
          Everybody dives under the table.
          
          ON TV: The news casters and the Governor do the same. A few
          seconds later the signal cuts out.
          
          Gordon pulls Kate and the kids close as the earth shakes
          violently for 20 seconds.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson flies into the driveway and runs into the house.
          
          
          INT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          When he enters, Lilly immediately runs into his arms. The
          next tremor hits. Cracks form on the kitchen floor.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We have to leave! Noah, let's go!
          
                                     KATE
                    I think we're safer here!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Noah, now! Kate please...
          
          The whole house rides up and down like on a wave.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I think he's right.
          
          Finally Kate pushes her son out from under the table. They
          all scramble out of the house in a panic. Kate is cut on the
          shoulder by falling glass but she hardly notices.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          As they storm out of their front door the house crumbles
          behind them.
          
                                      JACKSON
                    Get in the car!
          
          The whole street starts to buckle. Left and right the houses
          are shaken and smashed like toys.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Just before the wave of destruction can reach them, Jackson
          tears out of the driveway.
          
          
          EXT. STREETS/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson maneuver's the limo through the crumbling
          neighborhood. Right in front of their eyes, streets
          disappear, trees fall, electrical lines snap. Sewer pipes
          burst in front of the car.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Holy shit!
          
          Jackson has to turn on the windshield wipers.
          
          
          EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          The limo crashes through a gate onto the tarmac, coming to a
          stop in front of a twin engine Cessna.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Damn it! Where's the pilot?
          
          Kate turns to Gordon.
          
                                     KATE
                    Gordon, you know how to fly.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I... had a couple lessons...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Did you cover taking off?
          
                                     GORDON
                    Yeah.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    That's good enough for me.
          
          They start running, when Jackson remembers something and
          heads back to the Limo.
          
          He grabs his knapsack from the front seat fumbling to zip his
          laptop back inside it. Kate shouts.
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Jackson, what are you doing?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'm coming.
          
          He jumps out of the car and races back after them. Behind
          Jackson the hangar starts to disintegrate.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          
          A gigantic fissure forms in the earth, shooting towards Santa
          Monica airport.
          
          Gordon fumbles with the controls, Jackson yells from the
          copilot seat.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Come on, come on...
          
                                     GORDON
                            (pointing at the
                             INSTRUMENTS)
                    But I'm supposed to check all these
                    first...
          
          Jackson reaches over and slams Gordon's hand down and the
          plane lurches forward.
          
          As the Cessna speeds onto the tarmac the control tower goes
          down and explodes.
          
          Noah discovers the giant crevasse forming behind them.
          
                                       NOAH
                    Guys, behind us!
          
          As the plane accelerates, the giant crack closes in on them.
          Gordon's hand trembles on the throttle control. Everybody
          screams on top of each other.
          
                                     EVERYBODY
                    Gordon! Damn it! Lift off!
          
          Gordon gathers his courage and pulls the lever. The plane
          almost rockets into the air just as the ground beneath them
          gives way.
          
          They hover for a moment, almost caught in mid-air as the
          widening crevasse beneath them fights to suck them into the
          bowels of the earth. Gordon fights to maintain control but
          they begin to be pulled down.
          
          The daylight vanishes. Debris and mud smashes into the plane
          from all sides. The canyon walls erupt.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I can't get it up!
          
          Taking desperate measures, Gordon nearly rips the control
          stick out of its joint - with a lurch the Cessna lifts out of
          the abyss.
          
          
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          They all take a deep breath only to realize that now they are
          flying directly into the collapsing towers of downtown Los
          Angeles!
          
          Like a roller coaster, Gordon manages to weave the little
          plane through the tumbling high rises.
          
          They dive one last time to evade the plummeting US BANK
          TOWER, the tallest building on the west coast.
          
          All are dead silent as they watch the whole of Los Angeles
          crumble beneath them. Kate covers Lilly's eyes.
          
                                     NOAH
                            (in total shock)
                    That was amazing, Gordon!
          
          Jackson looks at Kate and notices her cut.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    Are you okay?
          
                                     KATE
                            (brushing it off)
                    I'm fine. How did you know this was
                    gonna happen?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I didn't.
                            (To Gordon)
                    Do we have enough fuel to make it to
                    Yellowstone?
          
          The plane veers off in a northeasterly direction. Behind them
          the destruction of Los Angeles continues.

                                     HARRY
                            (while still playing)
                    I'll be right there.
          
          The waiter nods. A few more bars of music, then applause.
          
                                     HARRY (CONT'D)
                            (into the microphone)
                    Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's
                    hear it for the one and only Tony
                    Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and
                    we'll be back after a short pit stop.
          
          Applause. Harry rushes off stage.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    Dad... what I have to tell you is very
                    serious...
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian is standing in a dark corner. Behind him people are
          packing up, carrying boxes.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You remember when I told you about the
                    dam in China? Well, it's happening much
                    sooner than we anticipated.
          
          
          INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY
          
          Harry's face has turned serious.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    The President has ordered us to clear
                    out the White House.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Hah... About time someone cleaned up
                    that mess.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian fights back the tears.

                                     ADRIAN
                    Where are you, dad? What exactly is the
                    course of the `Freedom' right now?...
          
                                     HARRY (O.S.)
                    It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry
                    about your old man. You have more
                    important things to do now.
          
          
          INT. GALLEY/CRUISE SHIP - DAY
          
          There's a tremor in Harry's voice.
          
                                     HARRY
                    You know, your mom and I, we had a hell
                    of a great life... and a hell of a
                    great kid too.
                            (PAUSE)
                    And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship
                    you know... Don't write your old man
                    off, just yet.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          A tear runs down Adrian's face.
          
                                     HARRY (O.S.)
                    ... Besides, I could never leave Tony
                    alone. You know how he can't keep
                    decent time by himself.
          
          Pause.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    I love you, dad.

          Harry bites his lip.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Love you too, son.
          
          
          INT. BAR/CRUISE SHIP - DAY
          
          Back in the lounge, Tony has finished his cocktail. Harry
          walks up and hollers at the barkeeper.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Hey Herb. Get me a double Jack on the
                    rocks.

                                     TONY
                    After twenty-five years on the wagon?
          
                                     HARRY
                    Why not? Who cares how long we do
                    certain things? How long we drink
                    booze, how long we talk to people... Or
                    how long we don't talk to people.
          
          Harry grabs Tony by his shirt.
          
                                     TONY
                    Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with
                    you? Let's go. We're back on.
          
          Harry pulls him even closer.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Call your kid, you stubborn old ass.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I'm not going back on that stage unless
                    you promise to call him.

                                     HARRY
                    Promise me, Tony... please.
          
          Harry stares him down.
          
                                     TONY
                    Yeah, maybe I should call him...
          
          Harry smiles, downs his bourbon and walks back on stage.

          INT. ADRIAN'S OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian enters his office. The TV is on.
          
                                     NEWS ANCHOR
                    ... There is little we know at this
                    point, but the earthquake registered at
                    10.1 on the Richter scale. The whole of
                    the Western seaboard was hit...
          
          Assistants stare at the news in shocked disbelief, some of
          them are crying. Prof. West appears at the door.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (pointing at the TV)
                    Have you seen this?

          Prof. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him
          down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall-
          sized high def monitor.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    We have satellite images. Here's the
                    sequence we've got so far.
          
          On the monitors, detailed satellite imagery displays how the
          monstrous quake unfolds, leaving California sliding into the
          sea.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Any news from Yellowstone?

          The base is abandoned but for a few structures and the
          enormous drilling tower.
          
          Gordon manages to land the plane next to what looks like a
          fueling station. Jackson leaps out checking the pump.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and
                    I'll look for Charlie.
          
                                     KATE
                    You're sure about this?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Kate, everything this guy said so far
                    has happened. I'll be right back.
          
          Jackson runs off towards the hills.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Daddy wait! I wanna come with you!
          
          Lilly runs after him. Jackson picks her up.
          
                                     KATE
                    Lilly! Come back!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    It's fine! I'll take her.
          
          Kate watches as they disappear, worried. Noah and Gordon have
          started to fuel the plane.
          
                                                                       45.

          Jackson and Lilly find Charlie's RV with it's door hanging
          open. They enter. The key is in the ignition. The radio
          transmitters are on, but Charlie is gone. Jackson fiddles
          with the switches and Charlie's voice comes on.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    ... I am standing here at the highest
                    point on what is the rim of this super
                    volcano...
          
                                     JACKSON
                    He's got to be close by, Lil'bee...
          
          Jackson jumps behind the wheel and turns the ignition.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Let's go back, Daddy.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Listen to me. We have to find Charlie.
                    He's got a secret map, you know, like
                    Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.
          
          That catches her interest.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Lil', we have to work as a team now,
                    okay? You have to help me.
          
          Jackson passes her his mobile phone. Lilly nods. He throws
          the RV into gear and they speed off over the bumpy terrain.
          
          In their dust, we see the earth fissuring!

                    any minute the fireworks will start...
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Who's in the car with you? Who's that
                    man screaming?
          
                                     LILLY
                    He's not in the car. He's on a mountain
                    waiting for fireworks.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Lilly spots Charlie way up on a ridge. He has erected his ten
          foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top.
          
                                     LILLY (CONT'D)
                            (to Jackson)
                    There he is! Up there!
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You're the best, darling. Give Daddy
                    the phone...
                            (into the phone)
                    Kate I am sorry, I can't talk...
          
          The road ends just below the mountain peak.
          
                                     KATE (O.S.)
                    Bring back my child, Jackson! NOW!
          
          Jackson sees Charlie up above, broadcasting. He hangs up the
          phone and jumps out of the RV.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You wait here for me! You watch the
                    ship while Captain Curtis talks to the
                    pirate. Okay?
          
                                       LILLY
                              (UNCERTAIN)
                    Okay...
          
          Jackson climbs up to Charlie.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Charlie has his broadcasting equipment strapped to his body.
          The antenna's flag is whipping in the wind.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                            (into his mic)
                    ... I wish you guys at home could see
                    this on TV...
          
          He notices Jackson and muffles the microphone.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    How did you make it up here? Thought
                    you were toast.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    The spaceships Charlie, where are they?
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    You can't make it there.

                                     JACKSON
                    We have a plane. We can get you out of
                    here too. Let's go Charlie!
          
          All around the landscape begins to collapse. A three mile
          crater forms, revealing the awe-inspiring sight of the super-
          volcano.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    You'll never make it out in time. Just
                    stay and enjoy the big bang. That your
                    kid?
          
          Jackson discovers Lilly standing behind him, staring at
          Charlie with her big brown eyes.
          
          Jackson grabs Charlie lifting him off the ground.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Where is that god damn map!
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't
                    know. Somewhere in my camper.
          
          A low rumble builds to a rapturous thunder as MILLIONS OF
          BIRDS tear into flight.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    Wow! Look at that!...

          The mouth of the volcano starts to break apart revealing
          molten lava underneath.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST (CONT'D)
                    ... the last of mankind. Soon they'll
                    see us from a million miles away, out
                    there in the milky way...
          
          Jackson grabs his wide eyed daughter and races down the
          mountain.
          
          
          EXT. BELOW MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Jackson and Lilly jump into the RV and races off, with
          Charlie's broadcast still playing.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE

                    First the lights will go out in Vegas,
                    then Dallas, St. Louis and then
                    Washington DC...
          
          Jackson's cell phone rings and he picks up.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're on our way.
          
          
          EXT. RESEARCH FACILITY/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
                                     KATE
                    Jackson, things are really looking bad
                    here!
          
          In that instant, the air around them vanishes, as if sucked
          from the landscape into a vacuum.
          
          THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN... At least in
          the last 640,000 years.
          
          To them, all this occurs in total silence. The sound of the
          eruption has not reached them yet.
          
          They are frozen, unable to comprehend what is happening.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The explosion begins to resembles an atomic mushroom.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    ... it's beautiful, kids! Just
                    beautiful!
          
          The sound waves reach Charlie, throwing him to the ground.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The RV flies over the rugged terrain. Everywhere the earth is
          cracking, falling apart. Jackson struggles to swerve around
          the disappearing landscape.
          
                                     LILLY

                    It's following us!
          
          Lilly has discovered the expanding ASH CLOUD behind them.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Just don't look back, Lil'bee!
          
          The THUNDERING sound envelopes them! On the radio, the voice
          of Charlie is getting shrill.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Charlie slowly tries to stand again, silhouetted against the
          cloud of dust and fire towering above him.
          
          Flaming rocks fly towards him. When they hit the ground, they
          detonate like fire bombs.
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    Oh baby! It's coming!
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Rocks plummet like comets around the RV as Jackson races over
          a collapsing bridge. On the radio, in his delirious state,
          Charlie begins to sing...
          
                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                    `This is the end, my friend'...
          
          Yellowstone looks like a war zone. The RV dodges the
          bombardment of fire and rock.
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          Huge tree trunks and glowing boulders fly at Charlie through
          the ashes. He screams at the top of his lungs.
          
                                     CHARLIE FROST
                    ... Folks, always remember, you heard
                    it first from Charlie.
          
          A second later, Charlie's radio antenna comes spinning like a
          scythe through the air. It decapitates Charlie in an instant.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          The radio cuts out. The forest and the camp grounds are mown
          flat by the extreme force of the ASH CLOUD. In the rear view
          mirror Jackson sees it gaining on them.
          
                                    JACKSON
                    LILLY! DOWN!
          
          A firebomb hits the RV, ripping half the roof off.
          
          Lilly barely makes it under the dashboard.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Stay down there, Lil'! We're almost
                    there! Just keep looking at daddy.
          
          Jackson spots the little Cessna in the distance.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY ARMY BASE/YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK - DAY
          
          At the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms,
          cutting the RV off from reaching the plane.
          
          Lilly sticks out her head.
          
                                       LILLY
                    Mommy!
          
          Jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending Lilly
          flying out. Without thinking, he lets go of the wheel,
          lunging after her and pulling her back inside.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Stay down darling.
          
          Jackson races the RV alongside the forming crack.
          
          Spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision.
          Slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full
          speed.
          
          Moments later the RV is airborne!
          
          Kate watches, too shocked to scream. A few drawn out seconds.
          
          Then the RV touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane.
          
          Kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. Lilly jumps
          out, racing into her mom's arms. Jackson turns and sees the
          cloud approaching.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    You guys go! I'll be right there!
          
          Kate pulls Lilly back to the plane.
          
          Jackson jumps into the back of the RV scavenging through the
          shelves, looking for Charlie's map.
          
          Kate lifts Lilly onto the wing of the plane. Gordon revs up
          the engines.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Give me your hand, Lil'.
          
          Noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit.

          Fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and
          left of their plane as Kate climbs in.
          
                                     GORDON
                    We have to take off!
          
                                      NOAH
                    No!
          
                                      LILLY
                    Where's daddy?!
          
                                     GORDON
                    Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll
                    all die!
          
          Gordon pushes the throttle. The plane starts to move. Kate
          screams.
          
                                      KATE
                    Gordon! Wait!
          
          Back in the RV, Jackson is frantically going through the
          masses of books and papers on the shelves. Finally, a map. He
          unfolds it. But it's only of the London underground system.
          
          He throws it to the ground and finds another. This time he's
          lucky! There are markings everywhere.
          
          As he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the RV.
          Kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight.
          
                                      KATE (CONT'D)
                    JACKSON! NO!
          
          Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom. Gordon just
          stares, paralyzed.
          
          The ASH CLOUD is almost upon them!
          
          Gordon takes action and accelerates the plane.
          
          Kate turns back. A hand emerges from the crevasse. Then
          another, holding a map. Her face lights up.
          
                                      LILLY
                    It's daddy!
          
          Jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in
          his hand.
          
                                      KATE
                    Jackson! Here!
          
          Kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him.

                                     NOAH
                    Faster Dad. You can make it!
          
                                     GORDON
                    Kate, grab him for god sake. We're
                    almost out of runway.
          
          Using every last ounce of energy, Jackson leaps onto the wing
          and is yanked into the plane by Kate.
          
          Just at that moment, the plane lifts off.
          
          Jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath.
          Lilly crawls over and hugs him.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Thanks for waiting guys.
          
          Now all eyes are glued to the speedometer. 180... 190...
          
          The violent ASH CLOUD is hitting their tail rudder. The plane
          swerves wildly! Gordon gets it back under control.
          
          The speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the CLOUD
          slowly falls back. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
          
                                     KATE
                    So, now that you got your map, where
                    are we going?
          
          Jackson unfolds it and takes a look. Hundreds of markings
          clutter the map. In the left corner he discovers a large
          letter C followed by H - I - N - A.
          
          He looks up.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We're gonna need a bigger plane.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The White House is being evacuated. Amidst the chaos stands
          Anheuser. Adrian puts down a phone and looks at him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone
                    erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach
                    Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6.
                    We have strong easterly winds...
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    And the crustal displacement?
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                     ADRIAN
                    No one knows, sir.
          
          Anheuser starts walking, Adrian trails behind.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Let's get the government airborne
                    and... I mean now.
          
          
          INT. OVAL OFFICE/WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Anheuser and Adrian burst into the Anteroom of the Oval
          Office. The President's secretary, SALLY, 55, is packing.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Where is the President, Sally?
          
          Sally looks up stone faced.
          
                                     SALLY
                    He said he wanted to spend a few
                    minutes alone. I think he's over at the
                    chapel.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    The whole North American continent is
                    about to perish, and Wilson decides to
                    go to church!
          
          Adrian shoots an angry look at Anheuser.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    He's praying sir. Which considering the
                    circumstances is not a bad idea.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Maybe. But right now I need the leader
                    of the free world off his knees and on
                    Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours.
                    Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
          
          Anheuser walks away. Adrian and Sally exchange a look.
          
                                     SALLY
                    I really don't like that man.
          
          
          INT. CHAPEL/WHITE HOUSE - SUNSET
          
          Adrian finds the President standing near the front of the
          chapel.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Mr. President? We need to get you out
                    of Washington immediately.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          President Wilson stays with his head bowed.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Now matter how idealistic you are
                    taking office. You lose your innocence
                    behind that desk.
                            (PAUSE)
                    Laura was right. People have died
                    because of the decisions I made.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    That's not your fault sir.
          
          He turns to face Adrian.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You sound like Anheuser.
          
          This quietly affects Adrian.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Laura's never looked at me like that
                    before. Only once... When I told her,
                    her mother had died. You knew the first
                    lady?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    A little.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You know what she said to me that night
                    we brought her to the hospital?
                            (PAUSE)
                    `Tommy... I think you should do a
                    lottery. Every one should have a chance
                    to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me.
                    That's what we should have done.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    There would have been chaos, sir.
          
          President Wilson looks Adrian in the eyes.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    You know what I believe, Adrian. I
                    believe nature should choose for
                    itself, from itself.
          
          Adrian takes this in.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Don't let her go. You'll regret it if
                    you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a
                    man you are. And I'll do the same...
                    You go now. And watch your back for
                    Anheuser.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          Adrian stares at the President in disbelief.
          
                                    ADRIAN
                    But sir?
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Go. That's an order Helmsley.
          
          A tense moment before Adrian starts to walk away. Just as he
          exits the chapel, Wilson calls after him.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Would you tell my daughter... there's
                    nothing on earth that I cherish more
                    than her.
          
          We hold on President Wilson's face.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. LAS VEGAS - SUNSET
          
          Most of Las Vegas is destroyed. A 200 foot wide canyon now
          divides sin city along its famous strip. The towering casinos
          still teeter along the canyon's rim.
          
          All forms of emergency rescue operations are deployed around
          the city.
          
          In the FOREGROUND, we see Las Vegas International Airport,
          its runway cut dramatically short. Large pieces of tarmac
          continue to break off into the crevasse.
          
          
          EXT. AIRFIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - SUNSET
          
          Gordon maneuvers his plane through the chaos. Airplanes are
          strewn about the runway. Passengers everywhere.
          
                                     GORDON
                    I told you we should have gone to my
                    parents' in the Rockies.
          
                                     KATE
                    Gordon's right. Look at this mess.
          
          Jackson looks around frantically.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You don't understand, it's our only
                    chance.

                                     GORDON
                    This isn't one of your crazy stories
                    now. How the hell are we gonna make it
                    to China?
          
                                     NOAH
                    Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never
                    have made it out of California.
          
          Silence. Noah is right and they know it. They taxi past a
          private jet whose front wheel is stuck in a hole in the
          tarmac.
          
          We hear a dog barking and the CAMERA finds Tamara, with
          Caesar in her arms.
          
                                     YURI (O.S.)
                    Careful with the landing gear!
                            (in Russian)
                    Tamara, get the boys out of the way!
          
          An airport tow truck attempts to pull Yuri's Gulfstream jet
          out. Sasha, the pilot, helps. A safety announcement echoes
          through the whole area.
          
                                     VOICE

                    hazardous ash cloud is headed towards
                    the city of Las Vegas.
          
          Tamara looks scared and secretly reaches for Sasha's hand.
          They share an intimate look, no one else sees.
          
                                     VOICE (CONT'D)
                    We strongly advise every one to move
                    indoors immediately...
          
          The tow truck driver panics and runs inside.
          
          We move in on Yuri. For the first time he looks helpless.
          
          In the background, Jackson and his family join the panicked
          crowd heading towards the terminal building. Firemen and
          rescue workers usher them forward.

          Jackson and his family are swept along.

          Adrian enters. Anheuser immediately senses something is
          amiss.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    The President is not coming. I couldn't
                    convince him to.
          
          Everyone in the room looks up, speechless.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So, the captain doesn't want to leave
                    his sinking ship?
                            (PAUSE)
                    Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned
                    that the Vice President's chopper
                    crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.
          
          Adrian is shocked.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What about the Speaker of the House?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    In this chaos... I have no idea!
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir,
                    I just think -
          
          Anheuser moves in dangerously close.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    I don't care what you think, Helmsley.
          
          Laura quietly enters the Command Center, as Anheuser and
          Adrian stare each other down.
          
          
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Your ass only made it into the White
                    House, because your old man knew the
                    First Lady... and because of all that
                    affirmative action bullshit.
          
          Anheuser takes it even further.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    There was a white kid, much more
                    qualified than you. Just so you know.
          
          Adrian's face is ashen.
          
                                     LAURA (O.S.)
                    Where is my father?
          
          Everyone turns to Laura. Silence.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    He wanted to stay with his people.
          
          Suddenly, the engines of Air Force One turn over. Laura
          panics.
          
                                     LAURA
                    We have to go back!
          
          Adrian tries to hold her close to him. Anheuser sees this
          intimate moment and gives a suspicious, questioning look. A
          second later Laura pushes Adrian away.
          
                                     LAURA (CONT'D)
                    Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the
                    Captain.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    There is a protocol for just this
                    situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid
                    we'll have to follow it to the letter.
          
          Anheuser turns to an officer.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Tell the Captain, to take off
                    immediately.
          
          Laura looks at him incredulously.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          Emergency lights illuminate the densely populated terminal.

                                     RESCUE WORKER
                    People, stay away from the windows!
          
          One of the rescue workers yells, pushing Jackson and his
          family back.
          
          Frustrated, Jackson turns to Kate and Gordon.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We can't get stuck here.
          
          Suddenly a voice...
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                    Dr. Silberman? What are you doing here?
          
          They all turn and stare at Tamara, holding her little dog
          against her plump breasts.
          
          Kate gives Gordon a look.
          
                                     GORDON
                            (EMBARRASSED)
                    She's a patient, honey.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (SARCASTICALLY)
                    Nice work.
          
          But when Jackson discovers Yuri behind her, his tone suddenly
          changes. He gets in Yuri's face.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    You bastard. You knew it all along!
                            (at the twins)
                    You and those spoiled rotten sons of
                    yours...
          
          Sasha comes running in and cuts through this.
          
                                     SASHA
                    I found us a plane, an Antonov. They
                    were just about to take off, but the
                    tower didn't let them.
          
                                     YURI
                    Can you still fly that thing?
          
                                     SASHA
                    Sure... But I need a copilot.
          
          Lilly chimes in.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Gordon is a pilot.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          Before Gordon can protest Jackson picks up Lilly.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    Let's go!
          
          They burst through the emergency exit, setting off an alarm.
          Emergency personnel yell after them.
          
                                     RESCUE WORKER
                    Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come
                    back!
          
          But they keep on running. Sasha now leads the way.
          
          
          EXT. AIR FIELD/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          They race around the corner and come to a halt. Before them,
          a Russian freight plane of enormous size--
          
          The ANTONOV 225, the biggest aircraft in the world.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Wow, that is a big plane.

                            (PROUDLY)
                    It's Russian.
          
          Sasha, who has run ahead turns back and sees:
          
          A MASSIVE GREY WALL OF ASH moving towards the airport.
          
                                       SASHA
                    Guys, follow me!
          
          They all run after him up the stairs.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          Sasha enters the cockpit and puts on the headset while
          readying the plane for takeoff.
          
                                     SASHA
                            (into the mic)
                    You'll find folding seats on each side
                    of the cargo hold...

          They all scramble to get into their seats.

                                     NOAH
                    Wow! Look at those!
          
          They discover the cargo they are carrying--
          
          Sports cars, SUV's, concept cars and luxury models, some of
          them are labeled `Las Vegas Auto Show 2012'.
          
                                     YURI
                    We had VIP tickets for that.
          
          The six engines of the Antonov come roaring to life.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          The plane is starting to move. Gordon sits uncomfortably in
          the copilot's seat.
          
                                     SASHA
                    You check the main bus for the
                    hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.
          
                                    GORDON
                    Uh... What?
          
          Sasha reaches over and does it himself.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Work the radio and keep an eye on the
                    fuel, okay?
          
          Gordon nods and puts on the headset, trying to focus.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          People start SCREAMING, when they discover the menacing WALL
          OF ASH racing towards them.
          
                                     RESCUE WORKER

          EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The nose of the Antonov turns onto the runway. This humongous
          plane suddenly looks small against the wall of ash.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          Gordon is panicking.
          
                                     GORDON
                    We have to get going!

          A deafening THUNDER emanates from the engines.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          Everybody grabs their seat as the vibration of the aircraft
          builds.
          
          
          EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The Antonov steadily gains speed as it rumbles down the
          cracked and uneven runway.
          
          The canyon that has swallowed half the city looms ahead. And
          behind them the volcanic cloud bears down.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          Sasha stares down the gap ahead, determined. Gordon's face is
          as white as a sheet.
          
                                     GORDON
                    We're not gonna make it!

          INT. TERMINAL/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The violent cloud has finally reached the airport. The
          terminals are hit by flying debris.
          
          Seconds later, Yuri's Gulfstream is whipped through the air,
          shattering the huge windows into a thousand pieces.
          
          People are thrown like rag dolls as the jet explodes in a
          massive fireball.

          Kate and Jackson hold their kids tight. Tamara clings to
          little Caesar and Yuri to his twins.
          
                                                                       64.
          
          EXT. RUNWAY/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          The Antonov lumbers heavily towards the inevitable drop off
          on the horizon. The runway is way too short...
          
          And to make matters worse, the ground begins to move again,
          slowly arching the tarmac upwards, creating a crooked ramp at
          the end of it.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DUSK
          
          A drop of sweat trickles down Sasha's forehead as he pulls
          back the wheel.
          
          Gordon holds on for dear life as the huge plane barely lifts

          The Antonov is on a collision course with the crumbling
          casino towers along the other side of the rim.

                    GOVNO! (shit). Help me pull!
          
          Gordon grabs the wheel on his side, helping Sasha pull up the
          beast of a plane.
          
          
          EXT. CANYON RIM/LAS VEGAS - DUSK
          
          Very slowly the plane starts to rise and Sasha's face lights
          up. They barely make it over a casino called `Paris; Las
          Vegas'.
          
          But the plane clips its wheels on a high metal structure
          right behind it, ripping away part of the landing gear.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DUSK
          
          After some struggle, Sasha manages to steady the Antonov.
          Gordon's face is green as he looks back.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Was that the Eiffel Tower?
          
          Sasha looks over and grins. He grabs the microphone.

                    Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way
                    to China.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. YAK LA MONASTERY/TIBET - DAY
          
          An ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock. In
          the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the
          Himalayas.
          
          NENG PANG, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and
          teacher LAMA YAK LA, 65. They have tea beneath a huge bronze
          bell.
          
                                     LAMA YAK LA
                            (in Chinese)
                    Do not believe in anything simply
                    because you have heard it, Neng.
          
                                     NENG
                    But Lin is my brother. He is working
                    inside the big tunnels, where the ships
                    are made.
          
          The Lama remains silent.
          
                                     NENG (CONT'D)
                    What is in your wisdom for us to do,
                    great Lama... if Lin is right, if our
                    world is indeed coming to an end?
          
          Instead of answering, the Lama serves him more tea.
          
          When the cup is full, the Lama doesn't stop pouring. Neng
          watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain
          himself.
          
                                     NENG (CONT'D)
                    It's full, great Lama. It can hold no
                    more!
          
          The Lama stops pouring and looks at Neng.
          
                                     LAMA YAK LA
                    Like this cup, Neng, you are full of
                    your own opinions and speculations. How
                    can I show you wisdom unless you first
                    empty your cup?
          
          Neng bows his head in embarrassment.
          
          The Lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his
          neck. On it hangs a set of rusty car keys.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                     LAMA YAK LA (CONT'D)
                    Be careful with the clutch. It tends to
                    slide.
          
          The Lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them,
          smiling from ear to ear. They bow to each other and Neng runs
          off.
          
          Lama Yak La looks after him as a father would. He gets up and
          strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet.
          
          
          EXT. HOUSING PROJECT/TIBET - DAY
          
          As far as you can see is a series of identical little houses.
          The house in the foreground has a chicken coop in the garden.
          
          Mrs. Pang enters the coop. We last saw her when the village
          was being evacuated. She grabs one of the hens. She places
          its head on a woodblock and picks up a rusty hatchet.
          
          Just about to strike, she hears a strange RATTLING noise.
          
          An old truck comes driving towards the house. Behind the
          wheel sits her son Neng. She puts down the hatchet, yelling.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    Bata! Neng is coming!
          
          The young monk jumps out, quickly bowing.
          
                                     NENG
                    Mother, I got a message from Lin. He
                    wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at
                    the west gate. He says he can get us on
                    one of the ships he is working on.
          
          Mrs. Pang is still holding the chicken by its throat.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    I thought Lin is working on the dam?
          
                                     NENG
                    The dam is a ship, Mother. The
                    government lied to us. There will be a
                    big flood.
          
          The chicken hangs limp in Mrs. Pang's hand.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    Not here in the mountains... Let's eat
                    first.
          
          The hen panics as she puts its head back on the block,
          raising the hatchet again.

                    We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry
                    once. Your father was throwing up the
                    whole way.
          
          The door opens and Mr. Pang appears.
          
                                     MR. PANG
                    Neng, I did not know you were coming
                    for dinner.
          
          At that moment the hatchet drops with a THUD!
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

                                     GORDON
                    Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not
                    a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just
                    took some lessons to overcome my fear
                    of flying.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Why did you give up?
          
                                      GORDON
                    It didn't work.
          
          Gordon points to the declining altimeter.
          
                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                    What about the wheels we lost at take-
                    off?
          
                                     SASHA
                    There's 14 on each side. Some of them
                    must still be there.
          
          With that, Sasha commences the landing procedure.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          The Antonov dives into a thick layer of clouds.
          
                                     SASHA (O.S.)
                    Still nothing from the tower?
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon shakes his head.
          
          The two pilots stare ahead watching as the clouds slowly
          change color, from yellow... to orange.
          
          They stare out the window in disbelief.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          Gordon comes climbing down the metal ladder whispering to
          Jackson and Yuri.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Guys, you really oughta take a look at
                    this.
          
          Jackson and Yuri follow Gordon back into the cockpit. The
          women exchange a worried glance.
          
                                                                       71.
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
          When Jackson and Yuri enter, they don't believe their eyes.
          
                                     YURI
                    What is that?
          
                                     SASHA
                    The State of Hawaii!
          
                                     YURI
                    Not good. That is not good.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          From above we watch as the Antonov flies over an endless
          ocean of fiery red lava. The Islands of Hawaii have turned
          into one big volcano.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - NIGHT
          
                                     JACKSON
                    How much fuel do we have?
          
                                     SASHA
                    Not enough. We'll have to make a water
                    landing somewhere in the South China
                    Sea.
          
                                     GORDON
                    At least we won't need our landing
                    gear.
          
          Yuri wonders.
          
                                     YURI
                    What about it?
          
                                     GORDON
                    We lost it all... in Vegas.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV/OVER HAWAII - NIGHT
          
          The damaged landing gear slowly retracts into the vast belly
          of the Antonov as it veers off to the east.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Adrian knocks quietly and sticks his head around the door.
          Laura is sitting in her father's chair.

                                       ADRIAN
                    Can I come in?
          
                                     LAURA
                    I've got nothing to say to you.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    But I do...
          
          Adrian enters. He has his travel bag in one hand. He looks at
          Laura and gathers himself.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Your Dad and I... we were trying to
                    protect you.
          
                                     LAURA
                            (EXPLODING)
                    I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need
                    protection. You used me. You guys had
                    me gallivanting around the world, as
                    part of your little cover-up.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    But you were doing a good job.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or
                    Picasso. But if you're some young
                    talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're
                    not famous enough. People like you and
                    Anheuser and my father - you think you
                    can play God.
          
          Adrian takes a moment, he's desperate to make her see.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You know what your father believed.
                    That nature will choose itself from
                    itself.
          
                                     LAURA
                    That's bullshit and you know it. It's
                    the fittest, the richest and the
                    strongest that survive.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    That's not true.
          
          Adrian glances down and spots Jackson's book poking out of
          his bag.

                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    What would you say were the chances of
                    a first time, middle-aged writer, who
                    barely sold 500 copies of his novel
                    making it on board this plane?
          
                                     LAURA
                    Zero. What's your point?
          
          Adrian pulls out the book from his bag. He shows her.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and
                    it's a fantastic read. It's part of our
                    legacy now.
          
          Laura takes this in. The plane's intercom cuts through the
          moment.
          
                                     INTERCOM (O.S.)
                    Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your
                    presence immediately.
          
          Adrian takes a breath, but before he leaves -
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What if I tried to sort some of this
                    mess out? I need to know you can
                    forgive me...
          
          Laura looks at him sadly, but with a little hope.
          
                                     LAURA
                    I need to know that too, Adrian.
          
          Adrian moves for the door. He stops.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    One more thing. Your father told me you
                    were the most precious thing to him in
                    the whole world... You are to me too.
          
          As Adrian exits, we hold on Laura's conflicted face.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          The cloud from the Yellowstone eruption has hit Washington
          D.C. hard. Pennsylvania Avenue resembles a war zone. A ten
          inch layer of ash lies on the ground.
          
          The gates of the White House are wide open, with ash-covered
          rescue workers running about, resembling ghosts.
          
                                                                     74.
          
          INT. WEST WING/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The President has turned the whole West Wing into a shelter.
          He walks through the packed rooms assisting where he can.
          
          An old African-American LADY holds a crying young girl.
          President Wilson kneels down to her.
          
                                     OLD LADY
                    She can't find her mother.
          
                                     PRESIDENT
                    Why don't you two girls make yourself
                    comfy on that big couch? I'll see what
                    I can do.
          
          The child nods. The President gets up.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Sally, can you take care of them. I'll
                    go check with the Red Cross...
          
          As he leaves, the old lady looks up at Sally and smiles.
          
                                     OLD LADY
                    No wonder the First Lady fell for him.
                    I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before
                    the President, when she was still
                    singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry
                    Helmsley.
          
                                     SALLY
                    I know, she was amazing.
          
          
          EXT. FRONT LAWN/WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The President walks up to the Red Cross tents placed on the
          front lawn. He stops one of the Red Cross volunteers.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Who can help me with missing persons?
          
          Without looking up, the young guy responds.
          
                                     RED CROSS VOLUNTEER
                    Sorry man, I'm busy right now.
          
          He then recognizes who he's talking to.
          
                                     RED CROSS VOLUNTEER (CONT'D)
                    I mean, of course sir. I didn't
                    realize... What can I do for you, Mr.
                    President?
          
          The President pats him on the shoulder.

                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Don't worry about it. You're doing a
                    great job son...
          
          A deep, low rumble begins, stopping everybody in place.
          
          As it builds, the President grabs onto a tent pole to secure
          himself. He looks out over Washington D.C. His eyes grow
          wide...
          
          The National Mall bends like rubber. The towering Washington
          Monument breaks into pieces.
          
          An even more deafening sound makes him turn--
          
          The Capitol Building rises from behind the trees, lifted up
          by earth's incredible force.
          
          As the whole building breaks apart, the President is thrown
          to the ground.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          All the officers and scientists are glued to monitors that
          show satellite images from all over the globe. Adrian and
          Prof. West stare in disbelief.
          
                                     SCIENCE OFFICER
                    The capitol was hit by a 9.4.
          
          Laura enters the command center unnoticed.

                    House, sir.
          
          She stands there frozen, emotionless. She looks over to
          Anheuser, who is shouting orders. Another officer hands him a

                                     ANHEUSER
                    That's affirmative, Mr. President.
                    Until communication is restored, I am
                    in command.

          Pope Benedict XVI holds mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
          Millions of followers flood Vatican City. It's a sea of
          candles.
          
          Amidst the mass of believers we see the Italian Prime
          Minister Antonioni with his family clinging to him. They all
          are praying.
          
          A low RUMBLE. People look around frightened. In the distance
          we hear SCREAMING.

          A few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under
          Michelangelo's famous fresco. Most prominent above them is
          `The Creation of Adam'.
          
          The cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies.
          A crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through God
          touching the finger of Adam.
          
          Then the whole fresco breaks apart.

          The people in St. Peter's square begin to panic--
          
          The entire Vatican is lifted up in the air. We hold on the
          Prime Minister and his family, as the basilica collapses onto
          the fleeing masses.

          mountain pass. His parents huddle in the back of the pick-up.
          
          The steering wheel is vibrating badly in his hands as he
          slides the clutch and downshifts. As the vehicle slows on the
          steep incline, the vibrations become much worse. Neng worries
          that the truck may be breaking down.
          
          He pulls up and switches off the engine but to his surprise
          the steering wheel continues to vibrate.
          
          Looking out the windshield, he sees the whole earth shaking

                    At least some good news.
          
          Anheuser turns to Adrian.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Would our science advisor care to give
                    us his assessment?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    We expect enormous tsunamis to reach
                    landfall in every continent. The Cho
                    Ming area will be impacted in
                    approximately six hours.
          
          He nods to one of the analysts, who types in a couple of
          commands.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    ... and it looks like the crust has
                    shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south-
                    westerly direction. Here's the computer
                    simulation.

          Everybody stares as the graphic illustrates what happened to
          planet Earth.

                    Our data also shows, that our earth's
                    poles have reversed their magnetic
                    fields...
                            (POINTING)
                    ... These are their new positions.
          
          Anheuser looks at the monitor, then turns to Adrian.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So Helmsley, what you're telling us
                    here is that... the north pole is now
                    somewhere in Wisconsin?
          
          Silence. Adrian clears his throat.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    It's the south pole, sir.
          
          An ALARM SIGNAL goes off--

          A red light blinks on the plane's instrument panel.
          
                                       YURI (O.S.)
                    What's that?
          
                                     SASHA
                    Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are
                    down. We must get ready.
          
          Yuri and Jackson are standing behind the pilots.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Let's go wake up the kids.
          
          Yuri nods and they make their way back to the lower deck.
          
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          Jackson's family are all asleep in their seats, Lilly in her
          mom's lap. She looks like a little angel. Jackson can't bear
          to wake them. He caresses Lilly's face.
          
                                     NOAH (O.S.)
                    Why do you hate Gordon?
          
          Jackson turns to see Noah is awake.

                                     JACKSON
                    What are you talking about? I don't
                    hate Gordon.
          
                                     NOAH
                    But you don't like him either.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I don't know him that well.
          
                                     NOAH
                    But I know him. He's really nice. You
                    should talk to him more often. You guys
                    would get along really well.
          
          This breaks Jackson's heart. He pulls Noah tightly to his
          chest.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise.
          
          Kate opens her eyes.
          
                                    KATE
                    Is it time?
          
          Jackson nods.
          
                                     KATE (CONT'D)
                    Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to
                    land.
          
          On the opposite side of the aircraft, Yuri and Tamara help
          the twins get into their life vests. Noah is suspicious.
          
                                    NOAH
                    What's wrong?
          
          Jackson looks at his kids. They both look scared.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Sasha told us, it could get a little
                    bumpy... and wet.
          
          The Antonov jerks to the side. Two more engines out. Alarm
          signals flash.
          
          
          EXT. ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          The remaining two engines barely hold the plane in the air as
          it dives into the clouds.
          
                                                                     84.
          
          INT. CARGO HOLD/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          Jackson and his family huddle together. He puts his arms
          around Lilly and Noah.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Your daddy has to tell you something.
          
          In the background, Gordon climbs down from the cockpit. He is
          about to speak when he hears Jackson's voice.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    I know that with my writing and work I
                    didn't have a lot of time for you
                    both...
          
          Jackson glances at Kate.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    I wasn't there for you, the way I
                    should have been.
          
          Jackson looks Kate directly in the eyes.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    ... And I am so very sorry for that.
          
          Gordon watches as Kate pulls the kids and Jackson tight. For
          the first time, they seem a little like the family they once
          were.
          
                                     GORDON (O.S.)
                    Jackson, Yuri... I think you guys
                    should come back up here.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT/ANTONOV - DAWN
          
          First Jackson and then Yuri enter the cockpit. Sasha points
          out of the window.
          
                                     SASHA
                    Don't ask me how that happened.
          
          Behind them Yuri and Jackson stare at the snow covered
          mountains of the Himalayas.
          
                                     SASHA (CONT'D)
                    There's no more ocean, and it looks
                    like we're pretty close to where we
                    wanted to go.
          
                                     GORDON
                    It's as if the whole earth shifted by
                    1500 miles...

                    No shit.

                    It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement'

                    We lost our last two engines.
          
          The plane drops rapidly, nearly scraping the tip of a
          mountain. Sasha and Gordon are doing all they can to keep the
          Antonov in the air.
          
          A vast glacier spreads out in front of them.
          
                                     SASHA (CONT'D)
                    I'll shoot for that glacier. Drain the
                    brake fluids. It's going to get
                    rocky... There, the blue levers!
          
          The plane plummets, loosing altitude fast.
          
                                     SASHA (CONT'D)

                    Tamara! Open the door!
          
          Gordon jumps in. Tamara yells at him in desperation.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Where's Sasha?
          
                                     GORDON
                    He said he'll be fine and we should get
                    out of here before he touches down.
          
          Yuri notices Tamara's distress as she keeps looking back to
          the cockpit. Jackson slams the pedal down trying to gain as
          much speed as possible to soften their landing.
          
                                      LILLY
                    Daaadddy!
          
          The Bentley shoots out the back of the plane. As it hits the
          snow, the air bags deploy cushioning the passengers.
          
          The Antonov hits the ice and catapults the rest of the luxury
          cars out of the back cargo hold. They barrel past the Bentley
          like skittles, narrowly missing it as they fly off in
          opposite directions.
          
          The plane skids across the glacier, clipping its wing and
          causing the aircraft to break apart.
          
          Sasha has no control anymore and watches helplessly as he
          shoots towards the ledge in the Antonov, plunging into the
          deep.
          
          The plane crashes and explodes.
          
                                                                       88.
          
          EXT. GLACIER/TIBET - DAWN
          
          As the snow settles we see that the glacier is scattered with
          luxury cars tomb-stoned in the snow.
          
          The Bentley is half buried. We hear Caesar barking.
          
                                     JACKSON (O.S.)
                    Everybody okay back there?
          
                                      KATE (O.S.)
                    We're all fine.
          
          The door opens and Jackson climbs out, looking around. Just
          above the wind, he hears the SOUND OF HELICOPTER BLADES.
          
          One by one the others appear behind Jackson and stare at a
          surreal sight--
          
          Several Chinese Mil-26 choppers airlift animals over the
          mountain pass.
          
          GIRAFFES, ZEBRAS, EVEN ELEPHANTS hang by huge straps from
          these flying machines.
          
          One of the smaller helicopters veers from the transport fleet
          and lands near the Bentley.
          
          Armed soldiers jump out. Their Commander speaks to them in a
          sharp tone.
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER
                    Welcome to the People's Republic of
                    China.
          
          Jackson nods to them.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Thank you...
                            (to Lilly and Noah)
                    Say thank you, kids.
          
          The others acknowledge the soldiers as well. Hi... Hello...
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER
                    What color are your passes?
          
          Jackson stands dumbfounded. The Commander repeats.
          
                                     CHINESE COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    What color are your boarding passes?
          
          Still no answer. He yells an order. The soldiers point their
          guns at them.
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                    89.
          
                                     YURI (O.S.)
                    I have green card.
          
          Surprised, Jackson turns to Yuri who's holding up three green
          plastic cards.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    For my boys and me.
          
          Tamara can't believe what she's hearing.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    It's a joke... a mistake...
                            (LAUGHING)
                    Right Yuri?
          
          Yuri shrugs. Tamara lunges at him.
          
                                     TAMARA (CONT'D)
                            (in Russian)
                    You disgust me. You pig.
          
          Yuri brushes her off, coldly. And then speaks so they can all
          understand him.
          
                                     YURI
                    You think I did not know about you and
                    Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's
                    soul.
          
          With that Yuri turns to the others.
          
                                     YURI (CONT'D)
                    I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson
                    remember, if someone wants to beat
                    you... he has to kill you first. Come
                    boys!
          
          The twins grab Caesar and climb into the helicopter. The dog
          barks furiously, wanting to stay with Tamara.
          
          The next moment, the helicopter takes off.
          
                                     GORDON
                    What!... Did that just happen!?
          
          They're stranded.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. AIRFIELD IN CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN
          
          Air Force One is in the background as Laura, Anheuser, and
          other members of the crew are rushed towards a group of
          waiting helicopters.

          Adrian is a little way back in the middle of the pack. A
          Chinese Officer with a list shouts over the noise.
          
                                     CHINESE OFFICER
                            (POINTING)
                    Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr.
                    Wilson the same.
          
          Laura and Anheuser reach the chopper. An authoritative Naval
          Officer greets them, and raises his voice.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the
                    skipper of the American boat sir. After
                    you!
          
          Anheuser nods and climbs in the chopper. Captain Michaels
          helps Laura in. Adrian arrives just as the Chopper door
          slides shut and it lifts off.
          
          
          INT. HELICOPTER/CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN
          
          Laura catches Adrian's look of unease before they soar away.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson,
                    for your father...
          
          Laura's look thanks him for this. He turns to Anheuser.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Your party is the last to arrive.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    I've been told of damages?
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We haven't completed the assessment but
                    it looks like we lost Number 4 when the
                    crust shifted.
          
          Captain Michaels looks up and points into the distance.
          
                                    CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    There it is!
          
          
          EXT. CHO MING VALLEY/TIBET - DAWN
          
          The CAMERA follows the choppers revealing--
          
          Nine gigantic oval gates that measure at least 60 stories,
          built into the face of a mountain.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

          In front of every gate there is a line of huge `Y' shaped
          metal support structures, which are the launching towers for
          the ships. They are each at least 800 feet high. It's an
          unparalleled feat of engineering.
          
          
          EXT. CHOPPER/CHO MING VALLEY - DAWN
          
          The lead chopper descends onto a platform in front of one of
          the gates, dwarfed against this majestic setting.
          
          The door slides open and Anheuser jumps out. Laura follows.
          She looks around in awe.
          
          Even the utility entrances that lead into the mountain are
          immense. The Captain guides them into the hollow mountain.
          
          In the BACKGROUND we see an angry Yuri scream and argue with
          military personnel, waving his tickets.
          
                                     YURI
                    What do mean we can't board Number 4? I
                    want to speak to your supervisor.
          
                                     SOLDIER
                    I am the supervisor! Now get in line
                    with all the others while we make
                    arrangements.
          
                                     YURI
                    I want your name!

                             BADGE)
                    Can you read? Now get the hell back
                    with the other green cards, or I'll
                    have you detained.
          
          The twins stand nearby, holding Caesar. They look afraid.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

          Jackson and his group are small specks in a barren landscape.
          They have made it down the glacier and are now walking over a
          scree field.
          
          It is hard going. Jackson carries Lilly.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart.
                    You're doing great.

          Kate holds Noah by the hand. Gordon and Tamara trail behind.
          She's still very upset.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    I should have listened to you, Dr.
                    Silberman. I actually liked the way I
                    looked before that monster talked me
                    into it.
          
                                     GORDON
                    Did you know he asked for a discount...
                    and he paid in installments?
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Cheap bastard.
          
                                     GORDON
                    You're better off without him. What he
                    said about you and Sasha, is it true?
          
          Tamara nods silently.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Now that he's gone I think he was worth
                    a hundred times a man like Yuri.
          
          Suddenly they hear the PUTTERING of an engine.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You guys hear that?
          
          In the distance, an old rusty truck comes bumping down the
          dirt road. Jackson puts down Lilly and chases after it.
          
          
          EXT. DIRT ROAD/NEAR CHO MING - DAWN
          
          Neng and his parents drive past, billowing a huge cloud of
          dust just as Jackson reaches the road.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (out of breath)
                    Hey! Help! Wait for us!
          
          But Neng doesn't hear him over the rattling truck. Jackson,
          pissed, kicks at the rocks on the road.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Shit! Shit!
          
          Just then, Neng's mother, sitting in the back of the truck,
          turns and sees his tantrum. She bangs on the rear window of
          the cabin.
          
          Neng looks in the mirror and hits the brakes. Jackson can't
          believe his luck.

          arks. Laura stops halfway, gazing in awe--
          
          Deep down below, thousands of workers are swarming over the
          ship, readying it for launch.
          
          Laura looks up and sees the contrast, spotting the SHEIK we
          met in the Dorchester Hotel as he boards comfortably with his
          huge family.
          
          Laura points down at the workers.
          
                                     LAURA
                    Captain Michaels? What happens to all
                    those people?
          
          The Captain doesn't know what to say. Anheuser turns.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all
                    that. You just stick to your art. We'll
                    handle the rest.
          
          Laura hates him in that moment.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Captain? Where is the Bridge?
          
          Anheuser and Captain Michaels move away as Laura stands and
          watches the frantic workers who are now boarding the animals
          we saw being airlifted over the mountains.
          
                                     CHINESE STEWARD (O.S.)
                    Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way.
          
          Laura has a look of guilt as she follows the steward.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE
          
          Thousands are on the march up the mountains. Behind them a
          valley stretches into the horizon. Plumes of smoke rise from
          destroyed cities in the distance.

          Amongst the refugees, we discover Satnam, the young
          astrophysicist, holding his little son. The rest of Satnam's
          family trails behind.
          
          Distant WARNING SIRENS pierce the silent march, coming from
          the cities below.
          
          People start to scream and run, but Satnam stands there
          frozen. He fumbles for his satellite phone, then hits a
          number on its speed dial.
          
          
          INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE
          
          Adrian is unpacking. He lays down his copy of `Farewell
          Atlantis' just as his cell phone rings.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Satnam?
                            (CONFUSED)
                    Where are you?
          
                                     SATNAM (O.S.)
                    On the Nampan Plateau...
          
          Adrian's face goes pale.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    What?!
          
                                     SATNAM
                    There's a tidal wave coming from the
                    East! It's huge!
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Satnam, what happened?
          
                                     SATNAM (O.S.)
                    We never got picked up, Adrian, the
                    airlift never came!
          
          Adrian closes his eyes.
          
          
          EXT. NAMPAN MOUNTAINS/EAST COAST OF INDIA - SUNRISE
          
          Satnam swallows hard. He stares out into the valley.
          
                                     SATNAM
                    I have to go!
          
          A wall of undulating foam and debris comes rolling towards
          him. A tidal wave of gigantic height.
          
          Everybody panics and scratches for a higher elevation. But
          for Satnam it is clear, they do not stand a chance.

          He picks up his little son, squeezing him tightly to his
          chest, humming an Indian lullaby for the scared child.
          
          
          INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE
          
          Adrian hears SCREAMING on the phone and the deafening sound
          of the approaching wave. He tenses up, desperate but unable
          to do anything.
          
          As the noise reaches its height, the line goes dead. Adrian
          is left breathless.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - SUNRISE
          
          Adrian storms onto the bridge. Many officers and analysts are
          at work under Captain Michaels.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Do we have the latest satellite images
                    of Napam, India?
          
                                       SCIENCE OFFICER
                    One moment, sir.
          
          Anheuser and Prof. West step over and join him.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Helmsley, what's going on here?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Looks like our model was wrong.
          
          They all stare at the monitor showing several tidal waves
          coming in from the south.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Satnam was talking about a wave from
                    the East.
          
          A science officer selects a different quadrant on the
          satellite display. They all stare at the new tidal wave
          that's coming from the East of the Cho Ming valley.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    Jesus!
          
          Anheuser is shocked.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    What does this mean?

                                     ADRIAN
                    The flooding will happen earlier.
                    Bobby, can you plug in the new data
                    please?
          
          As the officer does this, Prof. West looks at Adrian with
          questioning eyes.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Satnam didn't get picked up.
          
          Prof. West is horrified.
          
                                     SCIENCE OFFICER (O.S.)
                    Ready sir.
          
          Adrian turns back to the monitor and sees the new tidal wave
          that is coming towards the Cho Ming valley.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    This one is at least 1500    meters high!
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Talk to me Helmsley. What does this
                    mean for us?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust
                    the count down?
          
          Every one on the bridge stares at a display. It reads--
          
          02hrs - 09min - 07sec
          
          The science officer nervously hits a few keys and the display
          changes to--
          
          00hrs - 28min - 10sec... and counting.
          
          We see the shock on Anheuser's face.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Get me the other Heads of State.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Neng's truck, loaded with Jackson and the others, creeps up
          to the service entrance of the launch site.
          
          A lone figure awaits them. This is Neng's older brother Lin,
          who we saw signing up for the 'Chinese Dam Project'.
          
          Lin notices the strangers in the pick-up truck.

                    Who are they?
          
          Neng answers hesitantly.
          
                                     NENG
                    We found them by the side of the road,
                    my brother.
          
                                     LIN
                    You must send them back.
          
                                     NENG
                    I am a follower of the great Lama Yak
                    La. You know I cannot do that.
          
          The others watch the interaction but do not understand.
          Jackson senses a problem. He grabs Lilly and Noah.
          
                                       JACKSON
                    Come with daddy.
          
          Gordon and Tamara stare perplexed as Jackson approaches Lin
          with his kids.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    At least take our children with you.
                    Please.
          
          Lin answers in broken English.
          
                                     LIN
                    Why should I do that?
          
                                     JACKSON
                    For the same reason you sent for your
                    parents.
          
          Lin stares at him stone faced. In desperation, Kate turns to
          Mrs. Pang.
          
                                     KATE
                    I have no clue if you understand what
                    I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother,
                    please take my kids with you!
          
          Silence. A beat. The old Chinese lady turns to Lin.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)

                                     LIN

                    mother.

          She looks up at her son, determined.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                    We will take them all. Bata?
          
          Mr. Pang nods and reluctantly, Lin motions to Jackson to
          follow. Kate bows to Mrs. Pang.
          
                                     KATE
                    Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.
          
          Jackson and the others acknowledge what Kate has done.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING
          
          We finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship
          yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains.
          
          Nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other.
          Their size is at least four times that of the `Freedom of the
          Seas'. However, they look more like spaceships than anything,
          having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force
          of nature.
          
          But only three of these monstrous ARKS are complete. Number 4
          is being repaired, all the others are still under
          construction, surrounded by scaffolding.
          
          Suddenly SIRENS goes off!
          
          The boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to
          retract. There's growing confusion among the thousands of
          workers and security personnel.
          
          
          INT. PLATFORM, SHIP BAY/CHO MING - EARLY MORNING
          
          Opposite the boarding bridges, on a large platform, Yuri and
          his boys sit in line with the other waiting passengers.
          
          They watch as massive stern gates begin to close. Yuri jumps
          up and yells to the others.
          
                                     YURI
                    They're leaving without us!
          
          The soldier from earlier points his gun at him.

                    Look! Idiot! They are leaving you
                    behind too!
          
          The soldier turns to the ships and Yuri knocks him out. He
          grabs his boys and runs towards the closing gates. All the
          other passengers surge forward with him.
          
          In the distance, on the bow side of the ships, the huge
          mountain gates of the bay open, revealing a stunning view of
          Cho Ming Valley.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          Lin leads his group over a ridge. In front of their eyes--
          
          The gates to the mountain open!
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    We have to hurry!
                            (to Jackson)
                    They launch! We run out of time!
          
          They follow Lin rushing down the hill, towards one of the
          many Y-shaped launch structures towering in front of the
          gates. Neng and Kate help Mr. and Mrs. Pang down the rocky
          terrain.
          
          
          INT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          A screeching and thundering noise!
          
          THE THREE COMPLETED VESSELS BEGIN TO INCH FORWARD on metal
          girders connecting the Y-shaped launch towers.
          
          
          INT. LIVING QUARTERS/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING
          
          Laura feels a jolt. She rushes out of her small cabin and
          into a swarm of people moving down a crammed endless
          corridor. She struggles to fight her way through.
          
          A digital voice blares over the speakers.
          
                                     COMPUTER VOICE

          Laura bumps into one of Adrian's Science Officers.
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     LAURA
                    Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?
          
                                     SCIENCE OFFICER
                    He's in the Technical Command Centre.

          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - MORNING
          
          The three gigantic vessels emerge from the mountain, into the
          open. Support helicopters swarm around them like flies.
          
          
          EXT. BENEATH A LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO-MING - MORNING
          
          Lin and his group look like ants as they scale the metal
          ladders of one of the launch towers.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING
          
          Verbal commands fly back and forth. Anheuser watches the
          preparations from a large window.
          
          He looks over to the command bridges of the other vessels as
          they continue to be pulled into place.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGES/OTHER SHIPS - MORNING
          
          We cut to the various Heads of State, all at their command
          posts.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          A hatch opens at the top of the launch tower. Lin is the
          first to climb out.
          
          Right before his eyes, the hull of the American Ship slowly
          creeps towards him. He's but a speck against this man-made
          behemoth.
          
          Lin hastily pulls the others up.
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give
                    me your hand.
          
          It's a race against time. The huge ship's hull closes in
          fast. Lin and his family crawl up the side arm while Jackson
          hurries to pull up the rest of the group.
          
          Lilly freezes at the sight of the approaching ship.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                    JACKSON
                    Move Lil'bee!
          
          Jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. In a
          frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are
          already huddled on a small platform.
          
          As the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from
          their faces, Mr. Pang loses his balance. Jackson and Lin both
          see this, but Jackson is closer--
          
          He grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to
          his death.
          
          For the first time, Lin acknowledges Jackson with a nod.
          
          
          EXT. SHIP BAY/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The three completed ships are half way out, grinding to their
          final launching position.
          
          A mob of passengers led by Yuri has fought their way to the
          ship. More and more people join them, including soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          Lin, Jackson and the group are huddled on the platform.
          
          The sound of SCREAMING PEOPLE makes them turn. The storming
          masses have arrived at the access platform. There is now a
          huge drop off between them and the tails of the ships.
          
                                     TAMARA
                            (POINTING)
                    Oh my god, that's Yuri!
          
          Next to Yuri are his twins, holding Caesar. She yells!
          
                                    TAMARA (CONT'D)
                    Caesar!
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The little dog hears Tamara and jumps out of Oleg's arms,
          leaping onto one of the thick cables, that connects the
          platform with the launching towers.
          
          Alec and Oleg attempt to run after Caesar, but Yuri grabs
          them by their necks.
          
                                     YURI
                    Let that stupid dog go!
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

          He's panicked. The arriving masses are pushing them to the
          drop off at the edge of the platform.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING - MORNING
          
          The ship has reached its targeted position. A small hatch
          lines up directly in front of Lin and his group.
          
                                     LIN
                            (in Chinese)
                    Okay. Now!
          
          One by one they all climb into the hatch. Jackson being the
          last in, notices that Tamara has stayed back.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Tamara! Come on! Get in!
          
          She doesn't move, anxiously waiting for her beloved dog
          darting towards her.
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The mob pushes at Yuri and his boys. Passengers on either
          side tumble off the platform.
          
          Yuri watches one of them fall, hitting his head against a
          tiny ledge 8 feet below. To his right, he sees a small ladder
          leading down.
          
                                     YURI
                            (in Russian)
                    Down there! Oleg, you go first!
          
          As they hurry down the ladder, people keep tumbling into the
          deep. Reaching the ledge, Oleg discovers Caesar running
          towards Tamara.
          
                                     OLEG
                    Daddy look, Tamara!
          
          Yuri cannot believe his eyes.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF LAUNCHING TOWER/CHO MING SITE - MORNING
          
          The hatch behind Tamara begins to move. The hydraulic
          supports are being lifted, sealing up the vessel.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Caesar darling!
          
          Jackson reaches out from the closing hatch.
          
                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                      JACKSON
                    Tamara! Get in!
          
          Tamara climbs inside the hatch and turns.
          
                                      TAMARA
                    Come to mommy!
          
          Caesar leaps into her arms only seconds before the hatch
          seals. As a last gesture, Tamara sticks out her arm and gives
          Yuri the finger.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - MORNING
          
          Lin leads the group into a long and narrow chamber where the
          hydraulics for the tail gate are located.
          
          He opens a tool cabinet, retrieving a giant electrical power
          drill, almost too big to be carried by one person.
          
          Lin climbs to a hatch near the ceiling and begins to unscrew
          the huge bolts. He looks at Jackson.
          
                                     LIN
                    I need your help.

          Laura and the Science Officer enter the Technical Command
          Center. She finds Adrian staring at a wall of monitors
          showing the horrifying scenario on the platforms.
          
          People are falling to their deaths in large numbers in their
          desperation to board the ship.
          
                                     LAURA
                    What in god's name is happening Adrian?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Anheuser convinced them all to launch.
          
          Outside, panicking workers, screaming for their life!
          Deserted passengers waving their green cards!
          
          Adrian makes a decision and rushes out.

          Anheuser turns hearing Adrian storming onto the bridge.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.

          With that, Adrian turns to the Communication Officer.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    Bobby, make sure the other bridges can
                    hear this.
          
          The officer hesitates as Laura enters in the background.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    What do you think you're doing?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I know exactly what I'm doing.

          Next to her stand the British and French Prime Ministers.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    I know we've all been involved in
                    making difficult decisions... to save
                    our human civilization...

          Anheuser looks on stoney faced.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    ... But to be human means to care for
                    each other, and civilization means to
                    work together to create a better life.
                    If that's true there is nothing human
                    and nothing civilized about what we're
                    doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we
                    really stand by and let all those
                    people out there die?
          
          Laura watches him proudly.

          The Communications Officer looks at Adrian.
          
                                      ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                     That's an order soldier.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                     Don't do it!
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The Russian President, together with the heads of state from
          China and Japan, listen in as Adrian responds.
          
                                      ADRIAN (O.S.)
                     We have to open our gates and let these
                     people in. All of them.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Anheuser has had enough.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                     Have you lost your mind? Look at the
                     countdown. We have less than five
                     minutes left... And none of our ships
                     have the resources to feed those
                     people. If you save them today we all
                     starve tomorrow.
          
          He's almost screaming now.
          
                                      ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                     Do you wanna be responsible for the
                     extinction of the human race? Can you
                     handle that, Adrian?!
          
          Silence.
          
          Adrian's battle seems lost. But he doesn't give up, and
          instead speaks softly now.
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                106.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    There is a young astrophysicist from
                    India who is the reason we are all
                    here, trying to give mankind a second
                    chance. He's the one who discovered it
                    all, the one who connected the dots. We
                    all owe him our lives.
          
          All eyes are glued to Adrian.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I just learned that he was killed with
                    his family by a tsunami in eastern
                    India. You know why?
          
          Adrian stares Anheuser in the eyes as he continues.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    He died because we forgot to pick him
                    up.
                            (PAUSE)
                    I beg you... whatever our future holds
                    don't let us start it with an act of
                    cruelty. What will you tell your
                    children... and their children?
          
          Silence. Laura steps up alongside Adrian.
          
                                     LAURA
                    If my father were here, he would open
                    the gates.
          
          Adrian and Laura share a look.
          
                                     RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                    The people of Russia along with...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/ASIAN SHIP - DAY
          
          His Asian colleagues nod in approval.
          
                                     RUSSIAN PRESIDENT
                    ... China and Japan agree to open the

          INT. BRIDGE/EUROPEAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The German Chancellor speaks up.
          
                                     GERMAN CHANCELLOR
                    The United Kingdom, Spain, France and
                    Germany, and I believe I can also speak
                    for the Italian Prime Minister...
          
                                                                    107.

                    ... We vote to open the gates.
          
          Laura and Adrian watch Anheuser shaking his head in defeat.
          Bobby, the Communications Officer smiles with relief. Adrian
          turns to the Captain.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Captain Michaels, you heard them.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY
          
          One by one the gigantic gates at the stern of the three ships
          begin to creek open.
          
          The masses gathered on the platform CHEER wildly!
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Lilly crawls through the CONNECTING TUNNEL meeting up with
          Kate in a large bay on the other side.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Phew... It stinks in here.
          
          Together with Neng and his parents, they all look up in
          DISBELIEF--
          
          A Giraffe, chewing her cud, smiles down at them. Caesar barks
          at her.
          
                                     TAMARA
                    Sssh...Caesar.
          
          A second later, hundreds of different ANIMALS RESPOND. They
          are in the zoological bay.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Gordon helps Noah up the small ladder leading to the
          connecting tunnel.
          
          Just as he goes to hand him Jackson's backpack, the HYDRAULIC
          MOTORS begin to GROWL! Lin looks up in panic. He screams.
          
                                     LIN
                    They're opening the gate! It will crush
                    us!
          
          The whole ceiling begins to lower towards them. From down
          below, Jackson sees his son about to be hit by it.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                       JACKSON
                    Noah! Watch out!
          
          Gordon makes a split second decision. With all his strength,
          he shoves the boy into the tunnel.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          From the other side of the tunnel, Kate watches as the metal
          ceiling misses Noah by a hair, but catches Gordon, wiping him
          off the ladder.
          
                                       KATE
                    No!
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson watches helplessly as Gordon falls past him. He
          survives his landing and desperately tries to grab on to the
          sloping surface, but he can't. He slips.
          
          Gordon is crushed between the gears, sharing his last look
          with Jackson before he dies.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Kate helps a trembling Noah out of the tunnel.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Something happened, mom.
          
          Kate pulls him close and shuts her eyes tightly. She fights
          back the tears.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson and Lin know they're running out of time, their
          remaining space is shrinking every second.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    We have to stop it!
          
          Lin grabs the huge electrical power drill nearby and attempts
          to jam it between the hydraulic arm and the wall.
          
          As it digs deeper into the metal, the hydraulic starts to
          slow down.
          
                                                                      109.
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING - DAY
          
          Still on the ledge, Yuri and the boys watch as the huge
          boarding gate lowers towards them. They are trapped.
          
          Just then, the gates begin to slow, but surely they will be
          crushed.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Back in the chamber, Lin still struggles with the drill.
          Suddenly he slips.
          
          Jackson manages to catch his fall. But in the process Lin's
          foot gets caught between the gears, mangling it.
          
          He screams in pain as the hydraulic slowly grinds towards a
          halt.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You did it, man. You did it.
          
          In great pain, Lin grins back at him.
          
          
          EXT. LAUNCH SITE/CHO MING VALLEY - DAY
          
          The gates of the ships hit the access platform with a
          thundering noise. People begin to rush on board.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Alarm signals go off. The Captain turns to one of his
          officers.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    What's wrong with the gate?
          
                                     OFFICER
                    I don't know. Maybe there's something
                    jamming it, sir.
          
          The countdown on the monitor reads 2 min. 40 sec. Laura and
          Adrian share a worried look.
          
          We hear a HOLLOW BELL ring!
          
                                                                  CUT TO:

          The booming sound echoes through the Cho Ming valley. As a
          gentle wind catches the Lama's clothes, he looks up--
          
          A tidal wave of immeasurable proportion crests the mountains.
          
          The Lama continues to strike the bell as the monastery is
          wiped clean from the earth.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:

                    Can you zoom in?
          
          The video camera moves in on Kate, Noah and Lilly. Adrian
          can't believe his eyes. He turns to Laura.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I know those kids. Remember the book I
                    told you about? Their father wrote it.
          
          Captain Michaels shouts across the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We're loaded. We can close the gates

          Anheuser looks nervously at the countdown. It reads 1:34
          
          
          EXT. ACCESS PLATFORM/CHO MING SITE - DAY
          
          Above Yuri and the boys, people are leaping from the access
          platform onto the stern gate of the American ship.
          
          Yuri looks for a hole in the flow of people before seizing
          his chance and lifting the first of his boys up.
          
                                     YURI
                            (in Russian)
                    Pull yourself up!
          
          Oleg manages to reach up and hold onto the gate.

          Inside the ship, officers yell.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER (O.S.)
                    To the lower decks people!
          
          The gates suddenly screech back into life and begin to close.
          Yuri doubles his efforts lifting Alec higher, but Alec cannot
          quite reach.
          
          Yuri strains with all his effort before deciding.
          
                                     YURI
                    Oleg! Catch your brother!
          
          Yuri leaps forward holding Alec out in his arms.
          
          Oleg manages to grab his brother's hands as Yuri lets go and
          falls into the deep crevasse below. He makes no noise until
          he hits the rocks beneath.
          
          Oleg pulls his brother from above.

                                     DECK OFFICER
                    Boys, you gotta move.
          
                                     ALEC
                    We wait for our father! He's still down
                    there!
          
          The loading officer attempts to comfort them.
          
                                     DECK OFFICER
                    There's no one down there.
                            (GENTLE)
                    Come on boys, come...
          
          The Officer and the boys look back as the stern gate slowly
          closes. But with a SCREECHING sound it grinds to a halt.
          
          The gate is jammed open leaving a twenty foot gap.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          ALARMS sound. Anheuser and the Captain stare at the monitors.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Why is the stern gate not closing?
          
          
                                                               (CONTINUED)

                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Something's wrong with the hydraulics,
                    sir.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    Captain, over here.
          
          They race over. Adrian points to a monitor.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    I think we found the problem.
          
          On the monitor, they see Sarah and the others desperately
          waiting for Jackson and Lin.
          
                                     ADRIAN (CONT'D)
                    How did they get in there?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    They must have come through the
                    hydraulic chamber. There...
          
          Bobby, the Surveillance Officer, selects a different camera
          and we now see inside the tunnel in which Jackson is pulling
          along a wounded Lin.
          
                                     LAURA
                    That guy is injured. Something must
                    have gone wrong.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    You're damn right something went wrong!
                    Congratulations Helmsley, you may have
                    just killed us all but as long as your
                    conscience is clean...
          
          Adrian tries to ignore this.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Let's get an emergency crew there right
                    now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic
                    Chamber.
          
          Anheuser sneers him, shooting a look to Laura.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    You think you're the main man now, just
                    because your fucking the President's
                    daughter?
          
          Without thinking, Adrian turns and punches Anheuser hard in
          the face. He drops to the floor, out cold.
          
          Everyone stands in stunned silence. Laura smiles. Adrian
          looks around.
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                     ADRIAN
                    What are you all waiting for?
          
          They speed off. The countdown reads 0 min. 53 sec.

          Further down in the valley, the tidal wave has reached the
          Cho Ming airfield, blasting away the planes with overwhelming
          force.

          The massive propellers of the ships begin to turn. However,
          the props of the American ship don't move.
          
          In the background, the huge tidal wave comes thundering
          towards them.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          An IMPACT WARNING sounds as Adrian and Laura race through the
          crammed hallways with members of the rescue crew. One of the
          officers explains.
          
                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                    If we can't close the stern gate, then
                    the engines won't start.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    There's no way to override it?
          
                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                    No sir, it has to be done manually.

          Kate, Noah and Lilly watch as Jackson nears the end of the
          tunnel with Lin. Neng comforts his brother who's about to
          pass out.
          
                                     NENG

          THE WAVE FINALLY HITS!
          
          All three vessels are now engulfed in churning water.
          
          They rock back and forth. Only the huge support towers
          they're resting on, keep them anchored.
          
          
          INT. INSIDE LOADING GATE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          A new ALARM sounds as water begins to shoot through the open
          stern gate of the American ship.
          
          The people on the loading bay panic, among them we see Alec
          and Oleg.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The same ALARM rings out in the hallways of the ship. Laura,
          Adrian and their party are all braced against the corridor,
          as the vessel undulates back and forth.
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    Water has penetrated the stern!
          
          Laura looks unsure.
          
                                     LAURA
                    What now?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    The rear of the ship will start sealing
                    itself up one compartment at a time.
          
          Adrian looks at him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Then how will we get to the hydraulic
                    chamber?
          
                                     SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                    If we don't hurry, we won't be able to.
          
          Despite the violent movement of the ship, Adrian pushes on
          down the corridor towards the back of the boat. They follow.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Water is also now rushing into the Zoological Bay and only
          the giraffe can manage to keep her head dry.
          
          Jackson is not yet out of the tunnel with an unconscious Lin.

          Kate shouts across to Tamara.
          
                                     KATE
                    Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.
          
          Kate reaches in to help Jackson as Tamara begins to move with
          Lilly. Noah remains back with his mother.
          
          Jackson finally makes it through with Lin. Kate is almost
          tearful with relief to see him.
          
                                     KATE (CONT'D)
                    I was so worried about you.
          
          Suddenly the Zoological bay begins to seal itself off.
          
          Lilly, already in the next compartment with Tamara and her
          dog, screams out as a chamber door quickly slides up, from
          the floor to the ceiling. It separates Lilly from her family.
          
                                       LILLY
                    Mummy!
          
          Jackson and Kate turn but it's too late. They only catch a
          glimpse of Lilly before they are sealed in. The water level
          continues to rise.
          
          
          INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Panicked, Tamara turns and looks around. Down the corridor,
          in the distance, she sees Adrian, Laura and the rescue crew
          approaching.
          
          But between them she spots the next chamber door rising
          quickly.
          
                                       TAMARA
                    Lilly run!
          
          Lilly starts moving as Tamara turns and picks up Caesar.
          
          Moving quickly, Lilly is able to climb up and over the fast
          rising door. But as she dangles from the other side, she
          looks down and is too scared to jump.
          
                                       TAMARA (O.S) (CONT'D)
                    Lilly! Take him.
          
          Lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold Caesar
          above the quickly narrowing gap.
          
          In a courageous move, Lilly grabs the little dog before he
          gets crushed and together they fall to the ground.

          Back on the other side of the chamber door, Tamara looks
          around. She is trapped now as the water continues to rush in.

          Laura picks Lilly up and comforts her. Adrian realizes they
          are too late. He turns to the rescue crew.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Is there any way to talk to them?
          
          Lilly is close to tears.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The water continues to flood in as Jackson helps Neng with
          his unconscious brother.
          
                                     JACKSON

          Suddenly, a VIOLENT SHAKE throws them all off balance,
          pitching them into the water.

          In the debris-filled, murky waters we see that the fuselage
          of Air Force One has slammed against the first of the ship's
          launch towers.
          
          Slowly it begins to bend, finally giving way. The other
          launch towers follow like dominos.
          
          The ship is ripped from its anchorage and sent drifting
          sideways, rudderless.

          The giant ship drifts upside down and rudderless - smashed
          around by the debris and raging waters.
          
          But then, as it hits another ridge, it rolls right side up
          and seems to steady itself.
          
          However, the strong currents continue to force it through the
          mountain ranges of the Himalayas.

          for the first time.
          
                                     KATE
                    We need something to stop the bleeding
                    or he'll die.
          
          A split second later Noah holds out his belt.

                    Mum, will this do?
          
          Suddenly Jackson hears a voice over a speaker.

                    Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We
                    met once before. Your daughter is with
                    me.
          
          Kate screams with relief.

          INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY
          
          Adrian is using an emergency wall intercom, with Laura next
          to him, holding Lilly.
          
                                       LILLY
                    I'm alright Mom!
          
          Caesar barks.

          Tamara hears Caesar over the speaker in her compartment and
          smiles with relief. She is struggling to stay afloat though,
          and is running out of air.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson discovers the wall speaker. He moves closer to it.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    We can't get to you. Whatever you did,
                    jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get
                    it out... None of us will make it.

          All eyes are on Adrian as he speaks.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You're our only hope.
          
          Adrian looks at Laura.

                                     JACKSON
                    I'll go back. I'll try my best.
          
                                     NOAH
                    I'll go with you.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    You stay with Mommy.
          
          Jackson looks at Kate.
          
          
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                    I'll be right back...
          
          The water is up to their chest now. Jackson takes a breath
          and disappears underwater.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Back on the bridge, Anheuser regains consciousness and gets
          to his feet. His nose is bleeding. He looks around him.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Captain, what's happening?
          
          The Captain looks at him annoyed.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    What's happening?...
                            (PAUSES)
                    We're heading straight for the north
                    face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.
          
          Anheuser looks at him dumbfounded as he stumbles to the
          window and sees the massive rock face of Mount Everest in the
          distance.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson swims down into the dark chamber and reaches the
          jammed power tool, pulling at it. But it doesn't budge.
          
          
          INT. ANTE-CHAMBER ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The water level in Tamara's compartment is at its height now
          and she goes under.
          
          She struggles below the surface for a moment, looking around
          desperately for a way out but there is none.
          
          Tamara drowns.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson manages to find an air pocket. He fills up his lungs
          with air and thinks hard.
          
          As he strips off his jacket, he seems to have a plan. He
          dives under again.
          
                                                                   120.

          Lin is being held up in the water by his brother and parents.
          
          Kate has wrapped the belt around his lower leg and now pulls
          it tight. Lin screams.
          
          Noah uses this as the moment to dive underwater, unnoticed,
          to go and help his father.
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Back under water, Jackson is using the extension cord of the
          power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet.
          
          Jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. He begins to
          use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Anheuser and everybody on the bridge stares as the north face
          of Mount Everest is almost upon them.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Kate and the Pangs are desperately close to running out of
          air now, but despite this, Kate still tends to Lin.
          
          After a moment she turns and is first confused then horrified
          to see that Noah is nowhere to be found.
          
                                       KATE
                    Noah!
          
          
          INT. HYDRAULIC CHAMBER/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift
          the drill.
          
          To his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle
          of the crowbar. Noah is alongside him now, helping.
          
          Working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to
          loosen it before finally the drill comes free.
          
          Adrian gives Noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the
          surface. Jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he
          spots the knapsack containing his laptop.
          
          He dives back down for it.
          
                                                                      121.

          Noah emerges from the water.
          
                                      NOAH
                    Mom, we did it!
          
          Kate pulls him to her, relieved he is safe. Noah smiles and
          calls out towards the nearly submerged speaker.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTING CORRIDOR/ZOOLOGICAL BAY - DAY
          
          Lilly and Laura wait nervously. They hear a muffled voice.
          
                                     NOAH (O.S.)
                    We got it free. Can you hear me? We did
                    it!
          
          Adrian leaps up when he hears this. He flicks a button on the
          intercom.
          
                                     ADRIAN

          Hearing this, the Captain yells the eagerly awaited order.

                    That's affirmative. Close the gate!

          Jackson reaches his knapsack, but when sees Noah's cell phone
          lying next to it, he makes a decision and reaches for that
          instead.
          
          He hears the muffled sound of the engines and smiles. But as
          he turns to swim back, his face freezes--
          
          He's looking into the lifeless eyes of Gordon, who floats
          inches from his face.
          
                                                                     122.

          The gigantic propellers fight against the current, hitting
          rock at the base of the mountain.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          The battle seems hopeless. Captain Michaels yells at the top
          of his lungs.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS

                    number three is out, sir!
          
          The vessel scrapes against the rocks, throwing Anheuser to
          the floor.

          Everyone on the bridge watches in awe as Mount Everest,
          earth's highest peak, drifts slowly past.
          
          After a long beat, they begin to holler and cheer.
          
          
          INT. ZOOLOGICAL BAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Kate hears the CHEERING coming from the speakers. The water
          level stops rising but she still looks around in panic.
          
                                     KATE
                    Noah! Where is he?
          
          Noah begins to cry.
          
                                     NOAH
                    He was just behind me...
          
          Finally! Jackson bursts out of the water and takes a lungfull
          of wonderful air.
          
          Kate and Noah are overjoyed. The Pangs smile to one another.
          
          Jackson looks Kate squarely in the eyes.

                    Actually my diary's pretty open.
          
          The intimate moment is cut short.
          
                                     OFFICER (O.S.)
                            (over loudspeaker)
                    Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian and Laura make their way to the bridge.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)
                    Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain
                    Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I
                    will be giving the orders to unseal the
                    decks.
          
          
          INT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Jackson and his family stand amongst thousands of other
          people who are gathering in anticipation.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (O.S.)
                    Please be careful when you step out and
                    of course... enjoy the fresh air.
          
          Jackson kneels down and zips up Lilly's jacket. She is
          holding Caesar, whose still wearing his diamond collar.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Daddy? When can we go back home?

                                     JACKSON
                    There's nothing we can go back to
                    Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's
                    our home now. Don't be scared.
          
                                     LILLY
                    I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups.
          
                                     JACKSON
                            (PROUDLY)
                    That's my big girl.
          
          Jackson squeezes Lilly's shoulder.
          
                                      OLEG (O.S.)
                    Can we pet him?
          
          Lilly turns to see Yuri's boys standing next to her.
          
                                     LILLY
                    Of course you can. He's your doggie.
          
          The boys both smile at her.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian and Laura enter the bridge.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    You called for me, sir?
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Prof. West has something to show you,
                    Mr. Helmsley.
          
          The Captain directs him to a monitor.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Looks like your scientific projections
                    are way off again.
          
          The Captain grins at Prof. West.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    The water is receding much faster than
                    we projected, Adrian...
          
          A monitor reveals an image of the African continent, however
          its shape changed dramatically. The image of the southern tip
          is enlarged.
          
                                      LAURA
                    What's that?

                                     PROF. WEST
                    It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas
                    are no longer the roof of the world.
                    It's now the Drakensberg mountains of
                    Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African
                    continent has risen several thousand
                    feet and most likely, never even
                    flooded.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    Our European colleagues have already
                    set course for it.
          
          Captain Michaels hands Adrian a short wave radio.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                    Here, somebody wants to talk to you.
          
          Adrian curious, grabs the mic.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    This is Helmsley.
          
          We hear a muffled, raspy voice through the speakers.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY
          
          Harry Helmsley stands beside the cruise ship's Captain.
          
                                     VOICE
                    No, this is Helmsley.
          
                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    Dad!... Is that you?
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian is ecstatic. Captain Michaels explains.
          
                                     CAPTAIN MICHAELS
                    We should have a visual of the `Freedom
                    of the Seas' shortly.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up.
                    How's Tony?
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/FREEDOM OF THE SEAS - DAY
          
          Harry looks over at Tony who's listening, smiling.
          
                                     HARRY HELMSLEY
                    He's fine, son. We're all fine.

                                     ADRIAN (O.S.)
                    See you guys soon. Bye dad.
          
          Harry hangs up. He picks up Tony, embracing him wildly.
          
          
          INT. COMMAND BRIDGE/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          Adrian, still excited from speaking with his dad, grabs Laura
          and kisses her on the lips. She squeals.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    Put that woman down Helmsley.
          
          Adrian looks at Anheuser, unsure of what he might say.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Young guys like you with your
                    idealistic dreams, you think you can
                    change the world...
          
          Adrian and Laura exchange a look.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    I just pray to God, that you keep on
                    making the right calls... in this new
                    world of ours.
          
          Adrian nods and with a smile to Laura turns to leave.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.
          
          Adrian turns back.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (CONT'D)
                    There was no one.
          
                                       ADRIAN
                    Pardon me?
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    There was no white kid better than you.
                    I'm terribly sorry I said that.
          
          Anheuser puts out his hand. Adrian takes it.

                    This is your Captain speaking. Standby
                    to open Deck 1.

                    Standing by Sir.

          Neng pushes his brother Lin in a wheelchair onto the deck
          next to his parents. Mrs. Pang turns to her husband.
          
                                     MRS. PANG
                            (in Chinese)
                    I wonder will the clouds look the same
                    and the stars?
          
                                     MR.PANG
                    Do not fear. Some things will never
                    change.
          
          The old Chinese man forces a little smile. Closer to the
          front of this crowd Jackson approaches Noah.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    I thought you might want this.
          
          He takes Noah's cell phone from his pocket and hands it to
          him.
          
                                     NOAH
                    Do you think I'll still get a signal
                    ... Dad?
          
          Jackson is touched to hear him use that word. He smiles and
          hugs him. Adrian, Laura and Anheuser arrive alongside them.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I finally finished your book Jackson.
          
                                     KATE
                    Really? You may well be the first
                    person who ever got to the end.
          
          Jackson looks at her, smiling playfully.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Excuse me, I believe he's addressing
                    the author. Well, what did you think?
          
          Adrian smiles.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I'd say... those astronauts of yours
                    would be shitting themselves, if they
                    knew all their relatives are now stuck
                    in the South Pole.
          
          Suddenly a horn sounds and the sealed deck doors let off a
          burst of pressurised air. A murmur goes through the crowd.
          
          Everyone is silent as the huge deck doors slowly begin to
          roll back and light streams in.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

          The Pang family try to see over people's heads, even Anheuser
          looks hopeful. Jackson pulls his family close as the first
          rays of daylight hit their faces.
          
          
          EXT. AMERICAN SHIP/SOMEWHERE IN THE HIMALAYAS - DAY
          
          Hatches unseal all around the ship. Sun streams through the
          clouds. Everywhere people emerge outside, into the light of
          day. A majestic moment.
          
          
          EXT. FRONT DECK/AMERICAN SHIP - DAY
          
          They all stare in awe at the waters receding against the ice-
          covered mountain peaks. Caesar lets out a YELP of joy.
          
          Almost as soon as the doors have opened, the ship's
          HELICOPTERS take off, flying towards a stunning site--
          
          The `Freedom of the Seas' is perched on a mountain peak,
          surrounded by calm waters. Behind it, they see the most
          beautiful rainbow. This is the new world.
          
          And again we hear Mozart's Adagio...

          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - DAY

          We see an early incarnation of a MACHINE (this will be the
          inner brain of the FABRICATION MACHINE). We see the
          scientist, in a white coat.
          
           We pull back to see the Scientist is playing a complicated
          MULTI-LEVEL 3-D chess game on a MULTI-LEVEL GAME BOARD with

          then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere.
          
          We pull back further to see the back and legs of the
          DICTATOR, with black-uniformed soldiers flanking him. The
          regime's emblem can be seen on the uniforms.

                       Please.   Give it a chance.
          
          We're on the machine, which is clicking and jerking as it
          malfunctions.
          
                                  DICTATOR (V.O.)
          One more.      That's all.
          We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the
          soldiers accompany him out.
          
          We see the scientist's dejected face as he comes towards the
          camera to turn it off.

          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - NIGHT
          
          The grainy footage rolls again; we see the scientist moving
          away from the camera (having just turned it on).
          
          The lab is shadowy, late at night. We see his worktable for
          the first time, covered with discarded sketches, a furiously
          filled-in journal, and pieces of failed machinery (the floor
          is also similarly littered). The TALISMAN sits on the
          worktable. Nearby is a small old-fashioned tiny little box.
          
                              SCIENTIST
                        (tired, but dictating to
                         keep the documentary
                         record complete)
                    My last possible solution....
                        (muttering to himself)
                    It must work...
          
          He gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though
          for good luck. He picks the TALISMAN up off the table. He
          moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the
          machine.
          
          His back to us, he faces the machine. We see him putting
          something over his face (but only from behind).
          
          There is a sudden FLASH OF GREEN LIGHT and the machine JOLTS,
          and then suddenly, starts up...lighting up, electricity
          crackling, parts moving in smooth coordination, etc.
          
          The scientist waits, watching. The machine continues to run.
          Its arms move smoothly, almost curiously.
          
          The scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets
          up and comes towards camera.
          
          We see the camera's POV as the scientist comes towards us:
          CLOSE on the scientist's face, which is exhausted, cheeks
          sunken, eyes wide, pupils dilated.
          
          Pull back to show the machine purring, suddenly full of a new
          sort of energy. Something new has happened.
          
          The scientist switches off the camera and:
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
          INT. SCIENTIST'S LAB - A DAY LATER
          
          The machine zips through the complex 3-D chess game at
          lightning speed, checkmating the scientist in seconds as the
          Dictator watches.

          The scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine.
          
                                 DICTATOR
                      Perfect.

                      You see, it evolves.
          
          The scientist proudly gives the machine to the dictator. A
          flash goes off: someone is taking a picture O.S.
          
          The dictator exits; we hear the click of boots and see as
          much as possible of the soldiers flanking him.
          
          OUT OF SIGHT OF THE SCIENTIST,
          
          CLOSE on the machine: the dictator is gripping it with a
          nasty firmness. The machine seems to try to squirm away.
          The director's BLACK-GLOVED HAND grasps it harder.
          
           he machine, responding to the brutality, lashes an arm out
          and grabs the nearest soldier (seen from the back, we see
          only the uniform and helmeted head) by the back of his arm,
          BREAKING his ARM. The soldier falls (if possible).
          
           he dictator CONTINUES ON WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE.

          He stops and is strangely drawn to the TALISMAN. He turns

          heads out.

          SEQ. 029 - EXT. WASTELAND - DAY
          
          9 moves warily in the dusty, grim light, along the deserted
          RUINS of the outside streets. It is the remains of war.
          
          Pulverized HULKS of BUILDINGS, torn-open suitcases, scattered
          clothes, rusting cars and the grim debris of human
          civilization surround him.
          
          He sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front
          seat of a car.
          
          Banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on
          them.
          
           achines lie deserted on the sides of roads.
          
          Distracted by the spectacle, 9 stumbles and lands on a ragged
          old flyer: REVOLT!    He looks back at the War Machines and
          Dictator flags.    He sees a vandalized poster of what appears
          to be a dictator/leader.
          
          9 looks around him, trying to piece together what happened.
          Suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him.
          
          9 sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war
          Machine.
          
           LOSE on 9 as the light crosses his face.
          
          Scared, he ducks behind a huge piece of debris.   9 grabs a
          piece of metal lying in front of him.
          
          The shadow moves closer, 9 shakes nervously. The figure
          emerges with spear in hand and 9 swings the weapon at him
          with all his might.
          
          9 hits him square in the chest. It is another ragdoll: 2. 2
          is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris
          behind him. 9 quickly tries to hide.
          
                              2

          But 2 is looking at 9 with surprise.   He struggles to get up,
                               2
          speaking with urgency to 9.
          
          
                        (firmly, kindly, almost
                         eagerly; like trying to
                         soothe a wild animal)
                    Wait... I am a friend.

                    Friend... I am a friend.
          
          9 now sees he has hit a ragdoll, similar to himself. He
          hesitates, not sure what to make of this. 2 extends his
          hand, calmly, eagerly. 9 hesitates again, then, still timid,
          but showing a little bravery, drops his weapon and goes to
          help 2 up.
          
          We see that 2 is much older, much more decrepit, much more
          primitively constructed: he is made from patchwork bits of
          OLD LEATHER SHOES. A SHOELACE stitches up his front and is
          tied in a bow at his neck. Bits of leather FRAY off him.
          His feet are primitive small HINGES. Half of a pair of
          eyeglasses, like an enormous MONOCLE, is attached to 2's hat.
          
          9 helps straighten 2's monocle. 2 smiles at him. We see
          that 2 is like a wise mentor, a kindly professor with a
          contagious eagerness and imaginativeness.
          
          2 peers eagerly at 9.   He circles 9 and spots the number on
          his back.

                    Yes... yes... I always thought
                    there'd be one more.
          
          He nods and smiles. He extends his hand to shake 9's hand.
          While doing this, he takes 9's hand and studies it, nodding
          with eager excitement. We see that 9's hand is more
          sophisticated than 2's.
          
                              2 (CONT'D)

          2 turns slightly, and 9 sees his number and tries to say it.
          But no sound comes out of his mouth.
          
            looks at him, nodding, again, the kind mentor. He's
          interested, observing without judging; curious, kindly and
          ready to help.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      You can't speak.
          
          With a friendly, disarming smile, he taps 9's zipper. 9
          unzips himself and 2 peers in. 2 looks up, happy that he can
          help.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      Yes, yes...
          
          2 looks around nervously and hurries over to his roller-skate
          cart covered with detritus - odds and ends, a broken china
          doll.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      ...come with me.

          2 finds the china doll.
          
                                2 (CONT'D)
                      Here!
          
          As 2 rummages through the chest of the china doll 9 picks up
          a bullet casing from 2's cart and starts tapping it. 2 turns
          with the doll's voice box in his hand.

                      No! Stop!
          
          2 eases the bullet away from 9, then smiles gently at 9,
          EXPLAINING:

                      Some things in this world are
                      better left where they lie.
          
           e puts the bullet to one side and kneels, prying into 9's
          chest. 2 begins to connect the doll's voice box.

                    But if you know where to look,
                    these ruins are full of riches.
          
          2 concentrates, a look of pleasure on his face as he twists a
          few more wires. Static and unclear sound come out at first,
          but as 2 tunes the voice further...
          
                              9
                        (as his voice is "tuned
                         in".. starting with pure
                         static, then slowly
                         moving into a voice)
                    Chhhhhhh.....chhhhehhhh...
          
                              2
                    Wait..
                        (tunes him in)
                    ...almost there...
          
          9 gets a little panicky look on his face at the strange
          sounds coming out of him. 2 puts a calm hand on his
          shoulder. 9 calms down and tries again.
          
                               9
                    Friend?   Friend?

                    No. There are others.
          
            and 2 stare at each other. 9 looks at 2 in wonderment,
          then reaches out and touches 2's chest where he hit it.
          
          2 beams at 9, happy 9 can speak, happy he was able to help,
          and happy that 9, with his first words, is concerned about
          others.
          
            glow beams from within 9's chest.   2 stares.   9 removes the
          TALISMAN from his chest.
          
          2 has a big reaction--he draws his breath in and looks at it
          in ASTONISHMENT.

          2 points forcefully to an old rusted can.
          
          2 runs into the can.
              stands, ready to attack.
          
          9 watches 2, wondering what is coming. Then from behind him,
          a large claw of a mechanical figure settles softly next to
          9's can. He tries to call out to 2...
          
          And from behind 2 enters--
          
          A HIDEOUS CAT BEAST.
          
           t is a nail and razor-studded predatory Machine with a cat
          skull-shaped head, its body laced with bones, nails and
          razors. 9 now understands 2 was trying to protect him.
          
            GASPS as he turns and sees it. The Cat Beast lets out a
          roar and claws at 2, KNOCKING him over and losing his spear.
          
              looks on with horror.

          2 attempts to reach for his spear but the Beast holds him
          down with its razor-sharp feet.
          
          The Beast is attracted to the Talisman. It picks it up with
          one of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically.
          
            cringes.    His movement makes his hiding place teeter,
          creaking.
          
           he Cat Beast WHIRLS at the sound. Picking up 2's struggling
          body, the Cat Beast stalks towards the noise, right up to 9's
          hiding place, sniffing through its hollow nostrils. 9
          cringes in terror. The Cat Beast probes with one of his
          claws INTO the tin can. 9 recoils. The claws do not find
          him and retreat. 9 is relieved.
          
          A beat, then:
          
          9 feels himself violently LIFTED UP and SMASHED.
          
          We see the Cat Beast has picked up the entire tin can and is
          smashing it to get at what's inside it.   Failing, it hurls
          the tin can aside.
          
          9 is almost knocked out. Trying to stay conscious, he
          struggles towards the entrance of the can.
          
           is POV: through his haze and through the broken edges of the
          opening to the can, he sees the Cat Beast GRAB the Talisman
          and the struggling 2 in his sharp-toothed mouth, and

          Another RAGDOLL pushes into the workroom. This is a bigger
          ragdoll, the most primitive one we have seen. He has
          primitive wooden hinges for feet. He is very frayed and
          patched together. The number 1 is painted on his back.
          
              and 9 whirl around.       5 CRINGES.

                      I... I was coming to tell you...
          
          1 carries himself with authority. He wears a red cloak, and
          a strange mother of pearl and wire hat bound together as an
          almost papal-like headpiece, and carries a staff made from an
          old gear, with a bell attached.
          
            pulls at 9 with his staff, displaying the number on his
          back.
          
                                1
                       hat's this?
          
            turns and glares at 5 like a general glaring at a new
          private, expecting an explanation for a misdeed. 5 cringes
          back, obviously intimidated by 1.

          1 HOOKS 5 by the neck with his staff, cutting off his speech.

                    I saw him from the watchtower and I
                    thought...
          
          
                     ou'll lead The Beast straight back
                    to us! How many times have I told

                    The Beast--that's what took 2!   If
                    we hurry we could save him--
          
                               1
                        (CURTLY)
                    If the Beast took him, that's the
                    end of it.
          
                              9
                    But he was still alive--
          
          5 turns with sudden hope to 9.   2 might still be alive?
          
                              1
                    No, we have RULES.
          
          1 smashes his staff against the ground.
          
          Immediately, a knife comes through the curtain revealing
          another RAGDOLL: a large ragdoll, with the number "8" on his
          arm.
          
                                (CONT'D)
                        (TO 8)
                    Our new guest seems confused.
                        (condescendingly, to 9)
                    Perhaps I can help you achieve some
                    clarity.
          
          8 is very large, and designed for great strength. He is
          almost as evolved in his design as 9, but his design favors
          primarily brute force.
          
          He has armored himself with curved pieces of tin and metal.
          He carries the blade of a large kitchen knife, with a nail he
          has attached for a handle. On his back he has slung another
          knife--half of a scissors; the scissors handle loops up above
          his head.

          1 leaves. 8 taps his knife in his hand and motions for 9 and
          5 to follow.  They follow.

          talking also.
          
          The group gets into a bucket-like device.   8 pushes 9 hard
          into the bucket.
          
            NODS commandingly to 8. 8 begins to crank a rope that

          9 looks directly into his eyes. He knows how 5 loved and
          admired his mentor and everything he did. He understands
          that 5 would like to be like 2, to do what 2 would have done.

          9 waits, hopefully. But 5 looks away. He wants to do it,
          but he doesn't have the nerve. 9 nods, compassionately. He
          turns away. 5 hesitates, looking down, then:
          
                              5

          towards 9.

            and 9 look around constantly, on the alert for the Cat

          crumbling, disintegrating buildings surround them.

          hat lying in the dirt. He bends down to pick it up, brushing
          the dust off the top. 5 looks sadly at 2's broken hat.

          filling with hope, gets up too. 5 puts 2's hat on his
          quiver. 9 offers 2's staff to 5 but 5 gestures to 9 for him
          to hold it.

          tries to keep leading them forward.
          
          They come to a field full of trip mines and dangerous tank
          trap pits.   A parachute blows in the wind on a tree branch.
          
          5 turns the map one way and the other with growing panic.

          As he turns the map to look at it, the wind picks up and
          blows the map out of 5's hands. It blows away into the
          distance and gets stuck on a pole.
          
          5 reaches after it desperately but can't retrieve it.      He
          looks in despair at 9.

          OF THE BEAST.
          
          They inspect the footprints. 9 moves bravely towards the
          trench entrance. 5 resists, afraid.

          a battery and electrical wire from his chest, winds the wire
          around the battery and places it inside the hat.

          smiling at 9.

          has happened to 2.

          9 is conveying with his simple words that he believes 2 IS
          still alive and he WILL be impressed when he sees the
          lightstaff.
          
          9 shines the light to gesture "this way."
          
          5 smiles tremulously at 9, almost more grateful for his
          sympathy and support than necessarily believing him. He
          follows 9 to the mouth of the trench.
          
          The camera pans over to reveal catlike scratchmarks on a side

          They slide down a duct and land   in a pile of debris. They
          now see 2, imprisoned in an old   birdcage. In the b.g., the
          CAT BEAST lurks, next to a pile   of what seems like debris and
          broken machinery. The talisman    is on the floor next to the
          Cat Beast. The Cat Beast seems    to be looking for something
          in the debris. The Cat Beast's    back is to us.

                      Shhh...
          
          He motions towards the Beast.
          
          5 and 9 try to pry the bars open. 2 tries to help. They
          just manage to pry the bars open and get 2 out when--
          
          Suddenly a light SHINES above them. They look up and see --
          
          The Cat Beast beaming his light from his eye. It GROWLS.
          
          The three dolls run away frantically.    The Cat Beast chases
          after them.
          
          9 gets cornered but swipes the Beast and manages to escape.
          9 jumps a heap of debris but stumbles. 5 and 2 pull him up
          to higher ground.
          
              shoots his crossbow at the Cat Beast, shattering his eye.
          
          2 manages to hide in a tube.
          
          9 and 5 run away but get stuck at the end of a table.

          They climb onto another piece of debris, only to encounter
          the Cat Beast, now in front of them.
          
           he Cat Beast slashes a claw out and knocks them over.    The
          Cat Beast moves closer and closer. They are doomed.
          
           uddenly there is a strange rhythmic moaning sound.   The Cat
          Beast turns, distracted.
          
          We pan over and see a mysterious creature that seems to be
          half ragdoll, half bird, with a bird-skull head swinging a
          weapon over its head.   THIS IS 7. 7 releases the weapon--a
          strap of leather with weighted shot at either end. The
          weapon flies through the air with a low whooshing sound and
          strikes the Cat Beast, entangling it.
          
          7, 5, and 9 now charge the Cat Beast. 5 shoots his crossbow,
          entangling the Beast's paw and hobbling it. 9 and 2 both
          LURE THE CAT BEAST IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS, deliberately
          goading and further causing it to become entangled in the
          machinery.   7 now leaps up over the Beast and brings the
          full weight of her spear down on the Cat Beast's neck. The
          head of the Beast comes off and lands at their feet.
          7
              now pulls off her bird-skull helmet.
          
                                5

                                5

                      I never left. YOU finally decided
                      to join the fight.
          
           he hands 5's map back to him.
          
          9 comes over with her shield (lost during the fight).    7
          looks 9 over.

          They move towards her but she turns and looks at 9.     2 and 5
          nod proudly towards 9. 7 nods.
          
           hey all look at the fallen Cat Beast.

          They all turn to leave. 5 and 7 support 2 on either side of
          him, helping 2 along.   9 hangs back to look at the machine
          again, and suddenly sees the TALISMAN, lying on the floor.
          
          5, 7, and 2 have continued on without him and do not see him
          as he picks it up.
          
            looks at the strange object with ENORMOUS CURIOSITY. He
          turns it and see the RUNES on the side of it. He turns and
          inspects it closely.   He turns and discovers, on the
          machine, a PORT with the SAME RUNES.
          
          
                        (blurting out)
                    Look!
          
          The others now turn to see him. They see him holding the
          talisman close to the machine's port... about to
          experimentally put the talisman INTO the port.
          
                                  2
                    No!   Stop!       NO!
          
          2 tries to break free and stagger towards him but it is too
          late. 9 puts the talisman into the port.
          
           othing happens for a moment.
          
          Then suddenly, horribly, the ground begins to SHAKE.

          A mechanical ARM emerges and PINS 7, 9, and 5.
          
          As dust and debris rain down, we see one hideous RED EYE
          begin to come up.
          
           s 2 tries to scramble to safety, the other three ragdolls,
          pinned by the mechanical arm, stare in horror. We see that
          the "pile of Machinery" has risen to reassemble into an
          monstrous, towering FABRICATION MACHINE attached to the
          ceiling of the building.
          
          It is enormous, a spherical shape with a dozen folded
          appendages, each with different fabrication tools at the end
          of its long spindly robotic arms.
          
          2 tries to crawl away but the Machine grabs him with his
          robotic arm.
          T
           he Machine points the talisman towards 2 and it OPENS up to
          a sparking green glow. 2 struggles in the Machine's claw but
          the strange green energy SHOOTS directly into 2's mouth and
          eyes, painfully  his soul.
          
           NGLE on 2 as his soul is being taken.
          
          2 slumps over, his LIFELESS CARCASS smoking in the grip of
          the Machine.
          
           NGLE on the green glow as it PASSES into the machine. The
          sound has drawn its attention. The Machine turns towards
          them and grabs at them with its enormous claw. 9, 5, and 7
          turn and flee.
          
          The Fabrication Machine's arms chase after them. 5 shoots
          his grappling hook onto a switch. 9 and 7 grab onto him.
          
          Frantically working together, the three of them manage to
          escape the Machine's horrifying arms. [  Important to make
          sure the Machine is understood to be tethered to the
          Factory.]
          
          They see in the distance a pipe that leads out.
          
          In the Machine's RED POV, they run into it just as the
          Machine's arm is behind them but can't fit into the hole.

          artifacts.

          world before the apocalypse.

          beaming ideas to each other.   They look at 9, sizing him up.

          3 and 4 take 9's lightstaff. Their chattering and beaming
          gets more intense as they take it and catalogue it, their
          eyes clicking as if they're recording on film what they are
          seeing.
          
          7 stops them.   She has an urgent look on her face.

          to the twins.
          
          3 and 4 chatter, trying to analyze and catalogue the drawing
          of the Talisman. They shake their heads: they don't
          recognize it.
          
           eeing it as a drawing, 5 is startled.

                    there? In 2's old workshop?

                    answer is there.

          She points out towards the factory and strides off,
          dauntless, fine, and proud. The twins chatter unhappily,
          beaming flickering lights to each other.

          The WINGED BEAST tail crashes through the stained glass

          5, 6, 8 and 9 huddle together. Suddenly the Winged Beast
          comes crashing in the window behind them, knocking over the
          thurible and splashing hot coals all over the floor.

          5, 6, 8 and 9 see the Winged Beast emerge from the smoke
          pouring out of the upset thurible.
          
          The Winged Beast SHRIEKS at them. It catches its foot on the
          runner leading up to 1's empty throne. The hymnboard/
          calendar topples away to reveal 1 hiding behind it. 1
          instinctively clutches his staff causing the bell at the top
          of the staff to RING and attracting the Winged Beast's
          attention.
          1
            flees. 8 charges the Beast but it SCYTHES its wing towards
          him and knocks 8 across the floor. 8 slides across the floor
          to 1, who stands next to 6's picture of the Cat Beast.
          
          1 pushed the picture of the Cat Beast away to reveal a HIDDEN
          PASSAGEWAY. 1 runs away as 8 looks at the others for a brief
          moment before also running away.
          
          The Winged Beast turns its attention to 9, 5, and 6. The
          ragdolls run for the bucket and bell-ropes, but 9 trips. The
          Winged Beast advances towards him.   5 reaches out to 9.  9
          gestures to him to continue without him.
          
          As 9 recovers himself and makes a break for the bucket, 5
          starts to lower the bucket down. Just as the Winged Beast is
          about to catch up with him, 9 LEAPS down the shaft and lands
          in the bucket with 5 and 6.
          
          Angrily, the Beast lashes its harpoon tail down at them,
          piercing the bottom of the bucket. The bucket rocks and 6 is
          sent FLYING OUT but 5 CATCHES him in the nick of time.

          The Winged Beast starts reeling its harpoon tail in. Jerking
          back and forth, the bucket ascends, drawing the ragdolls
          closer and closer to the Beast.
          
          9 spots a SMALL LEDGE next to a stained glass window.
          
          He opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they should
          jump.
          
          The others hesitate, but then 9, 6, and 5 jump out of the
          bucket onto a swinging rope, and onto the ledge. The Winged
          Beast plummets down the shaft after them.

          The ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stained
          glass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the Cathedral's roof.
          
          9 sees 1 and 8 running across the roof and points to 5 and 6
          to look down there. Down on the roof, 1 and 8 see 5, 6, and
          9. 1 pushes past 8 and runs farther out, towards the front
          of the Cathedral. 8 follows.
          S
           uddenly, the Winged Beast SMASHES through the glass behind
          them. It struggles to get through the window but can't quite
          fit.
          
          6 is very vulnerable out there.
          
          9 turns to 5.
          
                                9
                      Take him inside.
          
              now climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully.
          
          The Winged Beast FLIES UP into the air, circling lazily.    1
          and 8, running on the top of the roof, are very exposed.
          Hawklike, the Winged Beast sails towards them.
          
          8 steps up to defend 1. He flips his salt-shaker helmet down
          over his face as armor, pulls out his scissor knife and
          stands his ground... waiting... waiting for the Winged Beast
          to soar in closer...
          
          And then, at the last possible moment, he HURLS his scissor
          knife at the Winged Beast. It flies through the air and
          catches in the Beast's propeller.
          
          Knocked off balance, the Beast swoops down. 1 ducks out of
          the way but it knocks 8 off his feet. 8 slides down the
          sloped edge of the roof, towards GAPING HOLE.

          Just as 8 is about to fall into the hole, he catches on to
          the edge. His other blade plummets through the hole as he
          hangs, desperately... his grip SLIPPING...
          
          9 catches up to where 1 is.

          The Winged Beast circles around and sets its harpoon tail to
          shoot. 1 squints into the sun as the Winged Beast, backlit,
          swoops down towards them. He sees a glare come from the tin
          roof. 9 gets an idea.    He gestures to 1 to help him. 1
          scowls, but has no alternative but to help him.
          
          9 peels back a piece of the roof, with 1 helping him.   The

          Blinded by the glare, it MISSES and almost hits 8.
          
          The harpoon imbeds itself into a rafter inside the Cathedral.

          5 and 6. 8's weight on the harpoon's line has pulled it more
          and more taut...
          
          The Winged Beast is pulled hard into the roof and slides
          down, knocking into 1 and 9.
          
          1 and 9 PLUNGE into the Cathedral and onto the plane wing,

          The Winged Beast plummets after them onto the wing. It picks
          itself up, spots the cowering ragdolls, and opens up his
          bladed beak screaming.
          
          The Winged Beast starts to charge them when suddenly--
          
          7 DROPS DOWN from a high parapet and leaps onto the Winged
          Beast's neck.
          
              and 8 stare in surprise.   9 stares in delight and relief.

                      7?
          
           mmediately, the beast throws her off towards the others.
          She'd dropped her spear; she goes to pick it up and
          
           PFFFFFFT> immediately, her leg is IMPALED by the Winged
          Beast, which has fired its harpoon. She is impaled next to
          the guys.

          But as she speaks, the Beast begins to reel her in.       She
          fights viciously.
          
              jumps and grabs on to 7 as she's being pulled away.

            grabs her forked spear and hands it to her. She grabs her
          forked spear and stabs it into the plane.   The harpoon's
          cable is pulled taut 9
                               between her leg and the Winged Beast.
          
          
                          (yelling to the others)
                      The cable! Cut it!
          
          8 runs to recover the blade that slipped from his grasp as he
          slid down the roof, then runs over and SLICES with all his
          brute force through the cable. The cable flies up in the air
          and WRAPS itself around the propeller on the end of the wing.
          
          The Winged Beast jerks back, towards the propeller, causing
          the whole wing of the plane to tilt, and the ragdolls to
          slide. 5 and 6 tumble into the plane's engine room.

          7 clutches her staff. 9 slides by her and grabs on to the
          harpoon, still lodged in her leg.
          
          9's staff slides by, and 9 catches it just before it falls
          off the wing. As 8 climbs up onto the same buttress fragment

                     Grab on!
          
          1 grabs 9's staff. Dangling, he sees that the Winged Beast
          is close behind, snapping at him with its beak.
          
          9 sees 5 and 6 in the engine room.

                     The propeller! Start the
                     propeller!
          
          6 nods. 5 points to the wires. 5 and 6 gather wires and set
          to work. They ZAP the propeller to life and it GROANS... then
          whines into motion as it starts taking up the power it had
          generated. It goes faster... faster...
          
          Even as the Beast is slowly drawn towards the propeller, it
          struggles forward and grabs 1's cape in its beak.
          
          As the Winged Beast pulls 1 closer, 9 strains to hang on to
          1, and 7 strains with the added weight on the harpoon
          sticking out of her wounded leg.
          
                               1
                     My... my cape!
          
                                  9
                     Let it go!
          
          1 glares furiously, hesitates, then undoes the clasp. The
          Winged Beast falls backwards down the wing, DIRECTLY INTO THE
          DEADLY BLADES.
          
          It is instantly shredded.
          
          Claws, feathers, and strange mechanical debris shower down.
          
           , 9, and 7 look in relief as the Beast is finally destroyed.
          
           fter the clasp is released, 1 has meanwhile recoiled into
          9's arms. There is a brief moment of awkwardness as 1 and 9
          realize how close they are physically to each other.

          1 begins to climb up the side of the wing, using dangling 9
          and 7 as a ladder.
          
          Perched on top of 7's staff, 1 reaches up for 8, who is
          crouched on the edge of the buttress. He grabs 8's hand,
          gesturing imperiously to 8 to pull him up.
          9
            looks at 7 urgently, nodding to her. She gets it
          immediately and grabs 1's leg, stopping him.
                  86                                                        186

                       ourselves!
          
          The plane teeters down to a 90 degree angle. 5 and 6 look up
          at the rest of the ragdolls from farther down the wing. 5 is
          concerned and almost panicked. 6 is almost zen-peaceful, as
          though he can foresee it will be all right.
          
              looks around and sees the rope tied around 7's waist.
          
          
                           (TO 7)
                       Your rope.
          
          7 throws it down to 9 who ties it to his own waist. The plane
          tilts... it's hanging even more precariously now... about to
          fall out of the side of the Cathedral entirely...
          
          9 suddenly jumps down into the flames just as the plane
          starts to fall. 7 shouts with stress.
          
          The plane EXPLODES as it hits the ground, smoke rising from
          the crash. The rope pulls taut, and after the smoke settles
          we can see 9 dangling with 5 and 6.
          
          8 pulls the hanging chain of ragdolls up and onto the
          buttress fragment.
          
           s 1 recovers himself and straightens his hat, he glances
          up... towards the smouldering clock tower...

          The Seamstress has sewed the carcass of "2" into her tail in

          seamstress suddenly darts one of her claws out, GRABS 7, and
          SLITHERS OFF out through the library [ALT: through part of a

           hey all bow their heads. The twins now slowly send 2
          floating down the remnants of water in the drainpipe at the
          bottom of the fountain.
          
          5 pulls out the piece of burlap from 2's back with his number
          on it. He hands it to 9.
          
              looks at 5, 9, and the twins soberly.
          
          They look at him.    Slowly, they nod, as though accepting
          their mission.
          
          1 sighs heavily. Suddenly he looks so very old, so very
          tired. He stares down at 2 floating away. Slowly, he nods
          as well.

          We pan down, and see SEEKER DRONES (that the newly vitalized
          Fabrication Machine has constructed) floating in the air
          around the factory, tirelessly looking for enemies. One of
          them floats near to camera and its searchlight fixes on
          something. We follow the light down.
          
          The light reveals a PUMPING OIL DERRICK, also newly awakened.
          Its pump moves up and down in sinister rhythm.
          
          The light moves away from the derrick. Camera stops
          following the light and keeps moving down, arriving at the
          ground where we now see, in the darkness--
          
          THE RAGDOLLS. They huddle behind an oil pipe waiting for the
          Seeker Drone to pass. 1 is weak, but is supported by 5, who
          has been patching him, and is just finishing up, pulling the
          last thread out of the patch he's sewn onto 1. 1 is
          regaining his strength. The twins huddle behind 6.
          
            looks out past the pumping derricks and sees AN ENTRANCE TO
          A COAL CHUTE.

              scowls.   5 nods, proudly taking the responsibility.
          
              darts purposefully towards the factory.
          
            looks around keenly, looking up for seeker drones, then
          runs out from cover, over to a huge barrel that lies half
          buried in the scorched earth.    A painting of the Dictator's
          symbol is stenciled on the side.
          
          He taps on the front. It is FULL. He looks up in the air at
          the seeker drones. They haven't seen him.
          
          We gestures to the others.
           e see the barrel is on top of a small hill that leads down
          to coal car tracks. The tracks lead to the open mouth of a
          coal chute that feeds into the factory.
          
          5 sees a bent spoon on the ground. He smiles, remembering 2
          and his ingenuity, and picks it up. He hands it to 1.

          With confidence now, he looks around. He sees a splintered
          pile of wood planks, the remains of a wooden derrick
          platform. He looks at the others and gestures to the wood.

          9 darts from hiding place to hiding place inside the darkened
          factory, moving towards the Fabrication Machine.
          
          He spots the half-blinded Seamstress and watches in HORROR as
          he sees that the Seamstress is giving 8 up to the Fabrication
          Machine. 9 is too late to do anything to stop the Machine
          from sucking 8's soul.
          
           here is a bright GREEN GLOW as 8's soul is sucked, and in
          the sudden illumination, 9 sees 7. She is sewn into the
          Seamstress--but is still alive!
          
           NGLE on 9 as he realizes she is still alive and he can still
          rescue her! From his hiding place he looks around for a way
          to rescue her. He inspects the machinery near him. He sees
          a LEVER and GEARS. He looks at his LIGHTSTAFF. He then
          spots a remnant of the FABRIC used to create the Winged
          Beast. We see he is formulating a plan. He darts his hand
          out to drag the fabric towards him.
          
           NGLE on the Fabrication Machine as it begins to power back
          up after taking 8's soul.
          
           NGLE on the Seamstress. She turns to get 7, and give her to
          the Fabrication Machine. We see the TERROR and DEFIANT FURY
          in 7's eyes, but she is immobilized and can do nothing.
          
          Suddenly the Seamstress hears a SOUND.   She whips around.
          P
           OV through the Seamstress's damaged eye: a MOVEMENT in the
          shadows.
          
           he Seamstress, distracted from her morbid mission with 7,
          slithers towards the movement.
          
          In the shadow we see a RAGDOLL with GLOWING EYES. 7 sees
          this and registers recognition, relief, and also TERROR at
          what will be 9's fate. But she is unable to move or speak
          and now, just as 9 could only watch 8's soul being sucked
          out, 7 can only helplessly watch as the Seamstress slithers
          closer and closer to its prey. We see the misery on 7's
          face.
          
          The seamstress raises her needles and STRIKES the ragdoll,
          sewing wildly.

          The ragdoll SWINGS OUT from a string attached to a lever.
          The lever now moves down (because of the weight of the
          ragdoll) and SWITCHES on machinery. Gears start to turn and
          we see the ragdoll is attached and begins to drag the trapped
          seamstress in, arms first.
          
           he gears CRUNCH the ragdoll. 7 FLINCHES... but then her
          expression turns to amazement as she suddenly sees it is not
          a ragdoll at all but is 9'S LIGHT-STAFF DRESSED IN FABRIC.
          Instinctively, she looks up, a sudden hopeful look on her
          face... just as
          
          9 SWINGS IN and lands on the SEAMSTRESS, tearing a hole in
          her back. He slides down the length of her body, FREEING 7.
          
          7 and 9 fall to the ground as the gears now CRUSH THE
          SEAMSTRESS.

          5, 1, 6, and the twins crouch behind the barrel. We see they
          have built two paths of wooden boards leading down to the
          entrance of the coal chute, have dug a trench under the
          barrel, and have placed a long bar of metal beneath the
          barrel.

                    PULL!
          
          They all pull down with all their weight. The barrel lifts
          and teeters, then tips and RACES DOWN THE HILL. At the
          bottom, it launches off the boards, spinning into the air and
          landing on the rails to the coal chute with a sparking crash.
          
           he ragdolls race down after it.
          
          The barrel rolls and comes to a stop right at the mouth of
          the coal chute.

          9 warmly clasps her arm. She pats his hand.     They look with
          great affection and appreciation at each other.
          
          The twins chatter: they've found an old Victrola lying in the
          debris, with an old warped record still on it. They climb
          onto the record, tripping the needle arm onto the disc, and
          begin walking on the record.
          
          A scratchy old melody comes from the large Victrola
          amplifying horn. 7 smiles at the sound of the music. She
          leaps on the record, joining them. As they walk faster, the
          music speeds up.

          catches his hat as it begins to slip off his head.

          shatters.

          as well.
          
          9 and 1 go over together to the Victrola. 7 notices as 9
          helps 1 climb up on the Victrola and starts to celebrate.

          at him, sucking his soul into its portal. The Machine's eye
          turns green showing it has absorbed the soul, then back to
          glowing red.

          scrambling, desperately trying to get up the hill and escape.

          The bridge starts to give way 9 and 7 run to the other side.
          9's light staff slides and falls down into the dark crevice.
          
          The Fabrication Machine is now hanging off of one side of the
          bridge, still holding on to 6.

            and 7 flee wildly across the disintegrating bridge. They
          make it across to the other ragdolls at the other end of the

          The Fabrication Machine tries to back up on the bridge but
          ends up getting caught in the beams, which form a cage around
          him. The other ragdolls yell to 6 from the other side of the
          bridge.
          
          The Fabrication Machine brings 6 up to its eye.

          He looks up and climbs up onto the table.
          
           e sees the machine that he fell out of.      He sees diagrams.
          
          He sees a journal, with drawings and thoughts. The drawings
          include: the original machine... the talisman... sketches of
          the dolls... the diagram that we saw in the Library
          manuscript...
          
           e looks further and sees a strip of film. Curiously, he
          picks it up, and now sees it's feeding into a rickety old
          movie projector which now TURNS ON and we see --

          SEQUENCE [It can be the exact same footage, or can be
          slightly altered if necessary for our uses here; if we still
          want to hear the radio it should be mixed in very low, so we
          are aware of it but it doesn't interfere with the scientist's
          dialogue. This is constructed so the scientist can be in
          V.O. only until the end, but if possible we can also see the
          back of the scientist in the first few pieces of footage].

          WAS ADDRESSING THE DOLLS.

          WE PULL OUT of the footage to see 9, looking in astonishment
          at the flickering footage.

          The scientist puts the strange face mask on and 9's POV is
          suffused with a GREEN GLOW.   The talisman clicks shut, the
          soul transfer completed. We hear the scientist fall to the
          ground, his soul depleted.
          
           ACK TO PRESENT TIME:
          
          9 comes out of his vision. He looks over the side of the
          table at the dead scientist.
          
              walks to the scientist and stares at the dead man.

          He reaches out to the skeletal hand clutching the box, then
          simply touches the Scientist's hand, tenderly. He looks up,
          a new, resolute look in his eyes.

          9 pauses at the enormity of it.      Finally:
          
                              9
                    He... he used his own soul.

                    us. It was warped, reprogrammed to
                    hunt humanity. It, and the

                    back.

          The Fabrication Machine appears from BEHIND THE CANNON. The
          ragdolls are CAUGHT OFF GUARD and scramble to get away just
          as its claw SMASHES down, DEMOLISHING THE CANNON.
          
          The dolls fly back from the blast. 9 is the only one
          standing. 9 deliberately walks towards the Machine. 7
          rushes over, trying to pull him away.

          The Machine swipes at 9 with its claw. 7 tries to stop it
          from getting 9. The Machine sends her flying. She lands
          badly and can't get up immediately. The Machine regroups,
          then begins to re-approach 9. 9 stays put.

                    Yes, it does. You'll see.      I'll
                    let it take my soul. Then

          The Machine raises its claw to grab 9 when suddenly 9 is

                      What right did they have to burden
                      us? Why did we have to right their
                      wrongs? So I refused. I refused
                      our path. But now... I see... we
                      cannot refuse it.   We are all
                      that's left.   We must complete

           ith a horrible green glow the machine TAKES HIS SOUL.     The
          twins look away, distressed.

                      NO--NO--
          
          But the machine RISES UP TERRIFYINGLY. It looks for a moment
          as though 9 was wrong and they're all going to be killed.
          They all cringe with horror.
          
          But then, as 9 had remembered, the Machine powers down to
          "digest" 1's soul.
          9
              darts in and GRABS the TALISMAN.

          crumples, dead. Sparks and smoke spew from it. Oil bubbles
          down its sides. It is lifeless--just a pile of jumbled
          machinery.

          Smoke rises from the center of a funeral pyre the dolls have
          made.
          
           t is a circular pyre, with spokes reaching out from the
          center.
          
          At the end of each spoke is the burlap skin of one of the
          fallen ragdolls, with its number stretched across a pole.
          
          In the center, a small FIRE flickers.
          
          9 stands in front of the last pole, holding 5's skin in his
          hands. He looks down at it in his hands and sadly places it
          upon the pole, looking up towards it.
          
           he twins come in with artifacts from the Scientist's studio.
          The journal. The tiny box. They put them down to the side.
          
            and 7 take the Talisman and place it IN THE CENTER, in
          front of the fire.
          
           he Talisman pulsates, vibrates, and shakes, and, finally
          BURSTS. A huge GREEN GLOW reaches up to the sky and the
          ragdolls' souls emerge.
          
          8 emerges and walks to his number. He nods to 9, 7, and the
          twins. They nod back, acknowledging the fierce warrior.
          
          2 comes out with 5 close behind.   5 places an arm around 2.
          
            emerges from the Talisman energy.   He sees his key and
          caresses it.
          
          1 emerges and comes over to stand next to 9. He nods,
          acknowledging that 9 has finally completed the mission.     He
          looks up to the sky. The others follow his gaze.
          
          Together, spirits and living, they all watch together, and
          watch as the beam shoots up to the sky. We see THE SKY
          CHANGING, HEALING, RENEWING ITSELF.
          
          A healing rain begins to fall.

          The souls of the slain ragdolls now rise and dissipate into
          the healing energy.
          
          9 and 7 watch.   7 puts her arm around 9.
          
          The twins chatter: they've taken 6's key and tried it in the
          little box's keyhole. It opens the box. 7 and 9 go over as
          the box is opened:
          
          It is a music box.
          
          As they see themselves reflected in it, they see the word
          "HOPE."
          
          Camera pulls back slowly... revealing a tiny tendril of green
          grass growing.

TITLE: THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK, DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY                                            3

Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4

In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around
BARNES, the sonarman.

                                CAPTAIN
                Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't
                have anything that fast.

                                BARNES
                Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique
                signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...
                doesn't even sound like screws.

He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey.

                                CAPTAIN
                What the hell is it?

                                EXEC
                I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of
                ours.

                                BARNES
                Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four,
                diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots!

                                EXEC
                Eighty knots...

                                BARNES

                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the
intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side-
scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.

                                EXEC
                          (low, to Captain)

                We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come
                right to oh six niner, down five degrees.

                                HELMSMAN

                narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a
                proximity warning light.

                                EXEC
                That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off.

                Nothing goes one thirty!

Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.

We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     6

The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted.

                Turbulence!  We're in its wake!

                Planes are not responding, sir!

Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan
display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM.

The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!

INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8

With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner
hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods,
blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray.

INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9

Everyone is hurled off his feet.  The planesman flights to recover control of
the yoke.

The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.

INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM                                               11

The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified.

The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din...

                                CAPTAIN
                We're losing her.  Launch the buoy!

The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button.  A red light
comes on.  The Captains takes a deep breath.

EXT. MONTANA                                                            12

A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface.  A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.

INT. MONTANA                                                            13

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as...
Seawater blasts down the corridors --
Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls --
Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds --
Bursts through hatches into the reactor room --
Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second.

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER                                                   14

In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.  Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough.  The abyss.

EXT. OCEAN SURFACE -- DAY                                               15

Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky.  The
Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting.

EXT. OCEAN/20 MILES AWAY -- DAY                                         16

LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.

REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.

The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum "company man" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/BRIDGE -- DAY                                     17

The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation
and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video
monitors.  The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX,
the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.

                                MCBRIDE
                Does not look good at all.

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working in total
blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean.  They
move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like
space-suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses.

                                DEMARCO (V.O.)
                No light from the surface.  How deep are they?

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                Seventeen hundred feet.

WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead.

                                DEMARCO
                I need them to go to over two thousand.

                                KIRKHILL
                They can do it.
                              (to McBride)
                Get Brigman on the line.

EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY (TOTAL DARKNESS)                                 18

1700 FEET BELOW.  A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two "tri-
modules" consisting of three cylinders each.  These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
"toolpusher," BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.

                                BUD
                Hey, you guys are milking that job.

                                CATFISH

Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor.  The working heart of
the rig.  THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR.  The drill crew, in hardhats and mud-
plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY
DIETZ.  Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive
roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest.

                                JAMMER
                               (yelling)
                Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call
                from topside.  That new company man.

                                BUD
                Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from
                a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

One of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him.

                                BUD
                Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and
                those cable slings.  This place is starting to
                look like my apartment.

Perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully.  Bud EXITS, ducking his head
through a low watertight hatch.

INT. CORRIDOR/TOOLPUSHER'S OFFICE                                       21

Bud tromps down the narrow corridor, his work boots gonging on steel.

                                P.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE)
                BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT.

                                BUD
                I'm coming.  Keep your pantyhose on.

He enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust-
gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs.  He picks up the
phone... punches down a line.

                                BUD
                Brigman here.  Kirkhill?  What's going on?
                              (pause)
                I am calm.  I'm a calm person.  Is there some
                reason why I shouldn't be calm?

HOLD ON Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens.

INT. CORRIDOR/CONTROL MODULE                                            22

The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago,
packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN.

Hippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch.

He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked
DIVER RECALL.  A SIREN, blasting through the water from a big hydrophone
loudspeaker.

                                BUD
                All divers.  Drop what you're doing.  Everybody
                out of the pool.

EXT. DEEPCORE/CHRISTMAS TREE                                            A22

Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Here you go, hon'.

                                SONNY
                Just in time, sugar.

They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Dammit, we just got out here.

                                SONNY
                There was a time when I would have asked why.

One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he
narrowly avoids.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER SUB-BAY                                             23

Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny
riding on its top deck.  It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the
surface of the water in the chamber above.  Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog.

INT. SUB-BAY/MOONPOOL                                                   24

The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched
through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-
fingered.  Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish
face.

                                FINLER
                What's goin' on?  How come we got recalled?

                                SONNY
                Hell is I know.

One Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them.  Catfish
is unzipping his bulky dry-suit.

                                CATFISH
                Just follow standard procedure, will ya...
                flog the dog till somebody tells us what's
                happening.

                                JAMMER
                Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse
                for twenty bucks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all
                stuck together by now.

Bud enters, approaching the group.

                                JAMMER
                What's goin' on, Boss?

                                BUD
                Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole
                and prepare to move the rig.

                                SONNY
                She-hit.

                                BUD
                We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of
                national security.  Now you know exactly as much
                as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to
                control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten
                minutes.

The whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing.
DeMarco is on the main monitor, with his aides and Kirkhill visible b.g.

                                DEMARCO
                At 09:22 local time this morning, an American
                nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men
                aboard, went down 22 miles from here.  There has
                been no contact with the sub since then.  The
                cause of the incident is not known.

PAN AROUND the reactions of the various drill crew members... shocked,
hushed, curious.

                                DEMARCO
                Your company has authorized the Navy's use of
                this facility for a rescue operation.  The code
                name is Operation Salvor.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You want us to search for the sub?

                                DEMARCO
                No.  We know where it is.  But she's in 2000 feet
                of water and we can't reach her.  We need divers
                to enter the sub and search for survivors, if
                any.

Bud's scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to talk.

                                BUD
                Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type
                of thing?

                                DEMARCO
                By the time we get our rescue submersible here
                the storm front will be right on us.  But you
                can get your rig in under the storm and be on-
                site in fifteen hours.  That makes you our best
                option right now.

Hippy, born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid, leans forward...

                                HIPPY
                Why should we risk our butts on a job like this?

                                KIRKHILL
                I have been authorized to offer you all special-
                duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal
                dive pay.

                                CATFISH
                Hell, for triple time I'd crawl through razor
                blades and shower off with lime juice.

                                FINLER
                I'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire
                and call me names.

                                BUD
                Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys
                worked out with the company, but my people are
                not qualified for this... they're oil workers.

                                DEMARCO
                A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to you
                to supervise the operation.

                                BUD
                You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the
                toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the
                safety of these people, there's me... then
                there's God.  Understand?  If things get dicey,
                I'm pulling the plug.

                                KIRKHILL
                I think we're all on the same wavelength,
                Brigman.  Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
                shall we?

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE AND CORRIDOR                               26

Bud stands beside the hatchway as the others file out toward their tasks.
They comment gravely as they pass...

                                JAMMER
                When Lindsey finds out about this, it's not
                gonna be a pretty sight.

                                ONE NIGHT
                They're going to have to shoot her with a
                tranquilizer gun.

EXT. OCEAN -- DAY                                                       27

A single Navy Sea King churns through the rain under massive thunderheads.
The sea below is whipped by the storm.

INT./EXT. SEA KING                                                      28

PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.

WIDER, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs.  And a slender woman in
her early thirties.  She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket.  Meet LINDSEY.  Project Engineer for
Deepcore.  She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.  Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.  The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.  They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.  The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position.  Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic
Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.

                                PILOT
                No way I'm putting her down.  I shouldn't even
                be flying in this shit.

                                COFFEY
                                (cool)
                Just hold it over the deck.

Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft.  He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK.  In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil.  One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping
to the deck.  One, two, three.  Coffey looks at her.

                                COFFEY
                You want to be on that ship, there's only one
                way it's going to happen.

He's sure she won't go for it.  It's his certainty that gets her.  She sets
her jaw.  Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth.  Then grabs
the rope and slides down.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/HELIPAD                                           29

Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty
feet to the deck.  She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides.  Her nylons are
ruined.  An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling.  The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck.  They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.

BLACKNESS.  Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock.
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables.  Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern
thrusters.

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            31

Bud, his feet propped up, uses joystick controls to 'fly' Deepcore,
maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles.  He is guided
by the side-scan sonar display, with Hippy assisting in the sonar shack.
Through the front viewport, Flatbed can be seen out ahead.

McBride appears on the bridge monitor, holding a sheet of weather-fax.

                                MCBRIDE (on screen)
                Well, it's official, sportsfans.  They're calling
                it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be
                making our lives real interesting in a few hours.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                             32

Bud responds via video.

                                BUD
                Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be
                named after women.

McBride looks up as the bridge door opens.  Lindsey enters in a blast of wind,
wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off.  Maybe Bud is right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            33

Bud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen.

                                LINDSEY
                I can't believe you let them do this!

                                BUD
                     (unpreturbed, almost cheerful)
                Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

                                LINDSEY
                I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last
                flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left
                it, is it, Bud?

                                BUD
                Wasn't up to me.

                                LINDSEY
                We were that close to proving a submersible
                drilling platform could work.  We had over seven
                thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I
                can't believe you let them grab my rig!

                                BUD
                Your rig?

                                LINDSEY
                My rig.  I designed the damn thing.

                                BUD
                Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long
                as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they
                tell me.

                                LINDSEY
                You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They
                bought you... more like least rented you cheap--

                                BUD
                I'm switching off now.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up
                to fight.  You--

Bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead.

                                BUD
                Bye.

Hippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up.

                                HIPPY
                Virgil?

                                BUD
                God, I hate that bitch.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah, well you never should have married her then.

Bud nods fatalistically.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. EXPLORER DECK/LAUNCH WELL                                          34

Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.  It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls.  Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.

Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.

She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck.  Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go, gentlemen!  We either launch now or
                we don't launch.

Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.

                                LINDSEY
                Take her up, Byron!

Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.  The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well.  It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below.  Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             35

Kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window.

                                KIRKHILL
                What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a
                bitch...
                           (into microphone)
                Lindsey... get out of Cab Three.  Bates is taking
                her down.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          36

Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the
hatch.

                                LINDSEY
                Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in
                this thing than he does.
                              (to Coffey)
                A little change of plan.

The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs,
jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into
the walls.  Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks.

                                COFFEY
                Lady, we better fish or cut bait.

                                LINDSEY
                Just hold your water, okay?
                             (to Kirkhill)
                So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk
                about it?

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             37

The plug is pulled on DeMarco's patience.

                                DEMARCO
                I don't care who drives the damn thing.  Just get
                my team in the water.

                                KIRKHILL
                Alright, alright.  Christ Almighty!

He gestured dismissively to McBride.

                                MCBRIDE
                Cab Three, you are clear to launch.

INT./EXT. CAB THREE                                                     38

Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever.

                                LINDSEY
                Roger.
                              (to Coffey)
                There's only one way it's going to happen...

She pulls the lever hard.  CLUNK-CLANG!  The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks.  Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.

                                LINDSEY
                Touchdown.  The crowd goes wild.  Explorer...
                Cab Three.  We are styling.

                                MCBRIDE (filtered)
                Roger, Cab Three.

Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so
that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port.  Moving up
through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig.  Cab Three free-falls
into increasing darkness.  Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo.

EXT./INT. FLATBED                                                       39

One Night is driving the tug one-handed, pouring coffee from a thermos and
rocking out to the great truck-driving song "Willing" on the beat-box she's
got propped up on the sonar rig.  Fighting white-line fever in the best
tradition.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     40

Bud and Hippy come in for a rousing chorus.

                                BUD/HIPPY
              ... I've been driving every kinda rig that's

Lit up like a proud Peterbilt, the rig crossed the trackless wastes.  We
hear them singing, carried OVER.

EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS/CAB THREE                                             42

In total blackness, the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the
umbilical cable.  Two hundred feet below it, the lights of Deepcore resolve
out of the darkness.  Now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom
like some monster lawnmower.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on
                final approach.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You,
                Lindsey?

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            43

Bud stop singing and snaps around at the mention of her name.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                None other.

Bud's expression is nothing less than stricken.

                                BUD
                Oh no... you gotta be kidding me.

EXT./CAB THREE/DEEP CORE                                                44

Lindsey executes a 180 degree turn and cruises over the control module, back
through the A-frame toward the docking hatch.  The flange of Cab Three's
lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rig's back.  There is
a CLUNK as it mates up.

INT. DEEPCORE/COMPRESSION CHAMBER/GAS CONTROL STATION                   45

Lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber.
The SEALs drop down behind her, passing their gear through hand-over-hand.
The chamber is spartan, with steel benches, a folding card table, breathing
masks, and medical supplies.  Catfish greets them through the tiny porthole
at one end.

                                CATFISH
                Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned!
                You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll
                might run ya stockings.

                                LINDSEY
                Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us?
                Good.  Couldn't ask for better.

                                CATFISH
                Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.

HISSSS of inrushing compressed gas.  The pressure in the chamber rises.  The
breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen.  Catfish
monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the
gauges with a practiced eye.  Lindsey and the SEALs all grab their noses
and start making funny faces... popping their ears with the familiar diver's
'equalization' technique.  They continue as:

                                LINDSEY
                Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six
                hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news
                is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress
                back to the surface later.

                                COFFEY
                We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright,
                from now on we watch each other closely for
                signs of HPNS...

                                MONK
                           (as if by rote)
                High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors,
                usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased
                excitability, disorientation.

                                LINDSEY
                Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't
                handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to
                predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.

                                COFFEY
                Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth.
                We're checked out.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.
                          (Coffey turn away)
                Well, hey... you guys know any songs?

They ignore her.  Start going over some diagrams of the Montana's interior.
It's going to be a long six hours.

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION -- HOURS LATER                                 46

Catfish checks his watch, then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri-
mix manifold, watching the gauges.  Satisfied, he leans over to the pressure
window in the door, checking out the SEALs.  Hippy has come down from the
control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers.  Jammer is in a chair,
reading a Louis L'Amour paperback.

                                CATFISH
                Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of
                guys tougher'n them.

                                HIPPY
                Now we get to hear about how he used to be a
                contender.

Catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of Hippy's face.

                                CATFISH
                You see this?  They used to call this the Hammer.

                                JAMMER
                Hippy wasn't born then.

INT. PRESSURE CHAMBER                                                   47

It looks like the end of a long bus trip.  Everyone silent... leafing
through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring.  Lindsey has her feet propped
up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases.  She casually toes open
one of the latches, then the other.  Glances at Coffey.  He's reading.  She
begins to lift the lid with her toe.  Gets a GLIMPSE INSIDE, of packing foam,
and what looks like a SMALL BLACK METAL BOX.  Then... WHAM!  Coffey's foot
comes down on the lid, slamming it shut.  Startled, she looks up into his
cool gaze.

                                COFFEY
                Curiosity killed the cat.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION/CHAMBER DOOR -- LATER                          48

TIGHT ON CATFISH'S hands... closing values... spinning the wheel on the
chamber hatch.  CUT WIDER as it cracks open with a virgin's sigh and swings
aside.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all'er done to a turn and ready to serve.
                Everybody okay?

The SEALs nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear.  Lindsey exists first,
followed by Monk, Wilhite, and Schoenick.  Coffey bends to relatch the small
equipment case.  He is alone for one moment in the chamber.  He raises his
hand and stares at it.  The fingertips are trembling the slightest bit.  He
clenches them into a fist and walks out.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           49

As Lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig, she bumps into a large,
dark mass.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey, was there a wall here before?  I don't
                remember a wall here.  Oh, Jammer!  Hi.

The 'wall' grins down to her.

                                JAMMER
                Howdy, there, little lady.

Coffey emerges behind them and, ignoring Lindsey, faces Jammer.

                                COFFEY
                              (to Jammer)
                Show us the dive prep area.  We need to check
                out your gear.

Jammer scowls, turns and leads the SEALs in the sub-bay.  Catfish and Lindsey
exchange a look.

                                LINDSEY
                Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     50

TIGHT ON HIPPY, bathed in the light of the sonar display.  He is making
kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's
lips.

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.

WIDER, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway.  She and Bud
size each other up.  He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary.

                                BUD
                Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Not for long.

Lindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost
unconsciously checking, checking... getting the pulse of her big iron baby.

                                BUD
                You never did like being called that, did you?

                                LINDSEY
                Not even when it meant something.
                     (looking through the front port)
                Is that One Night up in Flatbed?

                                BUD
                Who else?

Lindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console.

                                LINSEY
                Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey.

INT. FLATBED                                                            51

One Night mimes a puking motion, finger down her throat.  Then she replies
with sickening sweetness...

                                ONE NIGHT
                Oh, hi, Lindsey.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     52

Lindsey fives the sonar shack the once-over.  She tweaks some knobs.

                                BUD
                I can't believe you were dumb enough to come
                down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm...
                dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, I didn't come down here to fight.

She crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor.  Bud bolts out of the chair
to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to take over.

INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER-WELL/LEVEL ONE LANDING                             53

Bud catches up with Lindsey in the corridor, and through the following keeps
pace with here as she make here inspection.

                                BUD
                Then why'd you come down?

She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe.  He almost slams into her.  She
moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level.

                                LINDSEY
                You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this
                rig better than I do.  What is something was
                to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What
                would have you done?

                                BUD
                Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've
                had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a
                disaster.

On the lower level landing, Lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine
rooms.  ROAR OF PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       54

Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and
roaring machinery.  Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit
panels.

                                BUD
                             (yelling)
                You wanna know what I think?

                                LINDSEY
                Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set!
                Morons.

She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely.

                                BUD
                I think you were worried about me.

                                LINDSEY
                That must be it.

Lindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up.

                                BUD
                No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.

                                LINDSEY
                I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four
                years invested in this project.

                                BUD
                Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years
                with me.

She looks up at him.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got to have priorities.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. BUD'S ROOM                                                         55

Darkness.  The door opens and Bud snaps on the light.

                                BUD
                My bunk's the only one I can guarantee won't be
                occupied.  You can grab a couple hours before
                we get there.

Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the
rig.  Rank had its privileges.  His hand on the door is just level with her
eyes.  She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium
(something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from
M.I.T.).

                                LINDSEY
                What are you still wearing that for?

                                BUD
                I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to
                take it off.

Bud stays in the doorway.  Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the
narrow bunk.  Start unconsciously straightening the room.

                                LINDSEY
                I haven't worn mine in months.

                                BUD
                Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The
                Suit.

                                LINDSEY
                Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit?
                It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name
                is Michael.

Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks.

Bud eyes her, sounding too causal.

                                BUD
                So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks
                Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?

                                LINDSEY
                No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

                                BUD
                What happened?

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of
                you life any more.

                                BUD
                I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one
                day and realized the guy never made you laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple.
                Aren't you clever?  You should get your own
                show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn
                from three hundred fathoms.

She closes the watertight door, forcing him out.  Locks it.  She turns and
throws her shoe hard against the far wall.

                                LINDSEY
                AAAARRRGGH!

She flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall.  Her armor is
gone.  She looks small and vulnerable.  A long beat.  She reaches over to the
tiny sink.  Amid the clutter is a bottle of Bud's aftershave.  She unscrews
it and takes a sniff.  Catches herself.  Tosses it.

                                LINDSEY
                Shit.

INT. QUARTERS/HEAD                                                      56

Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger.  He pulls
the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet.  He reaches forward to
flush.  Can't do it.  Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the
toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring.
He puts it on and washes his hands.  The right hand stays faintly blue no
matter how hard he scrubs.

                                BUD
                Shit.

                                                                CUT TO:

The platform is stopped, hovering in place.  Like a great spacecraft setting
down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze.  Flatbed
releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH, actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from
a towed LIDAR (laser imaging sonar) rig.  It shows a faint, blurry outline of
the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall.  There
is no detail.  A finger points to a flat ledge nearby.  An "X" has been put
on with a grease pencil.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                This is us.  We're just on the edge of the Cayman
                Trough.  The Montana is here, on its side, 300
                meters away and 70 meters below us.  We think she
                slid down the wall, and lodged against this
                outcropping.

CUT WIDE, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub-bay.
The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have
their dry-suits on.  The pre-dive briefing.  Lindsey, One Night, and Hippy
will crew the submersibles.  Wilhite is going around clipping DOSIMETER
BADGES on everybody.

                This tells us how much radiation we get?

                Hey, whoah... I can't handle no radiation, man.
                Forget it!  Include me out.

                                COFFEY
                We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's
                breached or the warheads have released
                radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.

                                BUD
                Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you
                can run Little Geek.

Bud pats the top of a small ROV, sitting next to its larger brother, Big
Geek.

                                HIPPY
                No way!  No way!  He can't fly an ROV worth
                shit.  I'll go.  Shit!

                                COFFEY
                               (to all)
                On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing
                without direct orders from me, and you will
                follow my instructions without discussion.  Is
                this clear?  Alright, I want everyone finished
                prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.

The rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear.  Some are studying
the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout.  Bud takes Coffey aside as
the others prepare.

                                BUD
                Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on
                bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better
                start cutting them some slack.

                                COFFEY
                I can't afford slack, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me,
                you start ordering my guys around.  It won't
                work.  You gotta know how to handle these
                people... we have a certain way of doing things
                here.

                                COFFEY
                I'm not interested in your way of doing things.
                Just get your team ready to dive.

End of discussion.  Coffey is walking away.  Burning, Bud crosses to his gear
locker.  Picks up his helmet.  Finler is suiting out next to him.

                                FINLER
                Hey, you know your hand is blue?

                                BUD
                Shut up and get your gear on.

NEARBY, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable.  Hippy
points to the heavy equipment case that says F.B.S. DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.

                                HIPPY
                I've been meaning to ask you what this thing is.

Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like
a space helmet, and a large backpack.

                                MONK
                Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We
                use it if we need to go really deep.

                                HIPPY
                How deep?

                                MONK
                Deep.
                     (shrugs)
                It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you
                breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed.
                Pressure doesn't get to you.

Catfish is grappling with the concept.

                                CATFISH
                You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?

                                MONK
                Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.

Monk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf and dumps them
out.  He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside
it to drain into the box.  Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's
shoulder.

                                HIPPY
                Hey!

                                MONK
                Check this out.

He drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid.
Beany is forced under the surface.  He struggled for a second, and bubbles
come out of his mouth.  Then he casually swims around in there, completely
submerged... breathing liquid.  Catfish and the others stare into the box,
amazed.

                                MONK
                See?  He's diggin' it.

Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his
lungs.  Then hands him back to Hippy.  The rat is annoyed, but otherwise
alright.

                                CATFISH
                This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest
                thing I ever saw.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/DROPOFF                                                   59

Three sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore.  Cab One and Three,
with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the
Flatbed.  Lindsey is in the lead.  She approaches the cliff-like drop-off
and starts to descend.

                                LINDSEY
                Com-check, everybody.  Flatbed, you on line?

                                ONE NIGHT
                Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and clear.

                                LINDSEY
                Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                What's you depth, Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                1840... 50... 60... 70...

                                LINDSEY
                Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065.
                Everybody stay tight and in sight.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Starting out descent.  Divers, how're you doing?

EXT. FLATBED                                                            60

Eight divers ride the back of Flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to
the fields.  Bud and his civilian crew, Catfish, Finler, and Jammer... sit
across from the SEALs.  They are in their gear and breathing from umbilical
hooked in Flatbed's low-pressure manifold.

                                BUD
                Okay so far.

                                JAMMER
                How deep's the drop-off here?

                                CATFISH
                This here's the bottomless pit, baby.  Two and
                a half miles straight down.

                                COFFEY
                Knock off the chatter.  Cab One, you getting
                anything?

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       61

Lindsey consults her array of instruments.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, do you see it yet?

                                LINDSEY
                The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing
                a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are
                you sure you got the depth right on this?

                                BUD (V.O., filtered)
                You should be almost to it, ace.

She turns the submersible and...

The spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the Montana.  It
dwarfs Cab One, FILLING FRAME.

                                LINDSEY
                Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.

EXT. MONTANA/SUBMERSIBLES                                               62

Cab One maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab
Three move above it.  Wilhite take readings with a hand-held neutron counter.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, radiation readings?

                                LINDSEY
                Neutron counter's not showing very much.

                                COFFEY
                Wilhite, anything?

                                WILHITE
                Negative.  Nominal.

                                COFFEY
                Just continue forward along the hull.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want
                me to get shots of everything, right?

                                COFFEY
                Roger, document as much as you can, but keep
                moving.  We're on a tight timeline.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that.

The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the
puny beams of their lights.  It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as
eerie in its final resting place.  On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a
wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving.  Ahead, in the lights, is
a white painted circle.

                                COFFEY
                That's the midship hatch.  You see it, Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                Roger, I see it.

                                BUD
                Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.

                                HIPPY
                Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?

                                COFFEY
                Right.

                                ONE NIGHT
                How do you want me?

                                COFFEY
                Just hold above it.  Alright, A team.

Wilhite, Schoenick, and Monk unhook their short whip-umbilicals from the
central manifold and roll off the side of Flatbed.  They maneuver down toward
the sub's hatch.  Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          63

Hippy turns to Perry back in the lockout chamber, ready to launch Little Geek.
The ROV has a handheld neutron-counter gripped in its manipulator arm.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Stand by on the ROV.

                                HIPPY
                Perry, stand by on the ROV.
                           (to Little Geek)
                Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than
                me, know what I mean?

Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and
feed out a length of tether.  Hippy picks up the control box and watches the
video screen, guiding the ROV toward the Montana's hatch.

EXT. MONTANA HATCH AREA                                                 64

The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.  They
open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.  He bangs
on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed
against it.

                                MONK
                It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up.

Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims
backs out immediately.  He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and
Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE/MISSLE DECK                                           65

Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull.  Beyond
Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll
toward us in procession.  Several of the hatch covers have been forced
partway open by the warping of the hull.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still
                be intact.

                                LINDSEY
                How many are there?

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.

                                LINDSEY
                That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are
                they?

                                SCHOENICK
                Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons
                nominal yield.  Say times time Hiroshima.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a
                can.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Let's knock off the chatter, please.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          66

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN -- LITTLE GEEK'S CAMERA.  Passing through a hatch, into
a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery.  The engine room.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Getting a reading?

                                HIPPY
                It's twitching but it's below the line you said
                was safe.

EXT. MONTANA MIDSHIP HATCH                                              67

Monk moves into the opening.

                                MONK
                Alright.  Let's get in there.

Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark
corridor beyond.

EXT. MONTANA/BOW SECTION                                                68

Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a
five-story building.  Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the
ledge which supports the vast sub.  Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal
the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.  The torn
and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down.

Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away
from the rest of the hull.

                                COFFEY
                We'll go in through that large breach.

                                BUD
                Let's go, guys.

Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.  The opening is a black mouth in
their lights.  Coffey moves inside.  Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon
line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him.

                                BUD
                Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in
                sight.  Watch for hatches that could close on
                you, or any loose equipment that could fall.

Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside.

INT. MONTANA/FORWARD BERTHING SECTION                                   69

They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of
bunks.  The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the
bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs.  Papers float in gentle
eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends.
Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward.  As they pass sealed doors,
Coffey pounds with a tool, listening.  All flooded.

INT. ENGINE ROOM                                                        70

Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether.  Through
a hatch into the engine room.  Their lights play over flooded machinery.

INT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER                        71

From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack
center.  He pulls at a buckled watertight door.

                                COFFEY
                It's jammed.  Give me a hand.

Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey.  Together they wrench the door open
on its squealing hinges.  It give way suddenly, flying open.  The suction
pulls SOMETHING THROUGH.  It slams Bud's shoulder.  He turns.  A FACE...
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!  He jerks back, gasping.

Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman.  The ensign seems unmarked, merely
dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth.  Coffey
reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way.

                                COFFEY
                Alright, let's keep moving.  We knew we were
                going to see this.

They enter the control room.  Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage.
Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl
in the currents.  A languid, weightless waltz.  They move through the carnage.
Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair,
someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down.  Dead faces, pale in the
lights.  Still.  We see only glimpses.

Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over.  Removes the missile
arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck.  Moves on. All
business.  Bud turns back to his guys.  Checking them.  He notices Jammer is
breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet.  Catfish, Finler, and Sonny
aren't much better.  A wave a panic seems imminent.

                                BUD
                How you guys doing?

                                SONNY
                I'm alright, I'm dealing.

                                CATFISH
                Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It
                ain't.  I'm sorry...

                                BUD
                We're here now.  Let's get her done.

We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it.  He's sweating
rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady.  His projection of calm to the
others is his own salvation.

Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room.

                                COFFEY
                This part I do alone.  Brigman, take you men and
                continue aft.  Split up into two teams of two.
                Let's get moving... we head back in fourteen
                minutes.

Bud leads his team into a narrow corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR/ROOMS                                                     72

They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to
a vertical hatch, open.  a pit of darkness below.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny.  You guys stay on this
                deck.  Hook you line onto mine.  Any problem,
                you tug my line.  Two pulls.  Jammer, you're
                with me.

Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who
barely fits through.  Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a
carabiner and move along the corridor with the others.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE                                                       73

Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing.  Her strobes sear the
darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible
circles it like a bee.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTER                                              74

Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens
it.  He removes several plastic binders... the code books.  He also grabs
handfuls of classified documents and orders, and a set of missile arming keys,
all which he places in a pouch at his waist.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           75

Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping
on the walls and hatches periodically.  After he taps, he waits a few
moments.  There are no answering taps.  They open doors and shine their lights
into the rooms.  The are bodies, but they seem anonymous.  Crumpled shapes
in khaki or blue.  They undog and open a hatch.  Beyond it is the largest
chamber of the sub, the...

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 76

The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long
and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all.  The
chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork.

                                JAMMER
                Where are we?

                                BUD
                Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.

They sweep their lights around the chamber.  Jammer turns... his beam
illuminating a body just beyond the door.  A coveralled seaman turning
slowly in the eddying current.  Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the
man's face.  One scuttles out of his gaping mouth.

                                JAMMER
                Lord Almighty.

                                BUD
                Hey, you okay?

Bud goes to him.  Gets up close to his face.  Sees that he's not.  That he's
hyperventilating.  Fighting nausea.  Bud grabs him by the shoulders.

                                BUD
                Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just
                breathe easy.

                                JAMMER
                I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead.
                I thought... some of them... you know...

                                BUD
                I'm taking you back out.

                                JAMMER
                No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go
                any further in.

Bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized.  He looks at his
watch.  Checker Jammer's pressure gauges.

                                BUD
                Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here.
                I have to go there to the end... you'll see my
                lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold
                onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

                                JAMMER
                Yeah, okay.  Okay.

He moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge
cylinders.  He pays out the lifeline as he goes.

INT. COM-ROOM                                                           77

Coffey is working rapidly and efficiently, moving from one rack of electronics
gear to the next, setting thermite grenades at vital points.  As the thermite
ignites, it generates an intense arc-bright light and tremendous heat.  The
circuit chasses melt.  Coffey works calmly in the infernal glare.

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 78

Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the
missile compartment.  He goes down a stairwell to the lower level.  A HUNDRED
FEET AWAY, Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights.  He starts to get
nervous.  Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM, flickering lower and lower.
They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing.  The darkness
closes in.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  BUD?!  You readin' me?  BUD?!!

BUD, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet
lights, which are dimming and flickering.  He hears nothing from his helmet
transceiver.

JAMMER, smacks the side of his helmet.  Shakes the transceiver on his belt.
Nothing... just static.  Then even the static dies.  Panic time.

He grabs the safety line and pulls twice.  Hard.  It is snagged on a sharp
metal edge ten feet from him.  He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the
thing.  The line severs.  Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward
him.  His eyes bug.  He looks all around in the darkness.  Can't see Bud.
Can't decide what to do.  We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a
flywheel.

Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls.  It is a
cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights.

It grows brighter.  He turns slowly toward it.

The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of
cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  Is that you?

C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source.

Guess what, Jammer?  It's not Bud.  In the brightest center of the glow,
SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls.
Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright
astonishment melting into terror.

The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically.  The shifting shadow falls across
Jammer.  He finally snaps out of his fixity...

Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand
through the treacherous wreckage.

His harness catches on a twisted pipe.

He struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic.

Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength.

He tears free of the entangling debris.  Launches like a torpedo... slamming
his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway.  His tri-mix
regulator takes the full brunt of the impact.

ON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position.  The strange
radiance is gone.  His dive light flare back to full brightness.

                                BUD
                Jammer?  Answer me, buddy,  JAMMER?!

He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place.  A seizure.
Bud grapples with him.

                                BUD
                Hang on, big guy.  Hand on!

Catfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later.  They
leap into the fray.

                                BUD
                He's convulsing!

                                CATFISH
                It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!

Then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with
the valves on his breathing gear.

                                FINLER
                Crank it down, man!  We're gonna losing him...

                                BUD
                SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!

                                SONNY
                You got it?!  You got it?

                                BUD
                Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

Jammer's convulsion ends.  He goes limp.

                                BUD
                We gotta get him out of here.  Come on!
                           (to Jammer)
                Hang on, buddy.

They drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly
back along the lifeline.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE & MONTANA SAIL                                        79

Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane.  Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power.

Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING
appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her!  It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse.  What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid,
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some
hallucinatory jet engine.  And it's hauling ass.

Lindsey jinks left.  The object jogs right.  She fights the control as her
sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.  K-BAM!  Her power comes
back up.  Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.  It pulls a high-G turn
and dives straight down.

We see the object zip behind Flatbed.  One Night can't see it.  The thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.

HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.  Her hands are shaking.  Suddenly
Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.

                                BUD (V.O.)
                CAB ONE!  CAB ONE!  Meet me at Flatbed!  This
                is a diver emergency!!  Do you copy?  Lindsey?!

She has a hard time focusing on what he's saying.  Finally...

                                LINDSEY
                Copy you, Bud.  On my way.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE INFIRMARY -- AN HOUR LATER                                80

Jammer is unconscious on a folding cot set up in the tiny cubicle of the
infirmary.  Monk, who is cross-trained as a medic as well as a demolitions
man, has hung an IV of something.  Bud and the SEAL are in the room, the
others hovering outside.

                                BUD
                Whattya think?

                                MONK
                I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching
                holes.  This type of thing... there's not much
                I can do.  The coma could last hours or days.

Bud, torn by guilt, gazes at the big man lying pathetically on the cot.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CONSOLE MODULE                                                     81

The SEALs, minus Monk, are all gathered inside, debriefing with DeMarco via
closed-circuit video.

                                DEMARCO (video)
                Did any of you see it?

                                COFFEY
                Negative.  But there was definitely a Russian
                bogey.  The Brigman woman saw it.

                                DEMARCO
                CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.  Two Russian
                attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked
                within fifty miles of here... and now we don't
                know what the hell they are.  Okay, I don't have
                any choice.  I'm confirming you to go to Phase
                Two.

Wilhite and Schoenick glance uneasily at each other.

Coffey is silent.  He is vibrating with tension... his fists clenched to
prevent the shaking.  He is wrestling with the moment, knowing it is, in a
way, a point of no return.

                                DEMARCO
                Is there any problem?

                                COFFEY
                Yes... I mean no.  Negative, sir.

Coffey takes a deep breath.  Lets it out.  Phase Two is clearly a big deal.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B/DARKROOM                                         82

The maintenance room doubles as a camera workstation.  An adjoining head serves
as darkroom.  Lindsey is glumly reassembling Cab One's camera housings.

                                BUD
                Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or
                anything?

                                LINDSEY
                No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk
                about it.

                                BUD
                Fine.  Be that way.

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to
                call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a
                Russian submersible.  No problem.

                                BUD
                But you think it's something else.  What?  One
                of ours?

                                LINDSEY
                No.

                                BUD
                Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...

Lindsey is wrestling with a feeling which is somehow also certain knowledge.

                                LINDSEY
                Jammer saw something in there, something that
                scared the hell out him--

                                BUD
                His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and
                pranged his regulator.

                                LINDSEY
                But what did he see that made him panic?

                                BUD
                What do you think he saw?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!

Hippy comes pounding up, sticks his head in, gesturing animatedly.

                                HIPPY
                Hey, you guys... hurry up, check this out!
                They're announcing it.

They follow him into the corridor, trotting down to the mess hall.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          83

General melee as they rush in, everybody focused on the TV.

                Hey, hey!  There's the Explorer.

A LONG LENSE VIDEO SHOT of the Benthic Explorer and the other vessels in a
stormy sea CUTS TO a shot of BILL TYLER, the on-scene reporter, in rain
gear, clutching his microphone.  He is on the deck of a Navy support ship,
being used as a staging area from the press, well away from the center of the
operation.

                                TYLER
                --there is a tremendous amount of activity.
                With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup
                of US ships and aircraft in the area has drawn
                official protest from Havana and Moscow and has
                led to a redirection of Soviet warships into the
                Caribbean theater.

                                ANCHORMAN
                How would you describe the mood there?

                                TYLER
                The mood is one of suspicion, even confrontation.
                A number of Russian and Cuban trawlers,
                undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been
                circling within a few miles throughout the day,
                and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned
                away from the area...

Bud, Lindsey, and Hippy walking along the corridor, Hippy in a black mood of
incipient paranoia.

                                BUD
                What's the matter with you?

                                HIPPY
                Now we're right in the middle of this big-time
                international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile
                Crisis or something.

                                LINDSEY
                Figured that out for yourself, did you?

                                HIPPY
                We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit!

                No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us
                diddly.  Something's going on.

                Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

                Everything is.

One Night is pounding down the corridor from the sub bay.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Hurry up!  Coffey's splitting with Flatbed! He
                got me to show him the controls, then his guys
                suited up and they're rolling.

Bud breaks into a run, passing her.

                                BUD
                Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?

                                ONE NIGHT

Bud clears the door in time to see an empty moonpool, roiling with turbulence.
He runs to the edge and looks down.  Flatbed is a vague shape moving off.

                Unbelievable.

The sky is charcoal, the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes.  Waves
thunder over the foredeck, whipped by eighty-know winds.  Men in life
jackets scurry like insects.  Off the port bow, the ASW destroyer ALBANY
vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall.  McBride scream orders
that can't be heard to the crewmen on deck.  He staggers back along the bridge
railing.

McBride steps into the quiet of the control room.  He turns on De Marco.

                                MCBRIDE
                We're trying to get unhooked and get out of

                kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours!

De Marco's expression is infuriatingly calm... icy.  McBride looks at his
watch and swears under his breath.

For a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated
by diver's lights.  Tiny figures, the divers move like moths around a distant
streetlight.  Wilhite, Monk and Schoenick are clustered around an open missile
hatch.  Using a large lift bag, they are removing the frangible fiberglass,
or 'diaphragm'.  Coffey pilots Flatbed with increasing deftness, deploying
the big arm to aid in the work.

DOWN ANGLE as the diaphragm lifts away... revealing the blunt nose of the
TRIDENT C-4 MISSLE.  Like looking down the barrel of a gun at the bullet
aimed right at you.

It is now clear what the SEALs are doing.  Using large lift bags and Flatbed's
big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident C-4 missiles partway out of its
launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing
several of the MIRV warheads within.

Moving very carefully, Wilhite and Schoenick ease one of the individual MIRVs
out of its bracket.  Hanging under a lift-bag in a jerry-rigged harness, the
three-foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of Flatbed.

Flatbed surfaces in boiling foam.  The rig crew are all waiting.  Like a
crack pit-crew Bud's people leap onto Flatbed while its deck is still awash
and start to work on to Navy divers, unsealing their helmets and uncoupling
their umbilicals.  Hippy and Bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped
in one of the SEAL's gear bags.  Coffey emerges from the hatch.

                                COFFEY

The two SEALs unlash the object in the black bag.  Bud an Lindsey exchange a

climbs the hatch-tower and drops in.  Bud swings the heavy hatch up,
balancing it, and grins down at One Night.

The winch man staggers along the railing, blasted by 80-knot winds.  He
sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical

The umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above, draping
itself over the habitat in large coils.  One Night pilots her submersible

Everyone hold their breath as the sonar return-pings get closer... and
closer.  And closer...

An ENORMOUS SHAPE plunged into the floodlight in front of the rig.

K-WHAM!!  The 40-ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them.
A clean miss.  Much WHOOPING AND CHEERING.  Then...

The crane topples slowly over the back.  It rolls down the slope of the drop-
off, gathering speed.  Then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon.
The coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon.
And they're still attached.

Bud sprints from Control, bouncing off the corridor walls as the rig
lurches and tilts.  The lights go out.  Emergency light come on.  He trips

IN THE LADDERWELL of trimodule C, Lindsey runs toward the machine rooms.
K-BOOM!  A searing bright EXPLOSION in the electrical room.  Flames roar

the electrical room, driving the back with the heat.  A reservoir-tanks
breaks loose from one of the compressor assemblies.  In rolls at him,
crushing his legs against machinery.  The fire roars into the room.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            114

Hippy runs in.  The place is going nuts.  Water floods from the moonpool as
the rig tilts.  Wilhite is dancing across the deck, leaping over compressed-
gas cylinders which are rolling around loose.  Cab One jumps clear off its
cradle and slides SCREECHING across the deck.  Wilhite, running before the
12-tom juggernaut, had no place to go.  The SEAL dives into the churning
moonpool.  Cab One slams into the end wall, then spins and rolls toward
Hippy.

He starts to run.  Drop something.  Looks back.

Beany, in his zip-loc bag, is lying in the path of the slide submersible.
Hippy runs back.  Scoops up the baggie.  Cab One FILLS FRAME behind him.
He makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him,
buckling the steel doorframe.

Wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool.  He gets his fingers
over the top.  Pulls himself up...

A steel helium tank slams against his fingers, crushing them, and he falls
back.  More tanks bounce over the lip of the pool, hammering Wilhite down
into the foaming water.

He doesn't surface.

The rig is sliding to the edge of the cliff.  Beyond it... the bottomless
pit of the Cayman Trough.  It slams, crushing and twisting, into a rock
outcropping and stops, hanging over the precipice.

INT. TRIMODULE A/QUARTERS                                                116

Perry is trapped as the trimodule floods with stunning swiftness.  He makes
it through an emergency hatch between floors but can't get it closed.  The
inrushing tide blasts it open.  He scramble upward to the next hatch.  Spins
the wheel.  No time.  He is slammed against the ceiling by the force of the
water.

Lew Finler, Tommy Ray Dietz, and Lupton McWhirter fight their way toward the
door as the drill room floods rapidly.  Ahead, the big automated watertight
door is closing like a motorized bank-vault.  They reach it just as it is
closing, but can't prevail against the strength of the motors.  FROM THE FAR
SIDE, we can see them screaming soundlessly at the tiny pressure window in
the door.  We can hear the dull THUNK of their pounding.

INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL AND COMPRESSOR ROOM                         117

Coffey and Schoenick, in emergency breathing masks, are fighting the fire with
a seawater hose and fire extinguishers.  Smoke and steam choke the dark
chambers.

Nearby, Lindsey grabs Hippy's arm as he is running past and drags him into the
blazing compressor room.  Hands him her seawater hose.  Wide-eyes, he starts
blasting everything in sight with water.

                                LINDSEY
                No! Hold it on me!

She rushed into the teeth of the fire as Hippy blasts her with a spray of
water, following her into the intense heat.  She grabs Monk, who is
semiconscious, and drags him out of the blazing room... Hippy dancing back
with the hose, tripping, blasting her in the face.

But it works.  They get Monk clear.

INT. DRILL ROOM CORRIDOR                                                118

Bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the
drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the
trapped men.  He claws futility at the door.  The motors and the fail-safe
latching mechanism are on the opposite side.  Through the pressure window he
watches helplessly as they drown.  We don't see what he sees, but we know
what he sees.  Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing
torrent thunders in.  Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor.

He scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the
corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably.  He's
not going to make it.  He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through.
Grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with
the strength of this arms.  It doesn't work.  The steel door closes on the
fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.

But something amazing happens.  His wedding ring lodges between the door and
frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from
sealing and locking.

It resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing.

The freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear.

                                BUD
                Heeyy!!  HHHEEEYYY!!

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, Catfish and Sonny come pounding up.  They see
his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door.  Sonny wedges
a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry.  Catfish whips open his
jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator.  He is
sprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood.

Together they force open the door.  Bud is blown through in a torture of
water.  Sonny is thrown back into some pipes.  Breaks his arm.

Together they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow.
Catfish hammers the fail-safe latch home with the crowbar.

Bud lies gasping and shivering... staring at the tiny band of metal that
saved him.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/ONE HOUR LATER                                            A118

LOOKING DOWN THE WALL of the canyon as Big Geek moves beneath us, tilting up
to show Deepcore perched at the very edge of the abyss.  The rig is twisted
and dented, covered with loops of umbilical, trimodule-A a mass of wreckage.
The ROV passes across the front of the control module.  Through the front
port, two figures can be seen in the light of a single emergency lamp.

                                SONNY (V.O. static)
                Mayday, mayday.  This is Deepcore Two calling

                Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read,
                over?  This is Deepcore--

                Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.

Bud walks down the corridor from control, slowly... as if carrying a great
weight.  The air is still thick with smoke.  The power off... everything
lit by emergency lights.  Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess
hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the
storage room across the hall.  Jammer is still unconscious.  Coffey and
Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table.  He is
conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted.

                                BUD
                Did you find Wilhite?

                                COFFEY
                No.

He and Bud lock eyes.  Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze
blames Coffey.  He turns away.

                                COFFEY
                Brigman.
                              (Bud turns)
                I was under orders.  I had no choice.

Coffey's manner is subdued, contrite.  A marked contrast to his previous
brusque arrogance.  He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the
tight brotherhood of a SEAL unit.  Bud's anger is not dispelled.  But he
can't address it now.  He moves on.

PAST THE INFIRMARY, where Sonny Dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken
arm.  He cries out in pain, cursing at himself.  LOOKING DOWN THE CENTRAL WELL
as Bud crosses.  Down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level
of the module is flooded.  Catfish is down there welding, sending shivering
reflections through the chamber.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       120

Lindsey is working, up to her knees in water.  She is covered with grease,
tools scattered around.  Bud puts his hand on her shoulder.  She looks up,
blows some hair out of her eyes.

                                BUD
                What's the scoop, ace?

                                LINDSEY
                I can get power to this module and sub-bay if
                I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the
                mains, which are a total melt-down.

Rather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected
her in a different way.  She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done,
and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic.

                                BUD
                Need some help?

                                LINDSEY
                Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there
                won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple
                hours this place is going to be as cold as a
                meat locker.

                                BUD
                What about O-2?

                                LINDSEY
                Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth
                if we close off the sections we're not using.

                                BUD
                The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.

                                LINDSEY
                I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks
                outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go
                outside to tie onto them.

She goes back to her task, working efficiently with a socket wrench.

                                BUD
                Hey, Lins...
                          (she looks up)
                I'm glad your here.

                Yeah?  Well I'm not.

The sub bay is still a mess.  Dark.  A few battery-operated lamps.  Flatbed
is back, floating in the moonpool.

One Night and Hippy are in deep concentration, piloting the two ROVs in a
damage survey of the rig.  Bud comes up behind them, check her screen first.
BIG GEEK'S MONITOR shows a view of the aft section of the rig.  The drilling
derrick had collapsed across Cab Three, totaling it.  A girder is jammed
through its acrylic front dome.

scan the flooded interior.

Lying on the deck, almost looking like he's asleep.

                Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get

Catfish and Lindsey, in suits and helmets, drop down from the glare of the
moonpool onto the dark sea floor under the rig.  Walking, they pull their
umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage.  Little
Geek follows along like a dog at their heels.  They settle beside a valve
assembly at the base of the wrecked module.

                                LINDSEY
                Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some
                tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check
                them out.

                You watch yourself.

He begins to attach one end of a coiled-up high-pressure hose to a manifold.
She takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness.  Little
Geek goes with her faithfully.

Cab One is hanging from the overhead crane while One Nigh works to repair it.
Bud is nearby, tending hose for the divers and handing her tools.  Talking
while they work.  Hippy is across the moonpool running Little Geek.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.
                           (he hands it to her)

                There we were, side by side, on the same ship,
                for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're
                testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we
                get back on the beach and... we're living
                together.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

                                BUD
                We were due to go back out on the same ship.
                Six months of tests.  If you were married you
                got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.

                It was alright for a while, you know.  But then
                she got promoted to project engineer on this
                thing, couple years ago.

                                ONE NIGHT
                She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for

                Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive--
                Son of a--!!

He's jammed his fingers with a wrench torquing down a bolt.  Whips his hand
out.

                                BUD
                She didn't leave me... she just left me behind.

She puts her arm around his shoulders, somehow managing to be fraternal,
maternal and suggestive all at the same time.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Bud, let me tell you something.  She ain't half
                as smart as she thinks she is.

She smiles and pretends to kink Lindsey's air-hose.

ACROSS THE CHAMBER, Hippy scowls as Little Geek's screen starts to go haywire
with interference.

Catfish is working on one side of the wrecked module while Lindsey is on the
other, out of sight.  She is standing on the bottom at the base of the
wreckage, checking valves on a rack of oxygen bottles amongst the wreckage.
Right at the edge of the canyon wall.  Behind her is a sheer drop to
nothingness

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah, Hippy, I read you.  What's the matter?

The reply is GARBLED by a wash of static.  Then, for no apparent reason,
Lindsey's helmet light begins to dim out.  Little Geek's lights fade.  His
motors whine to a stop.

ON CATFISH, as his lights drop to candleglows.

The emergency lights are dimming, like a brownout.  Bud grabs the diver
intercom mike.

ON LINDSEY, as she fiddles with her lights and transceiver pack.

                                LINDSEY
                Catfish... I got a problem here.  You there?
                Catfish?

Behind her, SOMETHING rises from the depths.

It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck.

It comes right up behind her.  She doesn't know it's there.  It hovers
sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look.  She
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her.  She turns
slowly.  We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate.

A more powerful glow washes up onto her from below.

Her eyes go down.  She gasps, absolutely stunned...

Above the edge of the wall, AN ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES SILENTLY OUT OF THE
DEPTHS.  Over sixty feet across.  It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.

Lindsey stand before it, unable to move.  Absolutely rapt.

Captivated by its ethereal beauty.  It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her.  She reaches up.  Touches it
as it passes over her.

Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.

The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.  She
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.

About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos.

She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and...

WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.  She pivots, trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a
meteor.  CLICK.  She get a shot a second before it disappears.

From around the flank of the rig module, Catfish appears.  Their com-sets
come backs to life, along with their lights.

                                LINDSEY
                You better not say you missed that.

                                CATFISH
                Missed what?

INT. DEEPCORE/MESS HALL                                                 129

TIGHT ON SLIDE STRIP.  Lindsey's fingertip in for scale.  The shot is black
with a little squiggle of light in the center.  Pathetic.

                                BUD
                Nice shot, Lins.

                                SONNY
                What is that?  You drop your dive light?

WIDER, SHOWING THE GROUP huddled around Lindsey who has her freshly-processed
slide roll laid out on the pinball machine, using it as a light table.

                                LINDSEY
                Come on, you guys... look, this is the little
                one right here.  You can see how it's kind of
                zigging around.

                                BUD
                If you say so.  It could be anything.

                                LINDSEY
                I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not
                hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting
                from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something
                down there.  Something not... us.

She looks around.  Sees a lot of skepticism in the eyes around her.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all could be more specific.

                                LINDSEY
                Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non-
                human, but intelligent...

                                HIPPY
                You mean like Coffey?

Lindsey is reddening.  Despite her conviction, this is really hard.

                                LINDSEY
                A non-terrestrial intelligence.

                                HIPPY
                Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I
                like that better then UFOs.  Although that
                works too... Underwater Flying Objects.

Hippy is not really mocking her.  He's actually into it.  But it has that
effect.  Catfish is eyeing Lindsey like he's never seen her before.

                                CATFISH
                Are we talkin' little space friend here?

                                HIPPY
                Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins?
                Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has
                known about them for years.  They abduct people
                all the time.  There was this woman I knew in
                Albuquerque who--

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side.

Bud takes her firmly by the arm.  Heads her out into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, will you step into my office for a
                minute...

INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER WELL                                               130

He propels her along the corridor, away from the mess hall doorway.  They
face each other in the narrow space.

                                BUD
                Jesus, Lindsey--

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, something really important is happening
                here.

                                BUD
                Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation
                together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind
                of hysteria--

                                LINDSEY
                Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

They're talking across each other, not connecting.  Bud weary and frustrated.
Lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter.

                                BUD
                All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your
                fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.

                                LINDSEY
                I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there
                and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.

                                BUD
                God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.

                                LINDSEY
                I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do
                I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of
                pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?

                                BUD
                No.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me
                better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my
                lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of
                them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like
                we would build... it glided.  It was the most
                beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Bud is stilled by her intensity.  She moves close to him.  Eyes alive and
luminous.

                                LINDSEY
                It was a machine, but it seems almost alive.
                Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to
                trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us
                harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a
                feeling.

                                BUD
                How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's
                going to go on you 'feeling'?

                                LINDSEY
                We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks
                and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear.
                Bud, you have to look with better eyes than
                that.

Bud has been taking this all in.  His eyes tracking her face.  He closes his
eyes, taking a deep breath.  It's so hard for him to do this, but...

                                BUD
                I can't, Lindsey.  I'm sorry.  How can I?

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MESS HALL -- LATER                                                 131

Coffey has Bud, Lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little
summit.  Lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self-imposed
exile.  They're all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves.  Their
breath shows in the air.

                                COFFEY
                I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar
                shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early
                warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.

                                LINDSEY
                          (rolling her eyes)
                Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three
                and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal
                trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking
                Russian.

Coffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke.

                                COFFEY
                            (to One Night)
                Why haven't you finished repairs on the
                hydrophone transmitter yet?

                                ONE NIGHT
                I was having my nails done.

Coffey is sweating, despite the chill.  Keeps his hands clenched in fists so
they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten.

                                COFFEY
                Get something straight.  You people are under my
                authority--

                                CATFISH
                Look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't
                take orders from you, and we don't much like you.
                In addition to which your momma dresses you
                funny.

Coffey's eyes are straight razors.  He slashes them from face to face.  You
can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation
in front of his own men.  Bud defuses it.

                                BUD
                'Fish'?

                                CATFISH
                Yuh?

                                BUD
                Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you
                handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see
                if you can get that transmitter working for me,
                okay?

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a couple of hours.

HOLD ON COFFEY as everyone leaves.  Winding tighter.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B -- LATER                                        132

Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead.  They have a small port
removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an ELECTRONIC DETONATOR.  The
black box Lindsey glimpsed earlier.  As the two SEALs work like surgeons, we
see past Coffey's shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him, which looks
out into the perpetual blackness.  Something appears... a goofy shark face.

Big Geek rises silently in front of the port.  It moves a little, trying to
get a peek over Coffey's shoulder.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK                                           133

Hippy is twiddling his joysticks, watching the screen like a ferret.

                                HIPPY
                Come on... move to the left... just a little
                more... come on, A.J. Squared Away... that's
                it--

ON THE SCREEN, Geek's POV.  Coffey is blocking Hippy's view of whatever it is
they're working on.  Abruptly, be moves.  The warhead is lying there in plain
sight, detonator wires hooked up.  Hippy's eyes bug out.  He knows exactly
what it is.

                                HIPPY
                Pretty radical, guys.  Pretty radical.

He hurries to the VCR and puts it into RECORD.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK -- MINUTES LATER                          134

Video image of the SEALs working.  It FREEZES on a clear view of the warhead.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Say hello to MIRV.

Bud has his face right up to screen.  He frowns, skeptical.

                                HIPPY
                Come on, man.  What else could it be?

                                BUD
                Why bring it here?

                                HIPPY
                It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep
                it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the
                nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in
                the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot.
                Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

Bud whips around.  Lindsey, standing quietly in the doorway.  It's apparent
from expression she's been watching them for some time.  She looks ready to
kill somebody.  Then she's gone.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           135

Bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about
                it, I will.

                                BUD
                Lindsey!  Wait a second--

She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room B.  It's locked.  Before
Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-extinguisher off the wall and pounds on
the steel door like a big gong.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!

Needless to say, it opens.  She pushes past Schoenick, see the bomb lying
there naked.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got some huevos bringing this...
                thing... into my rig!  With everything that's
                been going on up in the world, you bring a
                nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone
                as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

                                COFFEY
                You don't need to know the details of this
                mission... you're better off if you don't.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right... I don't.  I just need to know
                that this thing is out of here!  You hear me,
                Roger Ramjet?

                                COFFEY
                Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment
                to this mission.  I believe the stress is
                affecting you.
                            (to Schoenick)
                Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a
                tranquilizer.

Schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip.

                                LINDSEY
                Bullshit, you can't do that.  Oww... goddamnit!

Lindsey goes bananas, trying to get Schoenick's big hands off her arms.  Bud
slams his hand down on the intercom button.

                                BUD
                Emergency!  Maintenance room B.  Emergency!

He pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on Coffey... warning him
with a look that is not to be messed with.  Coffey is braced back against the
worktable... an odd stance, with one arm behind his back.  Suddenly there's
a crowd outside the door as Catfish, Hippy, One Night, and Sonny come running
up.  Confrontation time.

Sirens going.  About a million volts of electricity in the air.  Bud braces
Schoenick.

                                BUD
                Let her go.  Do it... right now.

He does.  Lindsey jerks away.  Rubs her arms.

                                LINDSEY
                You dumb jarhead motherf--

                                BUD
                Chill out, Lindsey!!

                                CATFISH
                What's the problem?

Everyone is frozen in place.  Bud a Coffey... snake and mongoose, glaring.
Bud pulls Lindsey back into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  We were just leaving.
                              (to her)
                Weren't we?

ANGLE FROM BEHIND COFFEY, as Bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor.
Hands behind his back.  In his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the
.45.  He turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind.
he seems to sag.  When he looks at Schoenick, his eyes are wounds.  A hunted
animal.  Voice shaky.

                                COFFEY
                They can't be trusted.  They're turning against
                us.  We may have to take... steps.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           136

Lindsey, Bud, Hippy.  Bud slows, letting them trail behind the others.

                                BUD
                Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his
                hands?

                                LINDSEY
                He's got the shakes?

                                BUD
                Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off
                from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms
                of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a
                nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me...
                will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?

                                HIPPY
                Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about
                nine point five.

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                                 137

Coffey goes to the dome port.  Looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection
into the void.  Eternal night.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE.  Coffey's face in the window.  Stuck to the acrylic
bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws.  Coffey
stares out.  Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on,
spreadeagle and screaming.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY/DIVE-PREP AREA                                             138

Under a single worklight, a couple of conspirators.  Lindsey and Hippy hunch
over Big Geek.  The ROV grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, you can just punch into his little chip
                where you want him to go, and he goes, right?

                                HIPPY
                Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna
                be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just
                sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders
                through view of the camera, you'll get nada.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                      139

ONE SURVEILLANCE MONITOR.  Lindsey and Hippy next to Big Geek.  Their voices
are tinny but intelligible.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I don't know.  I really oughta talk to Bud about
                this.

E.C.U. COFFEY.  Watching them in the dark.  Alone.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then
                tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to
                Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off
                the button a little.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more
                than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away
                goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple
                hours on this.

Coffey watches, his jaw clenched.

INT. QUARTERS/MESS HALL                                                 140

The lights are down.  Those who can are grabbing some sleep.  Snoring comes
from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes.  In the mess hall, Catfish and
Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets.  The cold has gotten
intense.  Water drips.  The walls sweat with condensation.  Lindsey can see
her breath as she makes coffee.  She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a
face in a pile of blankets.  A hand comes out, takes the coffee.

                                MONK
                Thanks.

Lindsey sips hers, staring.  Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless
pit.  She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping.  His soft
snoring downshifts into a loud rasp.  Lindsey touches him gently on the
shoulder.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, turn on your side.

Bud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response.  The snoring
stops.  It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two
have logged together.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        141

Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens.  Too comfortable.
He's asleep, chin on his chest.  On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost
imperceptibly faint trace appears.  A HUM, which is by now familiar, becomes
audible.  Sonny shifts in his seat.  Doesn't wake.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            142

Hippy puts his tools away, finished with the modifications to Big Geek.

                                HIPPY
                All set, big guy.  Hey, I told you to wipe that
                grin off your face.

He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door.  Switches off
the lights.  Goes out.

Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then...

A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending
shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to
pulsate.

Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering
pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an
amoebic mass shivering in the air.

It stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass
python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends,
stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip,
a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward,
as if it can see where it's going.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           143

Hippy trudges along the dark corridor.  He reaches the men's head and goes in.
As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor
B.G.  It 'looks' left and right.  Then extends the length of the corridor,
holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.

INT. TRIMODULE B/LADDERWELL/BUNKROOM/MESS HALL                          144

LOOKING DOWN three levels through the central ladderwell between the
cylinders.  The pseudopod enters and undulates upward.

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside.

Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious.  Jammer is still unconscious.  The
pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.

IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle
enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching.
It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying
everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head,
turning... sees the apparition next to her.

Her eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still
searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.

Bud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging
open like a total goon.

Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.

Catfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open
now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to
recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her.  She holds her ground, fascinated.

The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water,
still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise.
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression.
Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a
face, sticking out her tongue... testing it.

The liquid-Lindsey does the same.  Bud has just had the rug jerked out from
under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty
will, considering.

                                BUD
                            (whispering)
                I think it likes you.

                                LINDSEY
                It's trying to communicate.

Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's.

She reaches out her hand slowly.  Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface.
Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.

Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's
dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.  She draws her wet
fingers out and studies them, amazed.  Touches one fingertip to her tongue.

                                LINDSEY
                Seawater.

The pseudopod pulls back from her.  It loops in the air dramatically, full
circle... and ties itself into a knot.  As the knot tightens down, it melts
back into the body.  The 'disappearing knot' trick.

Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a
magic show.  She is transported.

                                LINDSEY
                Show off.

She looks at Bud.  He grins broadly.  He's with her now.

The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room.  Out to the
corridor

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            145

Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area.  They see
the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk.  Coffey's mind is
blown.  We can smell the insulation burning.  He just stares.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        146

The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead.  It studies
the device for a few seconds.  Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in
time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead.  They begin to lift it off its cart.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            147

Coffey finally jump-starts his brain.  In a flash of insight, he runs to the
big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor.  He
and Schoenick heave on the door.  Like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it.

VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the
body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor.  It reverts to
nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve,
the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.  ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE
DOOR, however, the "stump" rears back like a cobra.  It withdraws rapidly into
the moonpool.  The glow fades away.

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        148

Sonny wakes up with a start as the HUM revs up into a LOUD WHINE and then
fades away.  He scrambles to track it.  Too late.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           149

Hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the
length of the corridor.  He missed the whole thing.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          150

Light on.  Everybody there.  Lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now
that she's been proven right.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a
                Russian water-tentacle.  Lieutenant?  No?  Well,
                a breakthrough.

Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in "The Shining".
Bud give her a warning look.  Don't poke at the rattler.

                                BUD
                You done impressing yourself, ace?

                                ONE NIGHT
                No way that could just be seawater.

                                LINDSEY
                They must've learned how to control water... I
                mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize
                it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under
                intelligent control.

                                BUD
                Maybe their whole technology is based on that.
                Controlling water.

Coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees.  His hands are out of sight.  His
arm is moving in a slow rhythm.  We can't see what he's doing.

                                HIPPY
                That thing was probably their version of Big
                Geek... like an ROV.

                                CATFISH
                Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE, showing what Coffey is doing.  He has his K-BAR KNIFE
gripped white-knuckle in one hand.  He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly
across the skin of the other forearm.  Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to
elbow.

C.U. COFFEY -- He doesn't flinch.  His eyes are hard and bright as diamond
drills.  No one notices.  He's keeping the edge.

                                LINDSEY
                They're curious, maybe.  We could be the first
                people they've seen up close.

                                SONNY
                Hope they don't judge the whole race offa us.

                                CATFISH
                Maybe I oughta shave.

Coffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking
through the group as if they were smoke.  This cold behavior brings the mood
down a notch.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        151

Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume.
Bright speculation, a few jokes.  Coffey is visible shaking.  Breathing hard.
Pupils dilated.  Schoenick looks at him with concern.

                                COFFEY
                It went straight for the warhead.  And they
                think it's cute.

                                SCHOENICK
                You need to get some sleep.

Coffey walks away without hearing him.  Schoenick catches up.

INT. MAINTENANCE                                                        152

The door opens in the dark room.  Coffey enters, moving with purpose.  He
pulls his gear bag out from under the work table.  Unzips it.  Pulls out a
short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle.

                                COFFEY
                We have no way of warning the surface.  Do you
                know what that means?

Schoenick doesn't know.  He hopes Coffey knows.  Because he's a fearless man
who's discovering what it is to be afraid.  Coffey inserts the magazine with
a CLACK!  Snaps the bolt.  Tosses the rifle to Schoenick.

                                COFFEY
                It means... whatever happens is up to us.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE -- LATER                                      153

Hippy passes the maintenance room.  Looks in.  The warhead and its cart are
missing.  He looks around.  Heads toward the sub-bay.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          154

The discussion, still in progress.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You think they're from down there originally?
                Or from... you know.

She jerks her thumb toward the ceiling.

                                LINDSEY
                I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place
                that has similar conditions... cold, intense
                pressure.  No light.

                                CATFISH
                Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.

INT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY                                                   155

Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from
the sub-bay.  He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the
steel floor.  Slides up along the wall next to the door.  Inches his eye
around the doorframe.  Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall,
lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart.  He
begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps.

Hippy lets his breath out slowly.  His expression is Holy Shit.

He slides back along the corridor wall, silently.  Away from the door.  Then
turn turns quickly to go... WHAM!  Coffey slams him up against the wall!
.45 pressed to Hippy's temple.  Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the
hammer.

                                COFFEY
                Sniff something did you, rat boy?

INT. MESS HALL                                                          156

The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted
inside.  His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face.
Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45.  Schoenick flanks him
with the assault rifle aimed at the group.

                                COFFEY
                FREEZE!  Don't move.  That's it.
                              (to Monk)
                Here, hold this a second.  We're going to phase
                three.

He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team
member.  Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol.  We can't tell what
he's thinking.  Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair.

                                HIPPY
                They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the
                NTIs!  We set it up to go right to them.

Lindsey looks stricken.  Her plan is betraying them all.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh my God...  Oh no...
                        (steps toward Coffey)
                Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what
                you're doing... for God's sake--

Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering.

Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke
machine, pinning her there with one hand.  Bud leaps forward.

                                SCHOENICK
                GET BACK!

Bud freezes.  The rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot.

Coffey moves up close to Lindsey.

                                COFFEY
                This is something I've wanted to do since I
                first met you.

His hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.  We hear something RIP.  His hand comes
back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape.

He slaps it over her mouth.  Then pushes her down into a chair.

Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick.

                                HIPPY
                You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's
                fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and
                we're all ringside!

                                MONK
                What's the timer set for?

                                SCHOENICK
                Three hours.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  Don't talk!

                                MONK
                We can't get to minimum-safe-distance in three
                hours.  The shockwave will kill us.  It'll crush
                this rig like a semi driving over a beer can.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  SHUT UP!  What's the matter with you?!

Everybody is twitching a hyper.  Schoenick is white-knuckling his assault
rifle... looking from Monk to Coffey to the group.

                                COFFEY
                Just stay calm.  The situation is under control.

Coffey backs out quickly with Schoenick.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           157

Coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into
the mechanism so it can't be opened.

                                COFFEY
                Stay here.

Schoenick take a position in front of the door.  Coffey turns and runs through
the corridor like demons are chasing him.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          158

Their only hope is to sway Schoenick.  But the SEAL's fear is making him the
perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders.  And his orders are
clear.  They can see him through the tiny window in the door.  Lindsey rips
the tape painfully off her mouth.

                                LINDSEY
                Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make
                a real bad career move...

                                HIPPY
                That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

                                BUD
                We have to stop him!  Schoenick!!

They pound on the door.  Schoenick turns and hangs his cap over the tiny
window.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            159

Using the chainfall, Coffey maneuvers the completed Geek/MIRV package over
the back of Flatbed, obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it
out and launch it.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          160

Lindsey is up next to the door, with Bud.

                                LINDSEY
              ... he's about to declare war on an alien species,
                Schoenick, just when they're trying to make
                contact with us.
                                (to Bud)
                I think I'm reaching him.

There is a CLUNK-CLATTER and the door unlatches.

                                LINDSEY
                See?

The door opens.  Jammer is standing there.  Schoenick is in a heap against
the far wall, moaning.  Jammer hands the rifle to Hippy as he walks in.  Hippy
turns to cover the other SEAL.  Monk puts his hands up, passively.

                                MONK
                I'm the least of your problems.

Bud appraises Jammer, who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay.

                                BUD
                Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?

                                JAMMER
                Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that
                angel comin' toward me.

They all look at him for a second.  What?

                                BUD
                Uh, okay, right.  You can tell us about it
                later.  Let's go.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL                                             161

Bud drops down the ladder, INTO FRAME, followed by the others.  He tries the
door into the main corridor.  The wheel won't turn.  The others get on it.
Won't budge.

                                BUD
                He's jammed the mechanism.

                                LINDSEY
                Now what?

They're locked in trimodule-C.  No other doors give access to the sub-bay
corridor.  Bud's mind is racing.  He drops down the ladder to Level One, into
about two feet of water.  He reaches down and open the emergency lockout
hatch.  Takes off his boots.

                                BUD
                Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get
                inside, get the door open from the other side.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above
                freezing.

                                BUD
                Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

Catfish is pulling his boots off as well.

                                CATFISH
                Wish us luck.
                       (hands his wallet to Hippy)
                'Case I don't die.  Okay, Bud... let's go,
                podner, I ain't got all day.

Bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating.  He drops into
the water.

EXT. DEEPCORE/TRIMODULE C                                               162

Bed shoots down through the hatch.  The cold hits him list a fist, becoming
instantly paralyzing.  He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel.
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell.  They reach hatch six.  Together
they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it.

INT.  TRIMODULE D/LEVEL ONE                                             163

Bud surges up into the lock.  Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him.
They try the upper hatch.  Jammed.  They're both panting with the exertion
and intense cold.

                                BUD
                Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.

                                CATFISH
                I can't... make it... podner.

Bud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat.  You head back.

Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           164

Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit.  He sees the
lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            165

In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of
Flatbed.  His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey
uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking
the Geek/MIRV in its gripper.

Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the
water onto the deck of the pool.  He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle.
His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold.  His fingers are
completely numb.  He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits.
Scans the situation.  He can't get to the door, which is across the room,
without Coffey seeing him.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     166

Lindsey watching the whole thing going down, ON THE SCREEN, a high angle of
the sub bay... Bud moving up on Coffey.

                                HIPPY
                He can't get to the door... I think he's going
                to try and take him himself.

                                LINDSEY
                He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained
                killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling
                One Night over laundry duty.

ON THE SCREEN, Bud picks up a piece of pipe.  Hefts it.  Moves forward,
crouched... stalking.  Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration.

                                LINDSEY
                BUUUUUD!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            167

Bud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then
wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees,
taking him down.  Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor
kick that topples him.

Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water.

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself
out, hoping to make it to the door.

Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs.

He pulls himself up as Bud kick out.  Claws his way viciously over Bud's
body until he has him pinned to the deck.  Then he pulls out the .45.

Put it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     168

                                LINDSEY
                NOOO!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            169

Coffey pulls the trigger... CLICK.  Bud flinches, then opens his eyes,
staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the .45.  Coffey cocks it and tries
again.  CLICK.  Nothing.  Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls
the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against
a rack of equipment.  They face off, panting.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     170

The rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monk's voice.

                                MONK
                I tool the liberty of removing this before I
                gave it back to him.

Monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from
the .45.

INT. SUB WAY                                                            171

Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked.  Coffey's really trying to put him out
of business.  It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part.  Throw a few things.
When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard.  Give him credit, though.  He
manages to scramble back up.

The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear.

Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor.

Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks.

Slams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door.

But the Navy man is just too massive.  Bud is hammered back into a wall.
Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace.  Spins around at the
sound of a VOICE.

                                CATFISH
                Hey!

Catfish is right behind him.  Dripping wet.  A trail of water goes back to
the moonpool a few feet away.

CRACK!  Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is
knocked right on his ass.  He doesn't get up.  Just sort of flops around.

Catfish helps Bud to his feet.  They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles
sideways, his eyes rabid.

He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them.  As they duck he sprints to
Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.

                                BUD
                           (to Catfish)
                Get the door!

Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed.  The hatch is already sealed.
He grapples with Geek/MIRV, trying to free it from the steel claw.

INT. FLATBED                                                            172

Coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilot's compartment.  He claws
his way into the control seat and starts rapidly flipping switches.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           173

Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut
doing a rumba.  He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins
the wheel.  Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach.
Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle.  John Wayne.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            174

Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water.  Bud
is being dragged down, still trying to free the ROV.  He gives up when he
sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo.

Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool.

Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his
viewing bubble beneath the swirling water.  Coffey looks up, stares at the
gun... doesn't seem to care.

                                CATFISH
                SHOOT!

Hippy's squeezing the trigger and nothing's happening.  Flatbed's hatch tower
goes under.

                                CATFISH
                Safety's on!  On the side... the lever!  Up,
                push it up!

Hippy fumble with the selective-fire lever, BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  He put three
quick rounds into the ceiling.

                                HIPPY
                SHIT!

                                CATFISH
                Give me that!!

He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub.  He racks the water
with a long burst.  BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails
through the water.  They barely scar the front port.

                                LINDSEY
                Forget that... go for Big Geek!

Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the
shimmering shape of the ROV on its back.  UNDERWATER we see the rounds
arcing wild, a few hitting the ROV but causing little damage.

Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor.  ABOVE, Catfish
empties the weapon.

                                BUD
                Gimme a hand!

They all turn.  Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman.  The others
rush over to help him.

                                BUD
                Get the rest of my gear.  Grab that hat there...
                let's go guys!  Come on, come on!

Catfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and
hose connections.  Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and
buckling all over him.  This is a world-record suit-up time.  Bud pulls the
rubber neck-dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face.

                                BUD
                Helmet... helmet!  Work fast.

EXT. DEEPCORE UNDERSTRUCTURE                                            175

Beneath the habitat, Coffey is maneuvering Flatbed through the twisted pipe
and debris left by Deepcore's slide to the edge.  Bloodied, his fatigues
ripped half-off, he looks like a feral animal.  His eyes burn with the
determination of his mission.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            176

Jammer expertly works the crane controls, moving Cab One out over the
moonpool from its drydock cradle.  Lindsey and One Night are scrambling like
monkeys over the port side crash bars of the swinging sub, clambering up to
the hatch tower.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I'll unhook.
                           (Lindsey hesitates)
                GO!  You're better in these than I am.

Lindsey recognizes this for what it is... a sign of respect, a
reconciliation.  She nods and drops through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           177

Coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes
a tight turn beneath the drill-floor module.  Flatbed scrapes through between
twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            178

Bud has his 'hat' locked down and his air cut on.  He take two quick strides
to the edge of the pool and just drops in.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           179

Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles.  He looks around.  Through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern.  Bud see a shortcut under the platform.

He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-
hand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.

Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing
behind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub.

Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.

LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.
Hovering.

ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.

INT./EXT. FLATBED                                                       180

Coffey works intently.  His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a
face streaked with blood.  He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.

GEEK/ROV had a passenger.  Brigman.  The diver is holding Geek's skid with
one hand, doing something with the other.  He turns to look at Coffey.

EXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE                                                   181

Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the
steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud
kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie
one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending
an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its
load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.

Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is
hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV
strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping
as Bud fights to make a knot.

Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face.

Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.

The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An
enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.

The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud.

Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming.

Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as
Coffey closes the last few feet.

One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside
rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of
pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!!

INT. FLATBED                                                            182

Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port.  He
gets back in the seat.  Strains to free his machine.

EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183

Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in
Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.
It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him.

Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO.
DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon
line starts to play through the knot slowly.

BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to
side, up or down.

Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,
blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full
throttle.

At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible
slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey
looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She
cruises up over Bud.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Get in!

Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       184

Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut.  He ditches his helmet.
Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.  Through the front port
there is not sign of Coffey.

                                LINDSEY
                You owe me one, Virgil.

                                BUD
                Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.

He points.  Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at
its leash.  Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to
open her own small manipulator claws.

EXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.                                                185

The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.

Big Geek happily surges forward.  It dives gracefully down into the void,
trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.

ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.

                                BUD
                Go after it!  We gotta catch it!

FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are
slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full
throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his
more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.

She arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She
fights for control.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       186

Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.  Lindsey flies with her
jaw set.  Fighting hard for control.  The A-frame of the rig looms before her.
She shoots through at full throttle.

EXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN                                         187

Now the fight is really on.  The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical
modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.

Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.

They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.

Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that.

Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.

Lindsey rises, cuts right.

Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in
the rocks.

Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.

It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.

Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's
tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.

INT. FLATBED                                                            188

Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control.

He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge.  As the
pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with
the enormous load.

A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows.
Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit.

The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.

Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes
into him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a
bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.

EXT. CANYON WALL                                                        189

Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.

Soon its lights vanish.

INT. CAB ONE                                                            190

They're both going to have a lot of bruises...

Lindsey is surveying the damage.  Water is spraying down on them like a
shower, and lights are flickering.

                                LINDSEY
                You did okay, back there.  I was fairly
                impressed.

                                BUD
                Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

                                LINDSEY
                Not in this thing.

Lindsey is flipping switches.  Nothing works.

                                BUD
                You totaled it, huh?

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah.  So sue me.

Bud looks down.  There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the
floor at their feet.

                                BUD
                It's flooding like a son of the bitch.

                                LINDSEY
                You noticed.

She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.

She waits.  No response.

                                BUD
                Try again.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance,
                over.  Deepcore, this--

With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything
goes black.

                                LINDSEY
                Well, that's that.

                                BUD
                Wonderful.
                          (looking around)
                There's some light from somewhere...

A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port.
Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                Over there.  It's the rig.

A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the
hill in the desert.

                                BUD
                Good hundred yards, I'd say.

                                LINDSEY
                They'll come out after us.

                                BUD
                Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find
                us.  We better get this flooding stopped.

He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light.  Using the thing like a bulky
flashlight.  The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower...
almost two feet deep already.

                                LINDSEY
                You see where it's coming in?

                                BUD
                Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.

She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by
a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.

                                BUD
                Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off.
                You go any tools?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know, look around.

Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water.  It's past his
knees.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn
                crescent wrench.

He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench
it off the wall.  Heaves on it repeatedly.  Finally stops, panting.  He's
breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch!

                                LINDSEY
                Calm down, Bud.

A nervous edge in her voice now.  Bud's turning all around, looking around
for anything, trying to think fast.  Water up to their waists.  The sea
closing in.

                                BUD
                Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.

                                LINDSEY
                How?

                                BUD
                I don't know how!

                                LINDSEY
                We've only got one suit.

                                BUD
                I know!  I know!  But we better come up with
                something.

                                LINDSEY
                Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling,
keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water.  She's
shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water
pouring in.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back
                with another suit.

                                BUD
                Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough
                time.  Look at this...
                       (the rate of flooding)
                Time I get back you'll be--

That stops the conversation for a second.  About two feet of airspace left.
Bud can't believe what this is coming down to.  They both stare at each other
for a long moment.

He makes a decision.  Starts pulling off his backpack.

                                BUD
                Alright, put this on.

                                LINDSEY
                What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You
                got it on, keep it on.

                                BUD
                Don't argue, goddamnit, just--

                                LINDSEY
                No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

Bud has his pack off uncoupling it.  She keeps fighting his hands, stopping
him, hooking it back up.  The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--

                                LINDSEY
                NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--

                                BUD
                FUCK LOGIC!!

They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests.
Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.

                                LINDSEY
                Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?
                You're for the suit on and you're a better
                swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...

                                BUD
                What's the plan?

                                LINDSEY
                I drown, you tow me back to the rig--

                                BUD
                WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??

Lindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide.  But she's keeping
it together.  Thinking it out.  Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her
and he can barely think.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, this water is only a couple degrees above
                freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia...
                my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived
                after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the
                stuff to do it on the rig.

Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him.  The water is up
to their necks.  He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.

                                BUD
                It is insane.

                                LINDSEY
                It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

She takes a deep breath.  Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his
suit, rehooking everything.

                                BUD
                Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.

She raise his helmet.  Water up to their chins.  They lock eyes, inches
apart.  He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.

                                BUD
                Oh God, Lins... I--

                                LINDSEY
                Tell me later.

He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his.  They lock
together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked
realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.

She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet
over his head.  Seats is down over the neck ring.  Lock the bail-out handle,
sealing it.  Even with her head press up into the highest point of the
ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water.  She give a scared little
laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?

She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.  Puts her face to
the glass of his helmet.  Seconds to go.

                                LINDSEY
                Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...

He can't hear her, but he read her lips.  They clutch each other desperately.
The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose.  She starts
to choke.  Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes.
Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.

                                BUD
                NOOOOO!!!

The freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her
hands float lifelessly.

Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open
mouth.  He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of
the lockout hatch.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE                                            191

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, one of the outside cameras.  A ghostly figure swims out
of the darkness, towing something.

                                ONE NIGHT
                It's Bud.  Oh my God... that's Lindsey!

                                BUD (V.O./faint)
                Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read?

                                HIPPY
                Read you, Bud.  We're here.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           192

Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey.  Her arms and legs float
as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current.  Bud's voice comes in
short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.

                                BUD
                Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...
                de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc
                syringe... and some... heating blankets.
                You got all that?

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Got it. Over.

                                BUD
                Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.

INT. INFIRMARY                                                          193

The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in.  He picks up the CPR cart, meant
to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who
are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment.  They ransack the place in
about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything
else.

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER THE MOONPOOL                                        194

Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving
platform.  Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,
looking down.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            195

Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things,
making mistakes.  One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a
bottle of adrenaline.

                                SONNY
                Here he comes!

Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged
diving platform.  Bud bursts to the surface.  Together they haul Lindsey
across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck.  Her skin is blue-
white, her chest still.

Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a
mission.  The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see
Lindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert.  Water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp.  Hippy peels back one
eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.

But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.

                                BUD
                Turn her over!

They flip his wife's body over.  He straddles her, pushing down with both
hands in the middle of her back.  Seawater gushes from her slack lips.  He
does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.

                                BUD
                Come on, hurry!  Gimme the de-fib...

One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment.  They've
all been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a
friend they're working on.  They're all thumbs.  Catfish drops the electrodes,
picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...

                                CATFISH
                Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare
                skin, or it won't...

Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her
T-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.

                                BUD
                Jesus.  Gimme those, come on.  Catfish, move it,
                man!  Come on... come on!

He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on
the side of the rib cage.

                                BUD
                Is that it?  Is this right?

                                HIPPY
                Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.

                                BUD
                All right.  Do it!

One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses.  It is a pure muscle
reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life.  Hippy pushes him
back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth.  He opens the valve
on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag.  They start packing
electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia

                                BUD
                Do it again, One Night.  Zap her again!

The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches.  Bud doesn't wait for a
result... he's in his own reality now, driven.  He's doing it all at once,
somehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands,
squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.

                                BUD
                Aw.  Christ... come on, baby.  Again!  Do it
                again!

Lindsey's back arches.  Her body relaxes, inert.

                                BUD
                Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?

A hush seems to have fallen over the group.  They know instinctively that it's
over.  But Bud can't accept it.  He looks at them, beseechingly, like they
are somehow intentionally holding out on him.  One Night starts to cry,
quietly.

                                CATFISH
                                (gently)
                Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.

There is a beat of silence.  Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open,
motionless eyes.

TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.

REVERSE, HER POV.  SILENCE.  A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One
Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down.  It is like the circular top of
a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water.  It is
as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing
smaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes
a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a
turned-off TV.

TIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring.  Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder.
Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman,
renewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.

                                BUD
                No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong,
                she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come
                on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do
                it... DO IT!

They do.  And Bud works, feverishly.  He lock his lips over hers and starts
mouth-to-mouth.  It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.

                                BUD
                Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you
                never backed down from anything in life... now
                fight!

He slaps her face, hard.  Her head lolls.  He smacks her the other way.

                                BUD
                Fight, Goddamnit!

LINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well.  The circles of faces and
light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit.  We
see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.

                                BUD
                FIGHT!!

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, still.  Then something incredible happens.  Something they
will never forget as long as they live.  Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her
hands clench in a spasm.

Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific.

                                BUD
                Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your
                way back, baby...

The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.

She starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air
into her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-
establish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking
and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.

Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized
breath.  He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands,
and watches her breathe.  Color is returning to her skin as she lies there,
gasping weakly.

ONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're
all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth.

ON BUD... tears are streaming down his face.

                                BUD
                   (a whisper, fierce and harsh)
                You did it, ace.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/QUARTERS -- LATER                                         196

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully.  WIDER shows Bud hovering over her,
attentive.  They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle.  Perhaps twenty minutes
have passed.  She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face,
and looks like a waif.

Lindsey's eyes flutter and open.  The first thing she sees is Bud, bending
over her.  He can't help himself.  The tears break again and roll down his
cheeks.  She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware.  She smiles,
faintly... touches his cheek.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?

                                BUD
                Hi, lady.

                                LINDSEY
                Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?

                                BUD
                'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you?
                How d'you feel.

                                LINDSEY
                I've been better.  Next time it's your turn,
                okay?

Bud's expression turn inexplicably grim.

                                BUD
                Well, you got that right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            197

TIGHT ON BUD'S EYES, as Monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his
eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet.

WIDER reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit.  Everybody is grouped
around, buckling and zipping.  He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask,
part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing.  Monk,
on his stretcher, is presiding.  The resident expert.  Lindsey is wrapped in a
blanket, still looking wan and frail.  She doesn't have the strength to resist
Bud's will, but she's trying.

                                LINDSEY
                No, Bud, no... not you.

                                BUD
                Who then?

She looks around at the others.  Sees their eyes.  The fear.  Has her answer.
He lowers the helmet over his head.  Catfish clamps it down.  We see what's
driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being
able to prevent this situation.

He touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling.
Then he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's
forearm.  Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.

                                BUD (muffled)
                So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?

                                MONK
                The fluid prevents your larynx from making
                sound.  It'll feel a little strange.

                                BUD (muffled)
                Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.
                              (a beat)
                The moment of truth, huh?

His breathing is shallow and tense.  He looks at Lindsey.  The eyes of a
condemned man.  She squeezes his hand.  He takes a deep breath.

                                BUD
                Okay.  Let's rock and roll.

Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line.  The breathing fluid (3M
fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet.  Bud reflexively raises
his chin.  The liquid fills toward his mouth.

                                MONK
                Relax now, Bud.  Just keep breathing as it
                fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let
                yourself take it in.

Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.  His eyes go wide,
instant panic.  He starts to thrash.  Chest heaving.

                                MONK
                Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll
                pass in a second.  You're gonna be okay.  We all
                breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body
                will remember.

Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him.  He finds her eyes, the look
calming him.  He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.
His spasms subside.  He begins to "breathe" normally.  He gets a goofy look
of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is
alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins.
Gives a big thumbs up.  Lindsey picks up a microphone.

                                LINDSEY
                Can you hear me okay?
                          (another thumbs up)
                Try your keypad.

Bud taps out a brief message.  FEELS WEIRD - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS prints out
on their portable monitor.

                                LINDSEY
                I already have, moron.

They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform.  Jammer and Hippy lower Little
Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it.  Hippy yells right up next to his
helmet.

                                HIPPY
                I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek!
                He should take you right to it.  All you gotta
                do is hang on!

Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge.

He looks up at her as he drops away.

In a few seconds, she can't see him.  Her chin quivers, minutely.

EXT. DEEPCORE/THE WALL                                                  198

FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness.
A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts
down.  It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.

He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.

Bud looks down.  Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the
glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness.  The wall
unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery.  He looks
up.  The lights of Deepcore are gone.  He feels  more alone than he has ever
felt.  He types out:  CANT SEE YOU

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                We're right here with you, Bud.  Your depth is
                3800 feet.  You're doing fine.

Bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall
like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     199

Everyone is grouped around the monitor screen, watching Bud's telemetry.  Bud
types out: GOOD DEAL ON SLIGHTLY USED CRANE.  They watch the depth meter
counting down.

                                MONK
                4800 feet.  It's official.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record
                for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think
                you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.

The screen print out:  CALL GUINESS.  They laugh.  So far so good.  Seconds
later...

                                HIPPY
                One mile down and still grinnin'.

WIDE SHOT.  Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little
pool of light.  The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth.
LOOKING DOWN, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness
yawning below.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     201

Lindsey has the microphone gripped tightly, and the lightness in her voice is
a bit brittle.

                                LINDSEY
                8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?

                                MONK
                Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision
                problems, euphoria.

                                LINDSEY
                Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.

ON THE SCREEN, printing out: COLD.

                                LINDSEY
                Big baby.

Then:  HANDS SHAKING.  HHARD TO TYPE.

                                MONK
                It's starting.  It hits the nervous system
                first.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Keep talking, Lindsey.  Just let him hear your
                voice.  It doesn't matter what about.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling
                as well as sentence structure, so concentrate,
                okay?
                              (long pause)
                Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say.
                It's hard for me.  I'm not of those softy, gooey-
                center-type people.  It's not easy, you know,
                being a cast-iron bitch.  It takes discipline
                and years of training.  A lot of people don't
                appreciate that.

Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room.  In her mind she is
with Bud, out in the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                But is wasn't all bad.  I know that.  You
                remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda
                up through Oregon?  It took me a week to get my
                hair untangled, but I've never been happier.  It
                was the most... free... I've ever felt.  I'm
                sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.

EXT. THE WALL                                                           202

Bud is visibly trembling, gritting his teeth... holding on as the vise-grip
of pressure takes him.

                                LINDSEY (V.O./filtered)
                It's pitiful.  I have to wait until you're
                freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand
                feet of water between us.  I guess I'm babbling.
                I'm sorry.

Bud struggles with his keyboard.

Somehow's she's smiling and on the verge of tears at the same time.

BLAM!  Bud jerks as his dive light implodes.  He still has Geek's floodlights.
He falls on.

                this.

                Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?

He types: SE LUMINUS THINNGS

Everyone snaps suddenly alert.

                                HIPPY
                Uh, oh...

                                LINDSEY

                                CATFISH
                Maybe it's... you know... them.

The screen prints out:  ITS OK. SQUID. GLOWING SQUID.

Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated
creatures less than a foot long.  Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs
around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see.  He stares at
them in wonder.  Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go.  Are
they really here?  He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.

Bud emerges from the school of squid.  As he falls, they form a luminous plane
of swirling colors above him.  He stares upwards, transfixed.  BUD'S POV, the
ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him.  A spectral form takes shape in
the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide.
Gazing down at him, her expression sad.  Her image receded away from him into
the darkness above as he falls.

DOWN ANGLE ON BUD, reaching up in anguish.

                I'm not going away, Bud.  I'm right here, right

Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy.  His eyes keep rolling back, and
he's having a hard time staying conscious.  He tries to type a message and he
can't.  The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous
system.  Suddenly K-BAM!  Little Geek's pressure hull implodes.  Its lights
go out.  BLACKNESS.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Little Geek just folded.

                                HIPPY
                Bye, little buddy.

                                MONK
                He can still make it.

                                LINDSEY
                I know how alone you feel... alone in all that
                cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark
                with you, Bud you're not alone...

Lindsey seems not to be in the room, but to be with him, seeing what he sees.
She is oblivious to the others.

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          212

Blackness.  Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.

It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge.  Bud discards the stalwart
little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute.  Out of control, he
hits a ledge and rolls off.  Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris.  He hits
another outcropping, limp as a rag doll.  Rocks and sand rain down with him
as he continues his descent.

Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.

He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.

In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to
the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of
air and light.  Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,
                you probably don't remember... the power went
                out at the old apartment, the one on Orange
                Street... and we were staring at that one little
                candle, and I said something really dumb like
                that candle is me, like every one of us is out
                there alone in the dark in this life...

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     213

TIGHT ON LINDSEY as she grips the microphone.  Her voice has become a hoarse
whisper.  Her eyes are intense, focused on a point far beyond the walls of the
room.

                                LINDSEY
              ... and you lit another candle and put it beside
                mine and said "that's me"... and we stared at
                the two candles, and then we... well, if you
                remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the
                next part.  Bud, there are two candles in the
                dark.  I'm with you.  I'll always be with you.

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          214

A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall.  Bud falls on in
dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     215

Catfish gently takes the microphone from Lindsey's hands and leans close.

                                CATFISH
                How you doin', podner?  Still with us, come-back?
                Talk to us, Buddy boy.

They watch the screen, expectantly.

Nothing.  Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment.  Lindsey tried
unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud?  You hangin' in there?  Talk to me, Bud.
                Are you okay?

There is an agonizing pause, then the letters appear slowly:  SHAKING STOPED.
FEEL BETER.  SOM LITE BELOW.

                                LINDSEY
                What kind of light?

LIGHT EVYWHER.  BEAWTIFULLL

                                MONK
                He's hallucinating badly.

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          216

Bud is no longer in pain.  His expression is rapt.

LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape.  His last flare sputters out,
but there is light.  Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him.  And he's right... it is beautiful.

The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted
figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels.  Barren as
the moon but exquisite, serene.  Changeless.  A place unseen by human eyes.
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible.  Bud descends toward
the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf.  Below the shelf, the wall
slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.

ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit.  Bud's feet thump into the
sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles.  Touchdown... three and
half miles of water over his head.  Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of
fireflies.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     217

AT GEEK prints out.  Monk takes the headset gently from Lindsey.

                                MONK
                Okay, Bud, we'll go step by step.  Take the
                cover plate off the firing box.

A long pause.  Then... PLATE OFF

                                MONK
                All right, Bud, you have to cut the ground wire,
                not the lead wire...

EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE                                                      218

Bud is peering into the detonator unit.  How bad is he?  We can't tell.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not...
                I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow
                stripe.

Bud is staring.  Blinking.  The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're
miles away... way down there where his hands are.

The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK.  He pulls out the little
plastic tube.  Breaks and shakes.  It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green
light.  He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters.
CUTING NNOW he types to them.  He reaches into the detonator.

DETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical.  The
cutters go over on wire.  A long beat.  They withdraw, then go over the other
wire...

He cuts--

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     219

Everyone is frozen.  Waiting.  It's very quiet.

                                LINDSEY
                Would we see the flash?

                                MONK
                Through three miles of water?   I don't know.

They're holding their breaths.  Then... STILL HERE

A cheer goes up.  Rebel yells.

                                CATFISH
                Quiet, quiet!  Save you air, goddamnit.

                                MONK
                Bud, give me a reading off you liquid oxygen
                gauge.

TEN MINUTES WORTH ID SAY.  Lindsey does white.

                                HIPPY
                It took him over an hour to get down there--

It's hopeless.  Lindsey grabs the headset from Monk.

                                LINDSEY
                Drop you weights and start back now!  The gauge
                could be wrong...

EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE                                                      220

Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead.  His expression is enigmatic.
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon.  Starts to type.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     221

The message comes in:  NO.  THINK ILL STAY A WHILE.  BEAUTIFUL HERE.  WORTH
ADMISSION

                                LINDSEY
                No!  You can make it!  You hear me?  Drop your
                weights... you... can breathe shallow... you...
                it could be wrong--

Lindsey's voice has twisted into a sob.  She begins to weep, quietly.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh God, Virgil, please...

DONT CRY BABY

A pause.  Then the words...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

Lindsey sobs at the mike.  The others look away.  The signal is weakening.
One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly.

LOVE YOU WIFE.

She stares at the printout.

                                LINDSEY
                Love you.

There is no reply.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          222

A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his
horse in the desert.

Bud's eyelids close.  His chest barely moving.

A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly,
he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.

BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to
be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.

It is stunningly beautiful.

The creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.

Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the
abyss.

At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They
resolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey
nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.

Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the
center, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing
their home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city.

EXT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   223

Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark
surface of inhuman design.  The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth.

They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-
like opening.

INT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   224

Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him.  It is a
curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,
where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional
space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet
across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      225

Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a
few feet.

A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the
chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.
They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.

Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees.
Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.
He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what
he can only hope is air.  It is.

Bud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is
happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the
NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven
is gathered watching him.

                                BUD
                Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?

His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water
from the 'walls'.

In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be
circuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in
mid-air.  The image is about twenty feet across.

There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into...
the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news.  STATIC, then another
newscast.  And another.  Fragments of the same story.  The world on the brink
of war.

                                BUD
                You watch out TV?  That what you're trying to
                say?  That you know what's been going on up
                there?

The NTIs are impassive.  Static... then another newscast.

This time, we're allowed to focus on the story.  An on-the-scene interview
outside a high-tech seismology lab.  There is an air of hysteria about the
scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people
shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist.

                                REPORTER
              ... a Caltech scientist who is among those
                reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the
                world's oceans.  Dr. Breg, can you give us a
                clearer explanation then we're getting?

Berg is edgy and distracted.  People keeps handing him pieces of paper,
computer hardcopy.  The biggest thing in his life is happening...

                                BERG
                They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but
                with no seismological source.  The waves are
                propagating toward the shorelines of every
                continent--

An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning.  We see that Berg is
running scared.  The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational
mind.

                                BERG
                Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go.
                Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the
                slightest goddamn idea!

The image dissolves into static, fades out.  Bud turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                You're doing it!  Right?  That's what you're
                telling me.  Yeah, you can control water...
                that's your technology.  But why?

Static again, then a brilliant flash.  Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb
test in the Pacific.

The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an
unbroken white glare.  Bud gets the message.

                                BUD
                Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it.
                Where do you get off passing judgment on us,
                when you can't be sure?  How do you know?

The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments
from recent history...

US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in
Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and
bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at
Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old
contra with an AK-47...  Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each.
But enough.  The images continue.

HOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of
humanity.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA -- DAY                  226

A video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and
runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean.  Pandemonium reigns around
them, people running, driving, evacuating inland.

On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared.

It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the
horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    227

LONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the
Verazzano Narrows.  Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of
water impossibly high, still miles out.

EXT. NAVAL BASE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                 228

The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia,
where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave.

SIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base.
Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and
growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT, SANTA MONICA -- DAY                                   229

The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his
voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg
disaster.

                                REPORTER
                The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting
                to run... some are just staring, unable to
                move... the wave... the wave is... it's...
                I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high
                already... getting bigger as I'm watching...
                still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can
                hear it...

A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.  They
leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    230

The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is
blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall.

EXT. SAN FRANSISCO -- DAY                                               231

LONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the
buildings downtown.  Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which
defies our comprehension.  The image shakes with the THUNDER.

EXT. MALIBU -- DAY                                                      232

A diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which
transcends his worst nightmare.  He lies paralyzed on his board.

EXT. MIAMI -- DAY                                                       233

Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith.

In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him,
blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over,
about to break upon the teeming city.

And then...

The wave slows as it crests...

And stops.

IT SIMPLY STOPS.

2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun.  There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls.  Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover,
only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.  A news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.

EXT. MALIBU                                                             234

The surfer just blinks, starting.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    235

On the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a
shimmering blue wall which stands... waiting.

EXT. PETROPAVLOVSK NAVAL BASE, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                        236

Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the
Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the
moonlight.  It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable
devastation... but it doesn't.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA                                     237

When all have seen...

The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface
of the sea is normal again.

VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea.  Moving from
face to face.  Various reactions as people respond to what they can only
understand as a miracle.  The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked...
laughing.  The cameraman is just walking.  Some people turn to him and smile,
or laugh, or whoop.

A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying.

A man is on his knees, shaking.

Total strangers hug each other.

A black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific
grin.

                                GUY
                Somebody just laid it down to us, man.  Things
                ain't never gonna be the same!

PULL BACK to reveal that we are in the...

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      238

Bud sits, shaken, watching the screen, as people react to their deliverance.
He turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                Why?  You could've done it.  Why didn't you?

The screen darkens.  Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if
someone was clumsily typing them.

WE KNEW THIS WAS...

And we've seen this before so we know the rest...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

A pause, then:

LOVE YOU WIFE

The last message expands to fill the entire screen.

Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the
aliens.  They bow their heads, just for a moment.  A sign of respect.

CLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            239

Lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring.  Withdrawn.

The others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark.

The air is looking pretty thick.  The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver
crackles to life.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                Deepcore, do you read?  This is Benthic Explorer,
                over.

                                CATFISH
                Hell yes, we read!  Good of you to join us.  How's
                that storm doin'?

                                MCBRIDE
                Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew
                itself out all of the sudden.  We're up here in
                a flat sea with no wind.  But then a lot of weird
                things've been happening.

                                CATFISH
                Well, hell, son.  You better get us a line down
                here, we're in moderately poor shape.

LATER, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring B.G. on how to get a new
umbilical hooked on.  One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone.

                                MCBRIDE
                They figure is was over a half mile high.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I wish I could have seen it--

She glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Hey.  Hey!  HEY!!  Look... it's Bud.

                                MONK
                That's impossible.

Lindsey bolts to the screen.  Stares at the message printing out.

A huge grin wraps around her face.

                                LINDSEY
                No it's not.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                What's it say?

Lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen.  During the message, her
voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a
childlike joy.

INTERCUT BETWEEN DEEPCORE AND EXPLORER BRIDGE DURING THE FOLLOWING:

                                LINDSEY
                It says...
                "VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW
                FRIENDS DOWN HERE/I GUESS THEYVE BEEN HERE AWHILE/
                THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE
                US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY"

Lindsey grins as she reads the next part...

                                LINSEY
                "THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT"

                                CATFISH
                I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack.

                                LINDSEY
                "THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY
                CHILDISH THINGS/OF COURSE ITS JUST A SUGGESTION."

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                     240

Beyond the windows the ocean is calm.  The sky steel-gray put placid.  McBride
turns to Commodore DeMarco and the Navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked.

                                MCBRIDE
                Looks like you boys might by out of business.

                                BENDIX
                Something's going on down there.  I'm getting
                some big readings....

Bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a
Wurlitzer.

INT. DEEPCORE                                                           241

In Deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling.  The sonar
is going crazy.  One Night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to
her ear, then jerks it away.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Whew!  Whatever this is, it's major.

The rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water.

The glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the
viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance.

A last message appears on the screen:

KEEP YOU PANTYHOSE ON/YOURE GONNA LOVE THIS

The radiance intensifies.  Everyone covers their eyes.  It flares to
WHITE-OUT.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT./EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                        242

Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts.  All their instruments are pegged.

                                BENDIX
                Active is pinging back something big... it's
                enormous!  Coming up right under us.

                                DEMARCO
                Where?

                                BENDIX
                Where?  EVERYWHERE!!
                         (looks out the window)
                Over there!  Port bow.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN                                         243

A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not
swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.

It gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.

The ocean is OPENING.

Now the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.

McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.

The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.

The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.

SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly
curving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.

Off the port bow... another spire.

And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.

Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.

One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
CREATION.

And now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A
PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.

THE NTI ARK.

It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.

The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.

ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God.

                                BENDIX
                Look...

WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore
Two.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the
glistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.

CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.

Catfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind
him.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into
the light of the sun.  A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever
know.

                                LINDSEY
                We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.

                                CATFISH
                Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-
                up Coke.

                                HIPPY
                They must've done something to us.

Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for
their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for
the whole human race.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh, yes.  I think you could say that.

She blinks.  Seeing something not far away.  She gives a little laugh, or
something between laughing and crying.

REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.

She starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.

His smile, his eyes illuminating her.

He stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?

The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.

Then laugh.  She sniffs loudly.

                                LINDSEY
                Hello, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

Their lips meet.

TITLE: THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK, DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY                                            3

Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4

In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around
BARNES, the sonarman.

                                CAPTAIN
                Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't
                have anything that fast.

                                BARNES
                Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique
                signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...
                doesn't even sound like screws.

He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey.

                                CAPTAIN
                What the hell is it?

                                EXEC
                I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of
                ours.

                                BARNES
                Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four,
                diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots!

                                EXEC
                Eighty knots...

                                BARNES
                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

                                FRANK
                           (simultaneously)
                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the
intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side-
scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.

                                EXEC
                          (low, to Captain)
                It's getting tight in here.

                                CAPTAIN
                We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come
                right to oh six niner, down five degrees.

                                HELMSMAN
                Coming right to oh six niner, sir.  Down five
                degrees.

                                NAVIGATOR
                Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet
                narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a
                proximity warning light.

                                EXEC
                That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off.

                                BARNES
                Range to contact, two hundred.  Contact junked to
                bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one
                hundred thirty knots, sir!

                                EXEC
                         (really freaked now)
                Nothing goes one thirty!

Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.

EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     5

We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     6

The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted.

                                EXEC
                Turbulence!  We're in its wake!

SIRENS.  Everyone shouting at once.  The power flickers low.

                                CAPTAIN
                Helm, all stop!  Full right rudder!

                                HELMSMAN
                All stop.  Full right rudder.  Hydraulic failure.
                Planes are not responding, sir!

Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan
display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM.

                                HELMSMAN
                Hydraulics restored, sir.

EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     7

The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!

INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8

With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner
hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods,
blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray.

INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9

Everyone is hurled off his feet.  The planesman flights to recover control of
the yoke.

                                CAPTAIN
                Collision alarm!  Collision alarm!  Lighten
                her up, Charlie!

                                NAVIGATOR
                The torpedo room is flooded, sir!

                                CAPTAIN
                Blow all tanks!  Blow everything!

                                HELMSMAN
                Passing twelve hundred feet...

                                EXEC
                Blowing main tanks!

                                HELMSMAN
                Twelve hundred fifty feet...

EXT. MONTANA                                                            10

The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.

INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM                                               11

The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified.

The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din...

                                CAPTAIN
                We're losing her.  Launch the buoy!

The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button.  A red light
comes on.  The Captains takes a deep breath.

A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface.  A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as...
Seawater blasts down the corridors --
Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls --
Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds --
Bursts through hatches into the reactor room --
Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second.

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER                                                   14

In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.  Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough.  The abyss.

Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky.  The
Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting.

LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.

REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.

The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum "company man" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/BRIDGE -- DAY                                     17

The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation
and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video
monitors.  The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX,
the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.

                                MCBRIDE
                Does not look good at all.

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working in total
blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean.  They
move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like
space-suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses.

                No light from the surface.  How deep are they?

                Seventeen hundred feet.

WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead.

                                DEMARCO
                I need them to go to over two thousand.

                                KIRKHILL
                They can do it.

EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY (TOTAL DARKNESS)                                 18

1700 FEET BELOW.  A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two "tri-
modules" consisting of three cylinders each.  These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
"toolpusher," BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.

                                BUD
                Hey, you guys are milking that job.

Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor.  The working heart of
the rig.  THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR.  The drill crew, in hardhats and mud-
plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY
DIETZ.  Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive
roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest.

                                JAMMER
                               (yelling)
                Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call
                from topside.  That new company man.

                                BUD
                Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from
                a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

One of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him.

                                BUD
                Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and
                those cable slings.  This place is starting to
                look like my apartment.

Perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully.  Bud EXITS, ducking his head
through a low watertight hatch.

INT. CORRIDOR/TOOLPUSHER'S OFFICE                                       21

Bud tromps down the narrow corridor, his work boots gonging on steel.

                                P.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE)
                BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT.

                                BUD
                I'm coming.  Keep your pantyhose on.

He enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust-
gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs.  He picks up the
phone... punches down a line.

                                BUD
                Brigman here.  Kirkhill?  What's going on?
                              (pause)
                I am calm.  I'm a calm person.  Is there some
                reason why I shouldn't be calm?

HOLD ON Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens.

INT. CORRIDOR/CONTROL MODULE                                            22

The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago,
packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN.

Hippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch.

He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked
DIVER RECALL.  A SIREN, blasting through the water from a big hydrophone
loudspeaker.

                                BUD
                All divers.  Drop what you're doing.  Everybody
                out of the pool.

EXT. DEEPCORE/CHRISTMAS TREE                                            A22

Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Here you go, hon'.

                                SONNY
                Just in time, sugar.

They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Dammit, we just got out here.

                                SONNY
                There was a time when I would have asked why.

One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he
narrowly avoids.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER SUB-BAY                                             23

Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny
riding on its top deck.  It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the
surface of the water in the chamber above.  Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog.

INT. SUB-BAY/MOONPOOL                                                   24

The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched
through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-
fingered.  Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish
face.

                                FINLER
                What's goin' on?  How come we got recalled?

                                SONNY
                Hell is I know.

One Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them.  Catfish
is unzipping his bulky dry-suit.

                                CATFISH
                Just follow standard procedure, will ya...
                flog the dog till somebody tells us what's
                happening.

                                JAMMER
                Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse
                for twenty bucks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all
                stuck together by now.

Bud enters, approaching the group.

                                JAMMER
                What's goin' on, Boss?

                                BUD
                Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole
                and prepare to move the rig.

                                SONNY
                She-hit.

                                BUD
                We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of
                national security.  Now you know exactly as much
                as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to
                control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten
                minutes.

The whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing.
DeMarco is on the main monitor, with his aides and Kirkhill visible b.g.

                                DEMARCO
                At 09:22 local time this morning, an American
                nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men
                aboard, went down 22 miles from here.  There has
                been no contact with the sub since then.  The
                cause of the incident is not known.

PAN AROUND the reactions of the various drill crew members... shocked,
hushed, curious.

                                DEMARCO
                Your company has authorized the Navy's use of
                this facility for a rescue operation.  The code
                name is Operation Salvor.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You want us to search for the sub?

                                DEMARCO
                No.  We know where it is.  But she's in 2000 feet
                of water and we can't reach her.  We need divers
                to enter the sub and search for survivors, if
                any.

Bud's scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to talk.

                                BUD
                Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type
                of thing?

                                DEMARCO
                By the time we get our rescue submersible here
                the storm front will be right on us.  But you
                can get your rig in under the storm and be on-
                site in fifteen hours.  That makes you our best
                option right now.

Hippy, born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid, leans forward...

                I have been authorized to offer you all special-
                duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal
                dive pay.

                                CATFISH
                Hell, for triple time I'd crawl through razor
                blades and shower off with lime juice.

                I'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire
                and call me names.

                Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys
                worked out with the company, but my people are
                not qualified for this... they're oil workers.

                                DEMARCO
                A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to you
                to supervise the operation.

                                BUD
                You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the
                toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the
                safety of these people, there's me... then
                there's God.  Understand?  If things get dicey,
                I'm pulling the plug.

                I think we're all on the same wavelength,
                Brigman.  Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled,

PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.

WIDER, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs.  And a slender woman in
her early thirties.  She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket.  Meet LINDSEY.  Project Engineer for
Deepcore.  She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.  Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.  The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.  They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.  The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position.  Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic
Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.

                No way I'm putting her down.  I shouldn't even
                be flying in this shit.

                                COFFEY
                                (cool)
                Just hold it over the deck.

Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft.  He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK.  In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil.  One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping
to the deck.  One, two, three.  Coffey looks at her.

                                COFFEY
                You want to be on that ship, there's only one
                way it's going to happen.

He's sure she won't go for it.  It's his certainty that gets her.  She sets
her jaw.  Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth.  Then grabs
the rope and slides down.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/HELIPAD                                           29

Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty
feet to the deck.  She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides.  Her nylons are
ruined.  An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling.  The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck.  They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN BOTTOM                                                       30

BLACKNESS.  Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock.
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables.  Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern
thrusters.

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            31

Bud, his feet propped up, uses joystick controls to 'fly' Deepcore,
maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles.  He is guided
by the side-scan sonar display, with Hippy assisting in the sonar shack.
Through the front viewport, Flatbed can be seen out ahead.

McBride appears on the bridge monitor, holding a sheet of weather-fax.

                                MCBRIDE (on screen)
                Well, it's official, sportsfans.  They're calling
                it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be
                making our lives real interesting in a few hours.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                             32

Bud responds via video.

                                BUD
                Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be
                named after women.

McBride looks up as the bridge door opens.  Lindsey enters in a blast of wind,
wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off.  Maybe Bud is right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            33

Bud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen.

                                LINDSEY
                I can't believe you let them do this!

                                BUD
                     (unpreturbed, almost cheerful)
                Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

                                LINDSEY
                I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last
                flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left
                it, is it, Bud?

                                BUD
                Wasn't up to me.

                                LINDSEY
                We were that close to proving a submersible
                drilling platform could work.  We had over seven
                thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I
                can't believe you let them grab my rig!

                                BUD
                Your rig?

                                LINDSEY
                My rig.  I designed the damn thing.

                                BUD
                Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long
                as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they
                tell me.

                                LINDSEY
                You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They
                bought you... more like least rented you cheap--

                                BUD
                I'm switching off now.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up
                to fight.  You--

Bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead.

                                BUD
                Bye.

Hippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up.

                                HIPPY
                Virgil?

                                BUD
                God, I hate that bitch.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah, well you never should have married her then.

Bud nods fatalistically.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. EXPLORER DECK/LAUNCH WELL                                          34

Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.  It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls.  Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.

Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.

She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck.  Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go, gentlemen!  We either launch now or
                we don't launch.

Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.

                                LINDSEY
                Take her up, Byron!

Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.  The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well.  It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below.  Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             35

Kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window.

                                KIRKHILL
                What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a
                bitch...
                           (into microphone)
                Lindsey... get out of Cab Three.  Bates is taking
                her down.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          36

Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the
hatch.

                                LINDSEY
                Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in
                this thing than he does.
                              (to Coffey)
                A little change of plan.

The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs,
jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into
the walls.  Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks.

                                COFFEY
                Lady, we better fish or cut bait.

                                LINDSEY
                Just hold your water, okay?
                             (to Kirkhill)
                So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk
                about it?

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C.                                             37

The plug is pulled on DeMarco's patience.

                                DEMARCO
                I don't care who drives the damn thing.  Just get
                my team in the water.

                                KIRKHILL
                Alright, alright.  Christ Almighty!

He gestured dismissively to McBride.

                                MCBRIDE
                Cab Three, you are clear to launch.

INT./EXT. CAB THREE                                                     38

Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever.

                                LINDSEY
                Roger.
                              (to Coffey)
                There's only one way it's going to happen...

She pulls the lever hard.  CLUNK-CLANG!  The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks.  Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.

                                LINDSEY
                Touchdown.  The crowd goes wild.  Explorer...
                Cab Three.  We are styling.

                                MCBRIDE (filtered)
                Roger, Cab Three.

Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so
that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port.  Moving up
through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig.  Cab Three free-falls
into increasing darkness.  Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo.

EXT./INT. FLATBED                                                       39

One Night is driving the tug one-handed, pouring coffee from a thermos and
rocking out to the great truck-driving song "Willing" on the beat-box she's
got propped up on the sonar rig.  Fighting white-line fever in the best
tradition.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     40

Bud and Hippy come in for a rousing chorus.

                                BUD/HIPPY
              ... I've been driving every kinda rig that's
                ever been maaaaade...

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           41

Lit up like a proud Peterbilt, the rig crossed the trackless wastes.  We
hear them singing, carried OVER.

EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS/CAB THREE                                             42

In total blackness, the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the
umbilical cable.  Two hundred feet below it, the lights of Deepcore resolve
out of the darkness.  Now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom
like some monster lawnmower.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on
                final approach.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You,
                Lindsey?

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            43

Bud stop singing and snaps around at the mention of her name.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                None other.

Bud's expression is nothing less than stricken.

                                BUD
                Oh no... you gotta be kidding me.

EXT./CAB THREE/DEEP CORE                                                44

Lindsey executes a 180 degree turn and cruises over the control module, back
through the A-frame toward the docking hatch.  The flange of Cab Three's
lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rig's back.  There is
a CLUNK as it mates up.

INT. DEEPCORE/COMPRESSION CHAMBER/GAS CONTROL STATION                   45

Lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber.
The SEALs drop down behind her, passing their gear through hand-over-hand.
The chamber is spartan, with steel benches, a folding card table, breathing
masks, and medical supplies.  Catfish greets them through the tiny porthole
at one end.

                                CATFISH
                Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned!
                You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll
                might run ya stockings.

                                LINDSEY
                Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us?
                Good.  Couldn't ask for better.

                                CATFISH
                Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.

HISSSS of inrushing compressed gas.  The pressure in the chamber rises.  The
breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen.  Catfish
monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the
gauges with a practiced eye.  Lindsey and the SEALs all grab their noses
and start making funny faces... popping their ears with the familiar diver's
'equalization' technique.  They continue as:

                                LINDSEY
                Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six
                hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news
                is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress
                back to the surface later.

                                COFFEY
                We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright,
                from now on we watch each other closely for
                signs of HPNS...

                                MONK
                           (as if by rote)
                High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors,
                usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased
                excitability, disorientation.

                                LINDSEY
                Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't
                handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to
                predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.

                                COFFEY
                Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth.
                We're checked out.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.
                          (Coffey turn away)
                Well, hey... you guys know any songs?

They ignore her.  Start going over some diagrams of the Montana's interior.
It's going to be a long six hours.

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION -- HOURS LATER                                 46

Catfish checks his watch, then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri-
mix manifold, watching the gauges.  Satisfied, he leans over to the pressure
window in the door, checking out the SEALs.  Hippy has come down from the
control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers.  Jammer is in a chair,
reading a Louis L'Amour paperback.

                                CATFISH
                Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of
                guys tougher'n them.

                                HIPPY
                Now we get to hear about how he used to be a
                contender.

Catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of Hippy's face.

                                CATFISH
                You see this?  They used to call this the Hammer.

                                JAMMER
                Hippy wasn't born then.

INT. PRESSURE CHAMBER                                                   47

It looks like the end of a long bus trip.  Everyone silent... leafing
through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring.  Lindsey has her feet propped
up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases.  She casually toes open
one of the latches, then the other.  Glances at Coffey.  He's reading.  She
begins to lift the lid with her toe.  Gets a GLIMPSE INSIDE, of packing foam,
and what looks like a SMALL BLACK METAL BOX.  Then... WHAM!  Coffey's foot
comes down on the lid, slamming it shut.  Startled, she looks up into his
cool gaze.

                                COFFEY
                Curiosity killed the cat.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. GAS CONTROL STATION/CHAMBER DOOR -- LATER                          48

TIGHT ON CATFISH'S hands... closing values... spinning the wheel on the
chamber hatch.  CUT WIDER as it cracks open with a virgin's sigh and swings
aside.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all'er done to a turn and ready to serve.
                Everybody okay?

The SEALs nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear.  Lindsey exists first,
followed by Monk, Wilhite, and Schoenick.  Coffey bends to relatch the small
equipment case.  He is alone for one moment in the chamber.  He raises his
hand and stares at it.  The fingertips are trembling the slightest bit.  He
clenches them into a fist and walks out.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           49

As Lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig, she bumps into a large,
dark mass.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey, was there a wall here before?  I don't
                remember a wall here.  Oh, Jammer!  Hi.

The 'wall' grins down to her.

                                JAMMER
                Howdy, there, little lady.

Coffey emerges behind them and, ignoring Lindsey, faces Jammer.

                                COFFEY
                              (to Jammer)
                Show us the dive prep area.  We need to check
                out your gear.

Jammer scowls, turns and leads the SEALs in the sub-bay.  Catfish and Lindsey
exchange a look.

                                LINDSEY
                Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     50

TIGHT ON HIPPY, bathed in the light of the sonar display.  He is making
kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's
lips.

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.

WIDER, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway.  She and Bud
size each other up.  He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary.

                                BUD
                Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.

                                LINDSEY
                Not for long.

Lindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost
unconsciously checking, checking... getting the pulse of her big iron baby.

                                BUD
                You never did like being called that, did you?

                                LINDSEY
                Not even when it meant something.
                     (looking through the front port)
                Is that One Night up in Flatbed?

                                BUD
                Who else?

Lindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console.

                                LINSEY
                Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey.

INT. FLATBED                                                            51

One Night mimes a puking motion, finger down her throat.  Then she replies
with sickening sweetness...

                                ONE NIGHT
                Oh, hi, Lindsey.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     52

Lindsey fives the sonar shack the once-over.  She tweaks some knobs.

                                BUD
                I can't believe you were dumb enough to come
                down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm...
                dumb, hot-rod... dumb.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, I didn't come down here to fight.

She crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor.  Bud bolts out of the chair
to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to take over.

INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER-WELL/LEVEL ONE LANDING                             53

Bud catches up with Lindsey in the corridor, and through the following keeps
pace with here as she make here inspection.

                                BUD
                Then why'd you come down?

She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe.  He almost slams into her.  She
moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level.

                                LINDSEY
                You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this
                rig better than I do.  What is something was
                to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What
                would have you done?

                                BUD
                Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've
                had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a
                disaster.

On the lower level landing, Lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine
rooms.  ROAR OF PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       54

Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and
roaring machinery.  Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit
panels.

                                BUD
                             (yelling)
                You wanna know what I think?

                                LINDSEY
                Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set!
                Morons.

She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely.

                                BUD
                I think you were worried about me.

                                LINDSEY
                That must be it.

Lindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up.

                                BUD
                No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.

                                LINDSEY
                I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four
                years invested in this project.

                                BUD
                Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years
                with me.

She looks up at him.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got to have priorities.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. BUD'S ROOM                                                         55

Darkness.  The door opens and Bud snaps on the light.

                                BUD
                My bunk's the only one I can guarantee won't be
                occupied.  You can grab a couple hours before
                we get there.

Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the
rig.  Rank had its privileges.  His hand on the door is just level with her
eyes.  She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium
(something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from
M.I.T.).

                                LINDSEY
                What are you still wearing that for?

                                BUD
                I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to
                take it off.

Bud stays in the doorway.  Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the
narrow bunk.  Start unconsciously straightening the room.

                                LINDSEY
                I haven't worn mine in months.

                                BUD
                Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The
                Suit.

                                LINDSEY
                Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit?
                It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name
                is Michael.

Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks.

Bud eyes her, sounding too causal.

                                BUD
                So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks
                Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?

                                LINDSEY
                No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.

                                BUD
                What happened?

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of
                you life any more.

                                BUD
                I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one
                day and realized the guy never made you laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple.
                Aren't you clever?  You should get your own
                show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn
                from three hundred fathoms.

She closes the watertight door, forcing him out.  Locks it.  She turns and
throws her shoe hard against the far wall.

                                LINDSEY
                AAAARRRGGH!

She flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall.  Her armor is
gone.  She looks small and vulnerable.  A long beat.  She reaches over to the
tiny sink.  Amid the clutter is a bottle of Bud's aftershave.  She unscrews
it and takes a sniff.  Catches herself.  Tosses it.

                                LINDSEY
                Shit.

INT. QUARTERS/HEAD                                                      56

Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger.  He pulls
the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet.  He reaches forward to
flush.  Can't do it.  Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the
toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring.
He puts it on and washes his hands.  The right hand stays faintly blue no
matter how hard he scrubs.

                                BUD
                Shit.

                                                                CUT TO:

The platform is stopped, hovering in place.  Like a great spacecraft setting
down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze.  Flatbed
releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside.

                                                                CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH, actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from
a towed LIDAR (laser imaging sonar) rig.  It shows a faint, blurry outline of
the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall.  There
is no detail.  A finger points to a flat ledge nearby.  An "X" has been put
on with a grease pencil.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                This is us.  We're just on the edge of the Cayman
                Trough.  The Montana is here, on its side, 300
                meters away and 70 meters below us.  We think she
                slid down the wall, and lodged against this
                outcropping.

CUT WIDE, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub-bay.
The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have
their dry-suits on.  The pre-dive briefing.  Lindsey, One Night, and Hippy
will crew the submersibles.  Wilhite is going around clipping DOSIMETER
BADGES on everybody.

                                SONNY
                This tells us how much radiation we get?

                                HIPPY
                Hey, whoah... I can't handle no radiation, man.
                Forget it!  Include me out.

                                CATFISH
                Hippy, you pussy.

                                HIPPY
                What good's the money if your dick drops off in
                six months?

                                COFFEY
                We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's
                breached or the warheads have released
                radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.

                                BUD
                Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you
                can run Little Geek.

Bud pats the top of a small ROV, sitting next to its larger brother, Big
Geek.

                                HIPPY
                No way!  No way!  He can't fly an ROV worth
                shit.  I'll go.  Shit!

                                COFFEY
                               (to all)
                On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing
                without direct orders from me, and you will
                follow my instructions without discussion.  Is
                this clear?  Alright, I want everyone finished
                prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.

The rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear.  Some are studying
the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout.  Bud takes Coffey aside as
the others prepare.

                                BUD
                Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on
                bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better
                start cutting them some slack.

                                COFFEY
                I can't afford slack, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me,
                you start ordering my guys around.  It won't
                work.  You gotta know how to handle these
                people... we have a certain way of doing things
                here.

                                COFFEY
                I'm not interested in your way of doing things.
                Just get your team ready to dive.

End of discussion.  Coffey is walking away.  Burning, Bud crosses to his gear
locker.  Picks up his helmet.  Finler is suiting out next to him.

                                FINLER
                Hey, you know your hand is blue?

                                BUD
                Shut up and get your gear on.

NEARBY, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable.  Hippy
points to the heavy equipment case that says F.B.S. DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.

                                HIPPY
                I've been meaning to ask you what this thing is.

Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like
a space helmet, and a large backpack.

                                MONK
                Fluid breathing system.  We just got them.  We
                use it if we need to go really deep.

                                HIPPY
                How deep?

                                MONK
                Deep.
                     (shrugs)
                It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you
                breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed.
                Pressure doesn't get to you.

Catfish is grappling with the concept.

                                CATFISH
                You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?

                                MONK
                Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.

Monk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf and dumps them
out.  He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside
it to drain into the box.  Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's
shoulder.

                                HIPPY
                Hey!

                                MONK
                Check this out.

He drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid.
Beany is forced under the surface.  He struggled for a second, and bubbles
come out of his mouth.  Then he casually swims around in there, completely
submerged... breathing liquid.  Catfish and the others stare into the box,
amazed.

                                MONK
                See?  He's diggin' it.

Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his
lungs.  Then hands him back to Hippy.  The rat is annoyed, but otherwise
alright.

                                CATFISH
                This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest
                thing I ever saw.

                                                                CUT TO:

Three sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore.  Cab One and Three,
with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the
Flatbed.  Lindsey is in the lead.  She approaches the cliff-like drop-off
and starts to descend.

                                LINDSEY
                Com-check, everybody.  Flatbed, you on line?

                Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and clear.

                                LINDSEY
                Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                What's you depth, Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                1840... 50... 60... 70...

                                LINDSEY
                Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065.
                Everybody stay tight and in sight.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Starting out descent.  Divers, how're you doing?

EXT. FLATBED                                                            60

Eight divers ride the back of Flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to
the fields.  Bud and his civilian crew, Catfish, Finler, and Jammer... sit
across from the SEALs.  They are in their gear and breathing from umbilical
hooked in Flatbed's low-pressure manifold.

                                BUD
                Okay so far.

                                JAMMER
                How deep's the drop-off here?

                                CATFISH
                This here's the bottomless pit, baby.  Two and
                a half miles straight down.

                                COFFEY
                Knock off the chatter.  Cab One, you getting
                anything?

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       61

Lindsey consults her array of instruments.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, do you see it yet?

                                LINDSEY
                The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing
                a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are
                you sure you got the depth right on this?

                                BUD (V.O., filtered)
                You should be almost to it, ace.

She turns the submersible and...

The spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the Montana.  It
dwarfs Cab One, FILLING FRAME.

                                LINDSEY
                Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.

EXT. MONTANA/SUBMERSIBLES                                               62

Cab One maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab
Three move above it.  Wilhite take readings with a hand-held neutron counter.

                                COFFEY
                Cab One, radiation readings?

                                LINDSEY
                Neutron counter's not showing very much.

                                COFFEY
                Wilhite, anything?

                                WILHITE
                Negative.  Nominal.

                                COFFEY
                Just continue forward along the hull.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want
                me to get shots of everything, right?

                                COFFEY
                Roger, document as much as you can, but keep
                moving.  We're on a tight timeline.

                                LINDSEY
                Copy that.

The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the
puny beams of their lights.  It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as
eerie in its final resting place.  On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a
wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving.  Ahead, in the lights, is
a white painted circle.

                                COFFEY
                That's the midship hatch.  You see it, Cab Three?

                                HIPPY
                Roger, I see it.

                                BUD
                Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.

                                HIPPY
                Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?

                                COFFEY
                Right.

                                ONE NIGHT
                How do you want me?

                                COFFEY
                Just hold above it.  Alright, A team.

Wilhite, Schoenick, and Monk unhook their short whip-umbilicals from the
central manifold and roll off the side of Flatbed.  They maneuver down toward
the sub's hatch.  Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          63

Hippy turns to Perry back in the lockout chamber, ready to launch Little Geek.
The ROV has a handheld neutron-counter gripped in its manipulator arm.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Stand by on the ROV.

                                HIPPY
                Perry, stand by on the ROV.
                           (to Little Geek)
                Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than
                me, know what I mean?

Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and
feed out a length of tether.  Hippy picks up the control box and watches the
video screen, guiding the ROV toward the Montana's hatch.

EXT. MONTANA HATCH AREA                                                 64

The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.  They
open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.  He bangs
on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed
against it.

                                MONK
                It's flooded.  Alright, I'm opening her up.

Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims
backs out immediately.  He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and
Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE/MISSLE DECK                                           65

Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull.  Beyond
Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll
toward us in procession.  Several of the hatch covers have been forced
partway open by the warping of the hull.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still
                be intact.

                                LINDSEY
                How many are there?

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.

                                LINDSEY
                That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are
                they?

                                SCHOENICK
                Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons
                nominal yield.  Say times time Hiroshima.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a
                can.

                                COFFEY (V.O.)
                Let's knock off the chatter, please.

INT. CAB THREE                                                          66

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN -- LITTLE GEEK'S CAMERA.  Passing through a hatch, into
a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery.  The engine room.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                Getting a reading?

                                HIPPY
                It's twitching but it's below the line you said
                was safe.

EXT. MONTANA MIDSHIP HATCH                                              67

Monk moves into the opening.

                                MONK
                Alright.  Let's get in there.

Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark
corridor beyond.

EXT. MONTANA/BOW SECTION                                                68

Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a
five-story building.  Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the
ledge which supports the vast sub.  Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal
the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.  The torn
and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down.

Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away
from the rest of the hull.

                                COFFEY
                We'll go in through that large breach.

                                BUD
                Let's go, guys.

Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.  The opening is a black mouth in
their lights.  Coffey moves inside.  Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon
line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him.

                                BUD
                Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in
                sight.  Watch for hatches that could close on
                you, or any loose equipment that could fall.

Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside.

INT. MONTANA/FORWARD BERTHING SECTION                                   69

They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of
bunks.  The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the
bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs.  Papers float in gentle
eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends.
Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward.  As they pass sealed doors,
Coffey pounds with a tool, listening.  All flooded.

INT. ENGINE ROOM                                                        70

Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether.  Through
a hatch into the engine room.  Their lights play over flooded machinery.

INT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER                        71

From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack
center.  He pulls at a buckled watertight door.

                                COFFEY
                It's jammed.  Give me a hand.

Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey.  Together they wrench the door open
on its squealing hinges.  It give way suddenly, flying open.  The suction
pulls SOMETHING THROUGH.  It slams Bud's shoulder.  He turns.  A FACE...
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!  He jerks back, gasping.

Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman.  The ensign seems unmarked, merely
dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth.  Coffey
reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way.

                                COFFEY
                Alright, let's keep moving.  We knew we were
                going to see this.

They enter the control room.  Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage.
Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl
in the currents.  A languid, weightless waltz.  They move through the carnage.
Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair,
someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down.  Dead faces, pale in the
lights.  Still.  We see only glimpses.

Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over.  Removes the missile
arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck.  Moves on. All
business.  Bud turns back to his guys.  Checking them.  He notices Jammer is
breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet.  Catfish, Finler, and Sonny
aren't much better.  A wave a panic seems imminent.

                                BUD
                How you guys doing?

                                SONNY
                I'm alright, I'm dealing.

                                CATFISH
                Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It
                ain't.  I'm sorry...

                                BUD
                We're here now.  Let's get her done.

We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it.  He's sweating
rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady.  His projection of calm to the
others is his own salvation.

Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room.

                                COFFEY
                This part I do alone.  Brigman, take you men and
                continue aft.  Split up into two teams of two.
                Let's get moving... we head back in fourteen
                minutes.

Bud leads his team into a narrow corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR/ROOMS                                                     72

They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to
a vertical hatch, open.  a pit of darkness below.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny.  You guys stay on this
                deck.  Hook you line onto mine.  Any problem,
                you tug my line.  Two pulls.  Jammer, you're
                with me.

Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who
barely fits through.  Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a
carabiner and move along the corridor with the others.

EXT./INT. CAB ONE                                                       73

Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing.  Her strobes sear the
darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible
circles it like a bee.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTER                                              74

Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens
it.  He removes several plastic binders... the code books.  He also grabs
handfuls of classified documents and orders, and a set of missile arming keys,
all which he places in a pouch at his waist.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           75

Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping
on the walls and hatches periodically.  After he taps, he waits a few
moments.  There are no answering taps.  They open doors and shine their lights
into the rooms.  The are bodies, but they seem anonymous.  Crumpled shapes
in khaki or blue.  They undog and open a hatch.  Beyond it is the largest
chamber of the sub, the...

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 76

The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long
and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all.  The
chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork.

                                JAMMER
                Where are we?

                                BUD
                Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.

They sweep their lights around the chamber.  Jammer turns... his beam
illuminating a body just beyond the door.  A coveralled seaman turning
slowly in the eddying current.  Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the
man's face.  One scuttles out of his gaping mouth.

                                JAMMER
                Lord Almighty.

                                BUD
                Hey, you okay?

Bud goes to him.  Gets up close to his face.  Sees that he's not.  That he's
hyperventilating.  Fighting nausea.  Bud grabs him by the shoulders.

                                BUD
                Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just
                breathe easy.

                                JAMMER
                I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead.
                I thought... some of them... you know...

                                BUD
                I'm taking you back out.

                                JAMMER
                No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go
                any further in.

Bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized.  He looks at his
watch.  Checker Jammer's pressure gauges.

                                BUD
                Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here.
                I have to go there to the end... you'll see my
                lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold
                onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?

                                JAMMER
                Yeah, okay.  Okay.

He moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge
cylinders.  He pays out the lifeline as he goes.

INT. COM-ROOM                                                           77

Coffey is working rapidly and efficiently, moving from one rack of electronics
gear to the next, setting thermite grenades at vital points.  As the thermite
ignites, it generates an intense arc-bright light and tremendous heat.  The
circuit chasses melt.  Coffey works calmly in the infernal glare.

INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT                                                 78

Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the
missile compartment.  He goes down a stairwell to the lower level.  A HUNDRED
FEET AWAY, Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights.  He starts to get
nervous.  Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM, flickering lower and lower.
They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing.  The darkness
closes in.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  BUD?!  You readin' me?  BUD?!!

BUD, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet
lights, which are dimming and flickering.  He hears nothing from his helmet
transceiver.

JAMMER, smacks the side of his helmet.  Shakes the transceiver on his belt.
Nothing... just static.  Then even the static dies.  Panic time.

He grabs the safety line and pulls twice.  Hard.  It is snagged on a sharp
metal edge ten feet from him.  He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the
thing.  The line severs.  Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward
him.  His eyes bug.  He looks all around in the darkness.  Can't see Bud.
Can't decide what to do.  We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a
flywheel.

Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls.  It is a
cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights.

It grows brighter.  He turns slowly toward it.

The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of
cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.

                                JAMMER
                Bud?  Is that you?

C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source.

Guess what, Jammer?  It's not Bud.  In the brightest center of the glow,
SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls.
Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright
astonishment melting into terror.

The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically.  The shifting shadow falls across
Jammer.  He finally snaps out of his fixity...

Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand
through the treacherous wreckage.

His harness catches on a twisted pipe.

He struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic.

Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength.

He tears free of the entangling debris.  Launches like a torpedo... slamming
his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway.  His tri-mix
regulator takes the full brunt of the impact.

ON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position.  The strange
radiance is gone.  His dive light flare back to full brightness.

                                BUD
                Jammer?  Answer me, buddy,  JAMMER?!

He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place.  A seizure.
Bud grapples with him.

                                BUD
                Hang on, big guy.  Hand on!

Catfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later.  They
leap into the fray.

                                BUD
                He's convulsing!

                                CATFISH
                It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!

Then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with
the valves on his breathing gear.

                                FINLER
                Crank it down, man!  We're gonna losing him...

                                BUD
                SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!

                                SONNY
                You got it?!  You got it?

                                BUD
                Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

Jammer's convulsion ends.  He goes limp.

                                BUD
                We gotta get him out of here.  Come on!
                           (to Jammer)
                Hang on, buddy.

They drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly
back along the lifeline.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE & MONTANA SAIL                                        79

Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane.  Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power.

Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING
appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her!  It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse.  What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid,
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some
hallucinatory jet engine.  And it's hauling ass.

Lindsey jinks left.  The object jogs right.  She fights the control as her
sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.  K-BAM!  Her power comes
back up.  Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.  It pulls a high-G turn
and dives straight down.

We see the object zip behind Flatbed.  One Night can't see it.  The thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.

HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.  Her hands are shaking.  Suddenly
Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.

                                BUD (V.O.)
                CAB ONE!  CAB ONE!  Meet me at Flatbed!  This
                is a diver emergency!!  Do you copy?  Lindsey?!

She has a hard time focusing on what he's saying.  Finally...

                                LINDSEY
                Copy you, Bud.  On my way.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE INFIRMARY -- AN HOUR LATER                                80

Jammer is unconscious on a folding cot set up in the tiny cubicle of the
infirmary.  Monk, who is cross-trained as a medic as well as a demolitions
man, has hung an IV of something.  Bud and the SEAL are in the room, the
others hovering outside.

                                BUD
                Whattya think?

                                MONK
                I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching
                holes.  This type of thing... there's not much
                I can do.  The coma could last hours or days.

Bud, torn by guilt, gazes at the big man lying pathetically on the cot.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CONSOLE MODULE                                                     81

The SEALs, minus Monk, are all gathered inside, debriefing with DeMarco via
closed-circuit video.

                                DEMARCO (video)
                Did any of you see it?

                                COFFEY
                Negative.  But there was definitely a Russian
                bogey.  The Brigman woman saw it.

                                DEMARCO
                CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit.  Two Russian
                attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked
                within fifty miles of here... and now we don't
                know what the hell they are.  Okay, I don't have
                any choice.  I'm confirming you to go to Phase
                Two.

Wilhite and Schoenick glance uneasily at each other.

Coffey is silent.  He is vibrating with tension... his fists clenched to
prevent the shaking.  He is wrestling with the moment, knowing it is, in a
way, a point of no return.

                                DEMARCO
                Is there any problem?

                                COFFEY
                Yes... I mean no.  Negative, sir.

Coffey takes a deep breath.  Lets it out.  Phase Two is clearly a big deal.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B/DARKROOM                                         82

The maintenance room doubles as a camera workstation.  An adjoining head serves
as darkroom.  Lindsey is glumly reassembling Cab One's camera housings.

                                BUD
                Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or
                anything?

                                LINDSEY
                No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk
                about it.

                                BUD
                Fine.  Be that way.

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to
                call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a
                Russian submersible.  No problem.

                                BUD
                But you think it's something else.  What?  One
                of ours?

                                LINDSEY
                No.

                                BUD
                Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...

Lindsey is wrestling with a feeling which is somehow also certain knowledge.

                                LINDSEY
                Jammer saw something in there, something that
                scared the hell out him--

                                BUD
                His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and
                pranged his regulator.

                                LINDSEY
                But what did he see that made him panic?

                                BUD
                What do you think he saw?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!

Hippy comes pounding up, sticks his head in, gesturing animatedly.

                                HIPPY
                Hey, you guys... hurry up, check this out!
                They're announcing it.

They follow him into the corridor, trotting down to the mess hall.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          83

General melee as they rush in, everybody focused on the TV.

                                CATFISH

A LONG LENSE VIDEO SHOT of the Benthic Explorer and the other vessels in a
stormy sea CUTS TO a shot of BILL TYLER, the on-scene reporter, in rain
gear, clutching his microphone.  He is on the deck of a Navy support ship,
being used as a staging area from the press, well away from the center of the
operation.

                                TYLER
                --there is a tremendous amount of activity.
                With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup
                of US ships and aircraft in the area has drawn
                official protest from Havana and Moscow and has
                led to a redirection of Soviet warships into the
                Caribbean theater.

                                ANCHORMAN
                How would you describe the mood there?

                                TYLER
                The mood is one of suspicion, even confrontation.
                A number of Russian and Cuban trawlers,
                undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been
                circling within a few miles throughout the day,
                and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned
                away from the area...

Bud, Lindsey, and Hippy walking along the corridor, Hippy in a black mood of
incipient paranoia.

                                BUD
                What's the matter with you?

                                HIPPY
                Now we're right in the middle of this big-time
                international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile
                Crisis or something.

                                LINDSEY
                Figured that out for yourself, did you?

                                HIPPY
                We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit!
                Something goes wrong they could say anything
                happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals,
                know what I mean?

                                BUD
                Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women
                nervous.

                                LINDSEY
                Cute, Virgil.

                                HIPPY
                No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us
                diddly.  Something's going on.

                                BUD
                Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.

                                HIPPY
                Everything is.

One Night is pounding down the corridor from the sub bay.

                got me to show him the controls, then his guys
                suited up and they're rolling.

Bud breaks into a run, passing her.

                                BUD
                Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?

                                ONE NIGHT

Bud clears the door in time to see an empty moonpool, roiling with turbulence.
He runs to the edge and looks down.  Flatbed is a vague shape moving off.

                                BUD
                Unbelievable.

The sky is charcoal, the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes.  Waves
thunder over the foredeck, whipped by eighty-know winds.  Men in life
jackets scurry like insects.  Off the port bow, the ASW destroyer ALBANY
vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall.  McBride scream orders
that can't be heard to the crewmen on deck.  He staggers back along the bridge
railing.

INT./EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                87

McBride steps into the quiet of the control room.  He turns on De Marco.

                                MCBRIDE
                We're trying to get unhooked and get out of
                here... and your boys go sightseeing!

                                DEMARCO
                They'll be back in two hours.

                Two hours?!  We're gonna be getting the shit
                kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours!

De Marco's expression is infuriatingly calm... icy.  McBride looks at his
watch and swears under his breath.

                                                                CUT TO:

For a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated
by diver's lights.  Tiny figures, the divers move like moths around a distant
streetlight.  Wilhite, Monk and Schoenick are clustered around an open missile
hatch.  Using a large lift bag, they are removing the frangible fiberglass,
or 'diaphragm'.  Coffey pilots Flatbed with increasing deftness, deploying
the big arm to aid in the work.

DOWN ANGLE as the diaphragm lifts away... revealing the blunt nose of the
TRIDENT C-4 MISSLE.  Like looking down the barrel of a gun at the bullet
aimed right at you.

                the collision constituted an unprovoked attack.
                This was denied--

It continues.  Bud looks at Lindsey.  She turns to him, expression grim.

                Bud, this is big time.

Bud switches again.  Reception is getting worse as the storm affect the

It is now clear what the SEALs are doing.  Using large lift bags and Flatbed's
big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident C-4 missiles partway out of its
launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing
several of the MIRV warheads within.

Moving very carefully, Wilhite and Schoenick ease one of the individual MIRVs
out of its bracket.  Hanging under a lift-bag in a jerry-rigged harness, the
three-foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of Flatbed.

Flatbed surfaces in boiling foam.  The rig crew are all waiting.  Like a
crack pit-crew Bud's people leap onto Flatbed while its deck is still awash
and start to work on to Navy divers, unsealing their helmets and uncoupling
their umbilicals.  Hippy and Bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped
in one of the SEAL's gear bags.  Coffey emerges from the hatch.

                                COFFEY
                Don't touch that.  Just step away.  Now!

                Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.

The two SEALs unlash the object in the black bag.  Bud an Lindsey exchange a
glance.  He glares at Coffey as they pass each other.  One Night nimbly
climbs the hatch-tower and drops in.  Bud swings the heavy hatch up,
balancing it, and grins down at One Night.

                                BUD
                This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.

The big A-frame, massive as a railroad bridge, to which the umbilical from
the Explorer is attached.  Flatbed rises INTO FRAME arcing around the

As the ship slews, the umbilical is drawn off vertical.  It goes tight as a

Lindsey is in the corridor with a cup of tea when the whole rig BOOMS LIKE A

The winch man staggers along the railing, blasted by 80-knot winds.  He
sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical

going up to the winch-house.  As he climbs the winch's heave-compensator
slides up and down, FILLING FRAME behind him.

It is bottoming-out with a sound like a piledriver, overloaded by the strain

The deck is ripped upward as the entire 40-ton crane is pulled over by the
weight of Deepcore.  It topples in the launch well with a roar of tortured

tumbles between the twin hulls.  Trailing a vortex of foam and debris, it
roars down on us, FILLING FRAME WITH BLACKNESS.

The umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above, draping
itself over the habitat in large coils.  One Night pilots her submersible

She manages to get out from under it a keep going.

Through the front viewport they can see the coils of cable piling up in front
of the rig.  The hull booms with impacts as the massive stuff hits.

Everyone hold their breath as the sonar return-pings get closer... and
closer.  And closer...

An ENORMOUS SHAPE plunged into the floodlight in front of the rig.

K-WHAM!!  The 40-ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them.
A clean miss.  Much WHOOPING AND CHEERING.  Then...

The crane topples slowly over the back.  It rolls down the slope of the drop-
off, gathering speed.  Then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon.
The coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon.
And they're still attached.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh shit.

An agonizing few seconds.  Then... the cable pulls taut.

The rig begins to slide.  It tilts over the embankment and grinds down the

All hell has broken loose.  SIRENS, SCREAMING, a KLAXON HOOTING moronically.
Bud sprints from Control, bouncing off the corridor walls as the rig
lurches and tilts.  The lights go out.  Emergency light come on.  He trips
and falls, scrambles up, running on.

IN THE LADDERWELL of trimodule C, Lindsey runs toward the machine rooms.
K-BOOM!  A searing bright EXPLOSION in the electrical room.  Flames roar
through the doorway.  She dashed to a seawater hose hanging nearby and starts
to unroll it.  She sees Coffey and Schoenick in maintenance, lashing down
the mystery package.

Monk is working in a spray of seawater, turning valves to stop the flow of
ruptured pipes.  Behind him, a wall of flame blossoms through the door from

crushing his legs against machinery.  The fire roars into the room.

Hippy runs in.  The place is going nuts.  Water floods from the moonpool as
the rig tilts.  Wilhite is dancing across the deck, leaping over compressed-
gas cylinders which are rolling around loose.  Cab One jumps clear off its
cradle and slides SCREECHING across the deck.  Wilhite, running before the
12-tom juggernaut, had no place to go.  The SEAL dives into the churning
moonpool.  Cab One slams into the end wall, then spins and rolls toward
Hippy.

He starts to run.  Drop something.  Looks back.

Beany, in his zip-loc bag, is lying in the path of the slide submersible.
Hippy runs back.  Scoops up the baggie.  Cab One FILLS FRAME behind him.
He makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him,
buckling the steel doorframe.

Wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool.  He gets his fingers
over the top.  Pulls himself up...

A steel helium tank slams against his fingers, crushing them, and he falls
back.  More tanks bounce over the lip of the pool, hammering Wilhite down
into the foaming water.

He doesn't surface.

Lew Finler, Tommy Ray Dietz, and Lupton McWhirter fight their way toward the
door as the drill room floods rapidly.  Ahead, the big automated watertight
door is closing like a motorized bank-vault.  They reach it just as it is
closing, but can't prevail against the strength of the motors.  FROM THE FAR
SIDE, we can see them screaming soundlessly at the tiny pressure window in
the door.  We can hear the dull THUNK of their pounding.

Coffey and Schoenick, in emergency breathing masks, are fighting the fire with
a seawater hose and fire extinguishers.  Smoke and steam choke the dark
chambers.

Nearby, Lindsey grabs Hippy's arm as he is running past and drags him into the
blazing compressor room.  Hands him her seawater hose.  Wide-eyes, he starts
blasting everything in sight with water.

                                LINDSEY
                No! Hold it on me!

She rushed into the teeth of the fire as Hippy blasts her with a spray of
water, following her into the intense heat.  She grabs Monk, who is
semiconscious, and drags him out of the blazing room... Hippy dancing back
with the hose, tripping, blasting her in the face.

But it works.  They get Monk clear.

Bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the
drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the
trapped men.  He claws futility at the door.  The motors and the fail-safe
latching mechanism are on the opposite side.  Through the pressure window he
watches helplessly as they drown.  We don't see what he sees, but we know
what he sees.  Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing
torrent thunders in.  Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor.

He scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the
corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably.  He's
not going to make it.  He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through.
Grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with
the strength of this arms.  It doesn't work.  The steel door closes on the
fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.

But something amazing happens.  His wedding ring lodges between the door and
frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from
sealing and locking.

It resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing.

The freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear.

                                BUD
                Heeyy!!  HHHEEEYYY!!

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, Catfish and Sonny come pounding up.  They see
his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door.  Sonny wedges
a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry.  Catfish whips open his
jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator.  He is
sprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood.

Together they force open the door.  Bud is blown through in a torture of
water.  Sonny is thrown back into some pipes.  Breaks his arm.

Together they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow.
Catfish hammers the fail-safe latch home with the crowbar.

Bud lies gasping and shivering... staring at the tiny band of metal that
saved him.

                                SONNY
                Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read,
                over?  This is Deepcore--

                                BUD
                Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.

Bud walks down the corridor from control, slowly... as if carrying a great
weight.  The air is still thick with smoke.  The power off... everything
lit by emergency lights.  Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess
hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the
storage room across the hall.  Jammer is still unconscious.  Coffey and
Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table.  He is
conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted.

                                BUD
                Did you find Wilhite?

                                COFFEY
                No.

He and Bud lock eyes.  Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze
blames Coffey.  He turns away.

                                COFFEY
                Brigman.
                              (Bud turns)
                I was under orders.  I had no choice.

Coffey's manner is subdued, contrite.  A marked contrast to his previous
brusque arrogance.  He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the
tight brotherhood of a SEAL unit.  Bud's anger is not dispelled.  But he
can't address it now.  He moves on.

PAST THE INFIRMARY, where Sonny Dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken
arm.  He cries out in pain, cursing at himself.  LOOKING DOWN THE CENTRAL WELL
as Bud crosses.  Down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level
of the module is flooded.  Catfish is down there welding, sending shivering
reflections through the chamber.

INT. MACHINE ROOM                                                       120

Lindsey is working, up to her knees in water.  She is covered with grease,
tools scattered around.  Bud puts his hand on her shoulder.  She looks up,
blows some hair out of her eyes.

                                BUD
                What's the scoop, ace?

                                LINDSEY
                I can get power to this module and sub-bay if
                I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the
                mains, which are a total melt-down.

Rather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected
her in a different way.  She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done,
and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic.

                                BUD
                Need some help?

                                LINDSEY
                Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there
                won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple
                hours this place is going to be as cold as a
                meat locker.

                                BUD
                What about O-2?

                                LINDSEY
                Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth
                if we close off the sections we're not using.

                                BUD
                The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.

                                LINDSEY
                I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks
                outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go
                outside to tie onto them.

She goes back to her task, working efficiently with a socket wrench.

                                BUD
                Hey, Lins...
                          (she looks up)
                I'm glad your here.

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah?  Well I'm not.

The sub bay is still a mess.  Dark.  A few battery-operated lamps.  Flatbed
is back, floating in the moonpool.

One Night and Hippy are in deep concentration, piloting the two ROVs in a
damage survey of the rig.  Bud comes up behind them, check her screen first.
BIG GEEK'S MONITOR shows a view of the aft section of the rig.  The drilling
derrick had collapsed across Cab Three, totaling it.  A girder is jammed
through its acrylic front dome.

Little Geek rises up through the open central hatch, pivoting in a circle to
scan the flooded interior.

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, LITTLE GEEK'S POV.  The interior of the structure is a
shambles.  The lights of the little robot fall upon a figure... Perry.
Lying on the deck, almost looking like he's asleep.

                                HIPPY
                That's Perry.

                                BUD

                That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and

                Do we just leave him there?

                                BUD
                Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get
                something to breathe.

Catfish and Lindsey, in suits and helmets, drop down from the glare of the
moonpool onto the dark sea floor under the rig.  Walking, they pull their
umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage.  Little
Geek follows along like a dog at their heels.  They settle beside a valve
assembly at the base of the wrecked module.

                                LINDSEY
                Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some
                tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check
                them out.

                                CATFISH
                You watch yourself.

He begins to attach one end of a coiled-up high-pressure hose to a manifold.
She takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness.  Little
Geek goes with her faithfully.

Cab One is hanging from the overhead crane while One Nigh works to repair it.
Bud is nearby, tending hose for the divers and handing her tools.  Talking
while they work.  Hippy is across the moonpool running Little Geek.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.
                           (he hands it to her)
                So there you were--

                                BUD
                There we were, side by side, on the same ship,
                for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're
                testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we
                get back on the beach and... we're living
                together.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Doesn't mean you had to marry her.

                                BUD
                We were due to go back out on the same ship.
                Six months of tests.  If you were married you
                got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Okay, good reason.  Then what?

                                BUD
                It was alright for a while, you know.  But then
                she got promoted to project engineer on this
                thing, couple years ago.

                                ONE NIGHT
                She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for
                me, right there.  That's it.

                                BUD
                Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive--
                Son of a--!!

He's jammed his fingers with a wrench torquing down a bolt.  Whips his hand
out.

                                BUD
                She didn't leave me... she just left me behind.

She puts her arm around his shoulders, somehow managing to be fraternal,
maternal and suggestive all at the same time.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Bud, let me tell you something.  She ain't half
                as smart as she thinks she is.

She smiles and pretends to kink Lindsey's air-hose.

ACROSS THE CHAMBER, Hippy scowls as Little Geek's screen starts to go haywire
with interference.

                                HIPPY
                Hey, Lindsey, you reading me?  Over.

Catfish is working on one side of the wrecked module while Lindsey is on the
other, out of sight.  She is standing on the bottom at the base of the
wreckage, checking valves on a rack of oxygen bottles amongst the wreckage.
Right at the edge of the canyon wall.  Behind her is a sheer drop to
nothingness

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah, Hippy, I read you.  What's the matter?

The reply is GARBLED by a wash of static.  Then, for no apparent reason,
Lindsey's helmet light begins to dim out.  Little Geek's lights fade.  His
motors whine to a stop.

ON CATFISH, as his lights drop to candleglows.

The emergency lights are dimming, like a brownout.  Bud grabs the diver
intercom mike.

                                BUD
                Lins, how're you doing?  Lindsey?

ON LINDSEY, as she fiddles with her lights and transceiver pack.

                                LINDSEY
                Catfish... I got a problem here.  You there?
                Catfish?

Behind her, SOMETHING rises from the depths.

It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck.

It comes right up behind her.  She doesn't know it's there.  It hovers
sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look.  She
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her.  She turns
slowly.  We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate.

A more powerful glow washes up onto her from below.

Her eyes go down.  She gasps, absolutely stunned...

Above the edge of the wall, AN ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES SILENTLY OUT OF THE
DEPTHS.  Over sixty feet across.  It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.

Lindsey stand before it, unable to move.  Absolutely rapt.

Captivated by its ethereal beauty.  It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her.  She reaches up.  Touches it
as it passes over her.

Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.

The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.  She
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.

About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos.

She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and...

WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.  She pivots, trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a
meteor.  CLICK.  She get a shot a second before it disappears.

From around the flank of the rig module, Catfish appears.  Their com-sets
come backs to life, along with their lights.

                                LINDSEY
                You better not say you missed that.

                                CATFISH
                Missed what?

                                                                CUT TO:

TIGHT ON SLIDE STRIP.  Lindsey's fingertip in for scale.  The shot is black
with a little squiggle of light in the center.  Pathetic.

                                BUD
                Nice shot, Lins.

                                SONNY
                What is that?  You drop your dive light?

WIDER, SHOWING THE GROUP huddled around Lindsey who has her freshly-processed
slide roll laid out on the pinball machine, using it as a light table.

                                LINDSEY
                Come on, you guys... look, this is the little
                one right here.  You can see how it's kind of
                zigging around.

                                BUD
                If you say so.  It could be anything.

                                LINDSEY
                I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not
                hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting
                from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something
                down there.  Something not... us.

She looks around.  Sees a lot of skepticism in the eyes around her.

                                CATFISH
                Y'all could be more specific.

                                LINDSEY
                Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non-
                human, but intelligent...

                                HIPPY
                You mean like Coffey?

Lindsey is reddening.  Despite her conviction, this is really hard.

                                LINDSEY
                A non-terrestrial intelligence.

                                HIPPY
                Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I
                like that better then UFOs.  Although that
                works too... Underwater Flying Objects.

Hippy is not really mocking her.  He's actually into it.  But it has that
effect.  Catfish is eyeing Lindsey like he's never seen her before.

                                CATFISH
                Are we talkin' little space friend here?

                                HIPPY
                Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins?
                Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has
                known about them for years.  They abduct people
                all the time.  There was this woman I knew in
                Albuquerque who--

                                LINDSEY
                Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side.

Bud takes her firmly by the arm.  Heads her out into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, will you step into my office for a

He propels her along the corridor, away from the mess hall doorway.  They
face each other in the narrow space.

                here.

                                BUD
                Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation
                together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind
                of hysteria--

                                LINDSEY
                Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

They're talking across each other, not connecting.  Bud weary and frustrated.
Lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter.

                                BUD
                All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your
                fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.

                                LINDSEY
                I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there
                and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.

                God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.

                I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do
                I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of
                pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?

                                BUD
                No.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me
                better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my
                lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of
                them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like
                we would build... it glided.  It was the most
                beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Bud is stilled by her intensity.  She moves close to him.  Eyes alive and
luminous.

                                LINDSEY
                It was a machine, but it seems almost alive.
                Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to
                trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us
                harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a
                feeling.

                                BUD
                How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's
                going to go on you 'feeling'?

                                LINDSEY
                We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks
                and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear.
                Bud, you have to look with better eyes than
                that.

Bud has been taking this all in.  His eyes tracking her face.  He closes his
eyes, taking a deep breath.  It's so hard for him to do this, but...

                                BUD
                I can't, Lindsey.  I'm sorry.  How can I?

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MESS HALL -- LATER                                                 131

Coffey has Bud, Lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little
summit.  Lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self-imposed
exile.  They're all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves.  Their
breath shows in the air.

                                COFFEY
                I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar
                shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early
                warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.

                                LINDSEY
                          (rolling her eyes)
                Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three
                and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal
                trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking
                Russian.

Coffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke.

                                COFFEY
                            (to One Night)
                Why haven't you finished repairs on the
                hydrophone transmitter yet?

                                ONE NIGHT
                I was having my nails done.

Coffey is sweating, despite the chill.  Keeps his hands clenched in fists so
they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten.

                                COFFEY
                Get something straight.  You people are under my
                authority--

                                CATFISH
                Look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't
                take orders from you, and we don't much like you.
                In addition to which your momma dresses you
                funny.

Coffey's eyes are straight razors.  He slashes them from face to face.  You
can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation
in front of his own men.  Bud defuses it.

                                BUD
                'Fish'?

                                CATFISH
                Yuh?

                                BUD
                Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you
                handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see
                if you can get that transmitter working for me,
                okay?

                                ONE NIGHT
                Gimme a couple of hours.

HOLD ON COFFEY as everyone leaves.  Winding tighter.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B -- LATER                                        132

Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead.  They have a small port
removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an ELECTRONIC DETONATOR.  The
black box Lindsey glimpsed earlier.  As the two SEALs work like surgeons, we
see past Coffey's shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him, which looks
out into the perpetual blackness.  Something appears... a goofy shark face.

Big Geek rises silently in front of the port.  It moves a little, trying to
get a peek over Coffey's shoulder.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK                                           133

Hippy is twiddling his joysticks, watching the screen like a ferret.

                                HIPPY
                Come on... move to the left... just a little
                more... come on, A.J. Squared Away... that's
                it--

ON THE SCREEN, Geek's POV.  Coffey is blocking Hippy's view of whatever it is
they're working on.  Abruptly, be moves.  The warhead is lying there in plain
sight, detonator wires hooked up.  Hippy's eyes bug out.  He knows exactly
what it is.

                                HIPPY
                Pretty radical, guys.  Pretty radical.

He hurries to the VCR and puts it into RECORD.

INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK -- MINUTES LATER                          134

Video image of the SEALs working.  It FREEZES on a clear view of the warhead.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Say hello to MIRV.

Bud has his face right up to screen.  He frowns, skeptical.

                                HIPPY
                Come on, man.  What else could it be?

                                BUD
                Why bring it here?

                                HIPPY
                It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep
                it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the
                nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in
                the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot.
                Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

Bud whips around.  Lindsey, standing quietly in the doorway.  It's apparent
from expression she's been watching them for some time.  She looks ready to
kill somebody.  Then she's gone.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           135

Bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about
                it, I will.

                                BUD
                Lindsey!  Wait a second--

She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room B.  It's locked.  Before
Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-extinguisher off the wall and pounds on
the steel door like a big gong.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!

Needless to say, it opens.  She pushes past Schoenick, see the bomb lying
there naked.

                                LINDSEY
                You've got some huevos bringing this...
                thing... into my rig!  With everything that's
                been going on up in the world, you bring a
                nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone
                as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?

                                COFFEY
                You don't need to know the details of this
                mission... you're better off if you don't.

                                LINDSEY
                You're right... I don't.  I just need to know
                that this thing is out of here!  You hear me,
                Roger Ramjet?

                                COFFEY
                Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment
                to this mission.  I believe the stress is
                affecting you.
                            (to Schoenick)
                Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a
                tranquilizer.

Schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip.

                                LINDSEY
                Bullshit, you can't do that.  Oww... goddamnit!

Lindsey goes bananas, trying to get Schoenick's big hands off her arms.  Bud
slams his hand down on the intercom button.

                                BUD
                Emergency!  Maintenance room B.  Emergency!

He pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on Coffey... warning him
with a look that is not to be messed with.  Coffey is braced back against the
worktable... an odd stance, with one arm behind his back.  Suddenly there's
a crowd outside the door as Catfish, Hippy, One Night, and Sonny come running
up.  Confrontation time.

Sirens going.  About a million volts of electricity in the air.  Bud braces
Schoenick.

                                BUD
                Let her go.  Do it... right now.

He does.  Lindsey jerks away.  Rubs her arms.

                                LINDSEY
                You dumb jarhead motherf--

                                BUD
                Chill out, Lindsey!!

                                CATFISH
                What's the problem?

Everyone is frozen in place.  Bud a Coffey... snake and mongoose, glaring.
Bud pulls Lindsey back into the corridor.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  We were just leaving.
                              (to her)
                Weren't we?

ANGLE FROM BEHIND COFFEY, as Bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor.
Hands behind his back.  In his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the
.45.  He turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind.
he seems to sag.  When he looks at Schoenick, his eyes are wounds.  A hunted
animal.  Voice shaky.

                                COFFEY
                They can't be trusted.  They're turning against
                us.  We may have to take... steps.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           136

Lindsey, Bud, Hippy.  Bud slows, letting them trail behind the others.

                                BUD
                Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his
                hands?

                                LINDSEY
                He's got the shakes?

                                BUD
                Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off
                from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms
                of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a
                nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me...
                will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?

                                HIPPY
                Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about
                nine point five.

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                                 137

Coffey goes to the dome port.  Looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection
into the void.  Eternal night.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE.  Coffey's face in the window.  Stuck to the acrylic
bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws.  Coffey
stares out.  Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on,
spreadeagle and screaming.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY/DIVE-PREP AREA                                             138

Under a single worklight, a couple of conspirators.  Lindsey and Hippy hunch
over Big Geek.  The ROV grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, you can just punch into his little chip
                where you want him to go, and he goes, right?

                                HIPPY
                Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna
                be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just
                sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders
                through view of the camera, you'll get nada.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                      139

ONE SURVEILLANCE MONITOR.  Lindsey and Hippy next to Big Geek.  Their voices
are tinny but intelligible.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I don't know.  I really oughta talk to Bud about
                this.

E.C.U. COFFEY.  Watching them in the dark.  Alone.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then
                tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to
                Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off
                the button a little.

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more
                than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away
                goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple
                hours on this.

Coffey watches, his jaw clenched.

INT. QUARTERS/MESS HALL                                                 140

The lights are down.  Those who can are grabbing some sleep.  Snoring comes
from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes.  In the mess hall, Catfish and
Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets.  The cold has gotten
intense.  Water drips.  The walls sweat with condensation.  Lindsey can see
her breath as she makes coffee.  She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a
face in a pile of blankets.  A hand comes out, takes the coffee.

                                MONK
                Thanks.

Lindsey sips hers, staring.  Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless
pit.  She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping.  His soft
snoring downshifts into a loud rasp.  Lindsey touches him gently on the
shoulder.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, turn on your side.

Bud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response.  The snoring
stops.  It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two
have logged together.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        141

Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens.  Too comfortable.
He's asleep, chin on his chest.  On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost
imperceptibly faint trace appears.  A HUM, which is by now familiar, becomes
audible.  Sonny shifts in his seat.  Doesn't wake.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            142

Hippy puts his tools away, finished with the modifications to Big Geek.

                                HIPPY
                All set, big guy.  Hey, I told you to wipe that
                grin off your face.

He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door.  Switches off
the lights.  Goes out.

Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then...

A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending
shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to
pulsate.

Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering
pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an
amoebic mass shivering in the air.

It stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass
python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends,
stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip,
a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward,
as if it can see where it's going.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           143

Hippy trudges along the dark corridor.  He reaches the men's head and goes in.
As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor
B.G.  It 'looks' left and right.  Then extends the length of the corridor,
holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.

INT. TRIMODULE B/LADDERWELL/BUNKROOM/MESS HALL                          144

LOOKING DOWN three levels through the central ladderwell between the
cylinders.  The pseudopod enters and undulates upward.

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside.

Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious.  Jammer is still unconscious.  The
pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.

IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle
enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching.
It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying
everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head,
turning... sees the apparition next to her.

Her eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still
searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.

Bud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging
open like a total goon.

Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.

Catfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open
now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to
recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her.  She holds her ground, fascinated.

The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water,
still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise.
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression.
Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a
face, sticking out her tongue... testing it.

The liquid-Lindsey does the same.  Bud has just had the rug jerked out from
under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty
will, considering.

                                BUD
                            (whispering)
                I think it likes you.

                                LINDSEY
                It's trying to communicate.

Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's.

She reaches out her hand slowly.  Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface.
Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.

Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's
dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.  She draws her wet
fingers out and studies them, amazed.  Touches one fingertip to her tongue.

                                LINDSEY
                Seawater.

The pseudopod pulls back from her.  It loops in the air dramatically, full
circle... and ties itself into a knot.  As the knot tightens down, it melts
back into the body.  The 'disappearing knot' trick.

Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a
magic show.  She is transported.

                                LINDSEY
                Show off.

She looks at Bud.  He grins broadly.  He's with her now.

The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room.  Out to the
corridor

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            145

Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area.  They see
the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk.  Coffey's mind is
blown.  We can smell the insulation burning.  He just stares.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        146

The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead.  It studies
the device for a few seconds.  Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in
time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead.  They begin to lift it off its cart.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            147

Coffey finally jump-starts his brain.  In a flash of insight, he runs to the
big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor.  He
and Schoenick heave on the door.  Like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it.

VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the
body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor.  It reverts to
nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve,
the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.  ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE
DOOR, however, the "stump" rears back like a cobra.  It withdraws rapidly into
the moonpool.  The glow fades away.

INT. SONAR SHACK                                                        148

Sonny wakes up with a start as the HUM revs up into a LOUD WHINE and then
fades away.  He scrambles to track it.  Too late.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           149

Hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the
length of the corridor.  He missed the whole thing.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          150

Light on.  Everybody there.  Lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now
that she's been proven right.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a
                Russian water-tentacle.  Lieutenant?  No?  Well,
                a breakthrough.

Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in "The Shining".
Bud give her a warning look.  Don't poke at the rattler.

                                BUD
                You done impressing yourself, ace?

                                ONE NIGHT
                No way that could just be seawater.

                                LINDSEY
                They must've learned how to control water... I
                mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize
                it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under
                intelligent control.

                                BUD
                Maybe their whole technology is based on that.
                Controlling water.

Coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees.  His hands are out of sight.  His
arm is moving in a slow rhythm.  We can't see what he's doing.

                                HIPPY
                That thing was probably their version of Big
                Geek... like an ROV.

                                CATFISH
                Just checking is out, huh?  How come?

ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE, showing what Coffey is doing.  He has his K-BAR KNIFE
gripped white-knuckle in one hand.  He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly
across the skin of the other forearm.  Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to
elbow.

C.U. COFFEY -- He doesn't flinch.  His eyes are hard and bright as diamond
drills.  No one notices.  He's keeping the edge.

                                LINDSEY
                They're curious, maybe.  We could be the first
                people they've seen up close.

                                SONNY
                Hope they don't judge the whole race offa us.

                                CATFISH
                Maybe I oughta shave.

Coffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking
through the group as if they were smoke.  This cold behavior brings the mood
down a notch.

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B                                        151

Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume.
Bright speculation, a few jokes.  Coffey is visible shaking.  Breathing hard.
Pupils dilated.  Schoenick looks at him with concern.

                                COFFEY
                It went straight for the warhead.  And they
                think it's cute.

                                SCHOENICK
                You need to get some sleep.

Coffey walks away without hearing him.  Schoenick catches up.

INT. MAINTENANCE                                                        152

The door opens in the dark room.  Coffey enters, moving with purpose.  He
pulls his gear bag out from under the work table.  Unzips it.  Pulls out a
short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle.

                                COFFEY
                We have no way of warning the surface.  Do you
                know what that means?

Schoenick doesn't know.  He hopes Coffey knows.  Because he's a fearless man
who's discovering what it is to be afraid.  Coffey inserts the magazine with
a CLACK!  Snaps the bolt.  Tosses the rifle to Schoenick.

                                COFFEY
                It means... whatever happens is up to us.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE -- LATER                                      153

Hippy passes the maintenance room.  Looks in.  The warhead and its cart are
missing.  He looks around.  Heads toward the sub-bay.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          154

The discussion, still in progress.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You think they're from down there originally?
                Or from... you know.

She jerks her thumb toward the ceiling.

                                LINDSEY
                I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place
                that has similar conditions... cold, intense
                pressure.  No light.

                                CATFISH
                Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.

INT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY                                                   155

Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from
the sub-bay.  He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the
steel floor.  Slides up along the wall next to the door.  Inches his eye
around the doorframe.  Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall,
lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart.  He
begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps.

Hippy lets his breath out slowly.  His expression is Holy Shit.

He slides back along the corridor wall, silently.  Away from the door.  Then
turn turns quickly to go... WHAM!  Coffey slams him up against the wall!
.45 pressed to Hippy's temple.  Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the
hammer.

                                COFFEY
                Sniff something did you, rat boy?

INT. MESS HALL                                                          156

The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted
inside.  His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face.
Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45.  Schoenick flanks him
with the assault rifle aimed at the group.

                                COFFEY
                FREEZE!  Don't move.  That's it.
                              (to Monk)
                Here, hold this a second.  We're going to phase
                three.

He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team
member.  Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol.  We can't tell what
he's thinking.  Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair.

                                HIPPY
                They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the
                NTIs!  We set it up to go right to them.

Lindsey looks stricken.  Her plan is betraying them all.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh my God...  Oh no...
                        (steps toward Coffey)
                Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what
                you're doing... for God's sake--

Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering.

Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke
machine, pinning her there with one hand.  Bud leaps forward.

                                SCHOENICK
                GET BACK!

Bud freezes.  The rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot.

Coffey moves up close to Lindsey.

                                COFFEY
                This is something I've wanted to do since I
                first met you.

His hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.  We hear something RIP.  His hand comes
back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape.

He slaps it over her mouth.  Then pushes her down into a chair.

Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick.

                                HIPPY
                You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's
                fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and
                we're all ringside!

                                MONK
                What's the timer set for?

                                SCHOENICK
                Three hours.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  Don't talk!

                                MONK
                We can't get to minimum-safe-distance in three
                hours.  The shockwave will kill us.  It'll crush
                this rig like a semi driving over a beer can.

                                COFFEY
                Shut up!  SHUT UP!  What's the matter with you?!

Everybody is twitching a hyper.  Schoenick is white-knuckling his assault
rifle... looking from Monk to Coffey to the group.

                                COFFEY
                Just stay calm.  The situation is under control.

Coffey backs out quickly with Schoenick.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           157

Coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into
the mechanism so it can't be opened.

                                COFFEY
                Stay here.

Schoenick take a position in front of the door.  Coffey turns and runs through
the corridor like demons are chasing him.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          158

Their only hope is to sway Schoenick.  But the SEAL's fear is making him the
perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders.  And his orders are
clear.  They can see him through the tiny window in the door.  Lindsey rips
the tape painfully off her mouth.

                                LINDSEY
                Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make
                a real bad career move...

                                HIPPY
                That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!

                                BUD
                We have to stop him!  Schoenick!!

They pound on the door.  Schoenick turns and hangs his cap over the tiny
window.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            159

Using the chainfall, Coffey maneuvers the completed Geek/MIRV package over
the back of Flatbed, obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it
out and launch it.

INT. MESS HALL                                                          160

Lindsey is up next to the door, with Bud.

                                LINDSEY
              ... he's about to declare war on an alien species,
                Schoenick, just when they're trying to make
                contact with us.
                                (to Bud)
                I think I'm reaching him.

There is a CLUNK-CLATTER and the door unlatches.

                                LINDSEY
                See?

The door opens.  Jammer is standing there.  Schoenick is in a heap against
the far wall, moaning.  Jammer hands the rifle to Hippy as he walks in.  Hippy
turns to cover the other SEAL.  Monk puts his hands up, passively.

                                MONK
                I'm the least of your problems.

Bud appraises Jammer, who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay.

                                BUD
                Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?

                                JAMMER
                Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that
                angel comin' toward me.

They all look at him for a second.  What?

                                BUD
                Uh, okay, right.  You can tell us about it
                later.  Let's go.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL                                             161

Bud drops down the ladder, INTO FRAME, followed by the others.  He tries the
door into the main corridor.  The wheel won't turn.  The others get on it.
Won't budge.

                                BUD
                He's jammed the mechanism.

                                LINDSEY
                Now what?

They're locked in trimodule-C.  No other doors give access to the sub-bay
corridor.  Bud's mind is racing.  He drops down the ladder to Level One, into
about two feet of water.  He reaches down and open the emergency lockout
hatch.  Takes off his boots.

                                BUD
                Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get
                inside, get the door open from the other side.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above
                freezing.

                                BUD
                Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

Catfish is pulling his boots off as well.

                                CATFISH
                Wish us luck.
                       (hands his wallet to Hippy)
                'Case I don't die.  Okay, Bud... let's go,
                podner, I ain't got all day.

Bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating.  He drops into
the water.

EXT. DEEPCORE/TRIMODULE C                                               162

Bed shoots down through the hatch.  The cold hits him list a fist, becoming
instantly paralyzing.  He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel.
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell.  They reach hatch six.  Together
they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it.

INT.  TRIMODULE D/LEVEL ONE                                             163

Bud surges up into the lock.  Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him.
They try the upper hatch.  Jammed.  They're both panting with the exertion
and intense cold.

                                BUD
                Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.

                                CATFISH
                I can't... make it... podner.

Bud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed.

                                BUD
                Okay, Cat.  You head back.

Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           164

Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit.  He sees the
lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            165

In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of
Flatbed.  His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey
uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking
the Geek/MIRV in its gripper.

Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the
water onto the deck of the pool.  He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle.
His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold.  His fingers are
completely numb.  He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits.
Scans the situation.  He can't get to the door, which is across the room,
without Coffey seeing him.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     166

Lindsey watching the whole thing going down, ON THE SCREEN, a high angle of
the sub bay... Bud moving up on Coffey.

                                HIPPY
                He can't get to the door... I think he's going
                to try and take him himself.

                                LINDSEY
                He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained
                killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling
                One Night over laundry duty.

ON THE SCREEN, Bud picks up a piece of pipe.  Hefts it.  Moves forward,
crouched... stalking.  Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration.

                                LINDSEY
                BUUUUUD!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            167

Bud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then
wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees,
taking him down.  Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor
kick that topples him.

Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water.

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself
out, hoping to make it to the door.

Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs.

He pulls himself up as Bud kick out.  Claws his way viciously over Bud's
body until he has him pinned to the deck.  Then he pulls out the .45.

Put it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     168

                                LINDSEY
                NOOO!!

INT. SUB BAY                                                            169

Coffey pulls the trigger... CLICK.  Bud flinches, then opens his eyes,
staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the .45.  Coffey cocks it and tries
again.  CLICK.  Nothing.  Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls
the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against
a rack of equipment.  They face off, panting.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     170

The rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monk's voice.

                                MONK
                I tool the liberty of removing this before I
                gave it back to him.

Monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from
the .45.

INT. SUB WAY                                                            171

Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked.  Coffey's really trying to put him out
of business.  It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part.  Throw a few things.
When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard.  Give him credit, though.  He
manages to scramble back up.

The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear.

Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor.

Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks.

Slams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door.

But the Navy man is just too massive.  Bud is hammered back into a wall.
Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace.  Spins around at the
sound of a VOICE.

                                CATFISH
                Hey!

Catfish is right behind him.  Dripping wet.  A trail of water goes back to
the moonpool a few feet away.

CRACK!  Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is
knocked right on his ass.  He doesn't get up.  Just sort of flops around.

Catfish helps Bud to his feet.  They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles
sideways, his eyes rabid.

He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them.  As they duck he sprints to
Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.

                                BUD
                           (to Catfish)
                Get the door!

Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed.  The hatch is already sealed.
He grapples with Geek/MIRV, trying to free it from the steel claw.

INT. FLATBED                                                            172

Coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilot's compartment.  He claws
his way into the control seat and starts rapidly flipping switches.

INT. CORRIDOR                                                           173

Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut
doing a rumba.  He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins
the wheel.  Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach.
Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle.  John Wayne.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            174

Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water.  Bud
is being dragged down, still trying to free the ROV.  He gives up when he
sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo.

Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool.

Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his
viewing bubble beneath the swirling water.  Coffey looks up, stares at the
gun... doesn't seem to care.

                                CATFISH
                SHOOT!

Hippy's squeezing the trigger and nothing's happening.  Flatbed's hatch tower
goes under.

                                CATFISH
                Safety's on!  On the side... the lever!  Up,
                push it up!

Hippy fumble with the selective-fire lever, BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!  He put three
quick rounds into the ceiling.

                                HIPPY
                SHIT!

                                CATFISH
                Give me that!!

He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub.  He racks the water
with a long burst.  BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails
through the water.  They barely scar the front port.

                                LINDSEY
                Forget that... go for Big Geek!

Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the
shimmering shape of the ROV on its back.  UNDERWATER we see the rounds
arcing wild, a few hitting the ROV but causing little damage.

Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor.  ABOVE, Catfish
empties the weapon.

                                BUD
                Gimme a hand!

They all turn.  Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman.  The others
rush over to help him.

                                BUD
                Get the rest of my gear.  Grab that hat there...
                let's go guys!  Come on, come on!

Catfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and
hose connections.  Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and
buckling all over him.  This is a world-record suit-up time.  Bud pulls the
rubber neck-dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face.

                                BUD
                Helmet... helmet!  Work fast.

EXT. DEEPCORE UNDERSTRUCTURE                                            175

Beneath the habitat, Coffey is maneuvering Flatbed through the twisted pipe
and debris left by Deepcore's slide to the edge.  Bloodied, his fatigues
ripped half-off, he looks like a feral animal.  His eyes burn with the
determination of his mission.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            176

Jammer expertly works the crane controls, moving Cab One out over the
moonpool from its drydock cradle.  Lindsey and One Night are scrambling like
monkeys over the port side crash bars of the swinging sub, clambering up to
the hatch tower.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I'll unhook.
                           (Lindsey hesitates)
                GO!  You're better in these than I am.

Lindsey recognizes this for what it is... a sign of respect, a
reconciliation.  She nods and drops through the hatch.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           177

Coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes
a tight turn beneath the drill-floor module.  Flatbed scrapes through between
twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal.

INT. SUB BAY                                                            178

Bud has his 'hat' locked down and his air cut on.  He take two quick strides
to the edge of the pool and just drops in.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           179

Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles.  He looks around.  Through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern.  Bud see a shortcut under the platform.

He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-
hand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.

Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing
behind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub.

Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.

LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.
Hovering.

ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.

INT./EXT. FLATBED                                                       180

Coffey works intently.  His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a
face streaked with blood.  He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.

GEEK/ROV had a passenger.  Brigman.  The diver is holding Geek's skid with
one hand, doing something with the other.  He turns to look at Coffey.

EXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE                                                   181

Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the
steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud
kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie
one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending
an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its
load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.

Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is
hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV
strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping
as Bud fights to make a knot.

Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face.

Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.

The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An
enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.

The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud.

Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming.

Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as
Coffey closes the last few feet.

One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside
rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of
pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!!

INT. FLATBED                                                            182

Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port.  He
gets back in the seat.  Strains to free his machine.

EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED                                          183

Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in
Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.
It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him.

Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO.
DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon
line starts to play through the knot slowly.

BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to
side, up or down.

Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,
blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full
throttle.

At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible
slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey
looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She
cruises up over Bud.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                Get in!

Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       184

Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut.  He ditches his helmet.
Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.  Through the front port
there is not sign of Coffey.

                                LINDSEY
                You owe me one, Virgil.

                                BUD
                Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.

He points.  Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at
its leash.  Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to
open her own small manipulator claws.

EXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC.                                                185

The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.

Big Geek happily surges forward.  It dives gracefully down into the void,
trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.

ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.

                                BUD
                Go after it!  We gotta catch it!

FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are
slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full
throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his
more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.

She arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She
fights for control.

INT./EXT. CAB ONE                                                       186

Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.  Lindsey flies with her
jaw set.  Fighting hard for control.  The A-frame of the rig looms before her.
She shoots through at full throttle.

EXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN                                         187

Now the fight is really on.  The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical
modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.

Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.

They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.

Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that.

Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.

Lindsey rises, cuts right.

Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in
the rocks.

Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.

It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.

Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's
tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.

INT. FLATBED                                                            188

Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control.

He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge.  As the
pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with
the enormous load.

A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows.
Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit.

The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.

Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes
into him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a
bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.

EXT. CANYON WALL                                                        189

Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.

Soon its lights vanish.

INT. CAB ONE                                                            190

They're both going to have a lot of bruises...

Lindsey is surveying the damage.  Water is spraying down on them like a
shower, and lights are flickering.

                                LINDSEY
                You did okay, back there.  I was fairly
                impressed.

                                BUD
                Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

                                LINDSEY
                Not in this thing.

Lindsey is flipping switches.  Nothing works.

                                BUD
                You totaled it, huh?

                                LINDSEY
                Yeah.  So sue me.

Bud looks down.  There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the
floor at their feet.

                                BUD
                It's flooding like a son of the bitch.

                                LINDSEY
                You noticed.

She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.

She waits.  No response.

                                BUD
                Try again.

                                LINDSEY
                Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance,
                over.  Deepcore, this--

With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything
goes black.

                                LINDSEY
                Well, that's that.

                                BUD
                Wonderful.
                          (looking around)
                There's some light from somewhere...

A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port.
Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                Over there.  It's the rig.

A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the
hill in the desert.

                                BUD
                Good hundred yards, I'd say.

                                LINDSEY
                They'll come out after us.

                                BUD
                Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find
                us.  We better get this flooding stopped.

He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light.  Using the thing like a bulky
flashlight.  The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower...
almost two feet deep already.

                                LINDSEY
                You see where it's coming in?

                                BUD
                Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.

She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by
a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.

                                BUD
                Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off.
                You go any tools?

                                LINDSEY
                I don't know, look around.

Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water.  It's past his
knees.

                                BUD
                Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn
                crescent wrench.

He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench
it off the wall.  Heaves on it repeatedly.  Finally stops, panting.  He's
breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch!

                                LINDSEY
                Calm down, Bud.

A nervous edge in her voice now.  Bud's turning all around, looking around
for anything, trying to think fast.  Water up to their waists.  The sea
closing in.

                                BUD
                Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.

                                LINDSEY
                How?

                                BUD
                I don't know how!

                                LINDSEY
                We've only got one suit.

                                BUD
                I know!  I know!  But we better come up with
                something.

                                LINDSEY
                Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling,
keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water.  She's
shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water
pouring in.

                                LINDSEY
                Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back
                with another suit.

                                BUD
                Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough
                time.  Look at this...
                       (the rate of flooding)
                Time I get back you'll be--

That stops the conversation for a second.  About two feet of airspace left.
Bud can't believe what this is coming down to.  They both stare at each other
for a long moment.

He makes a decision.  Starts pulling off his backpack.

                                BUD
                Alright, put this on.

                                LINDSEY
                What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You
                got it on, keep it on.

                                BUD
                Don't argue, goddamnit, just--

                                LINDSEY
                No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

Bud has his pack off uncoupling it.  She keeps fighting his hands, stopping
him, hooking it back up.  The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.

                                BUD
                Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--

                                LINDSEY
                NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--

                                BUD
                FUCK LOGIC!!

They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests.
Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.

                                LINDSEY
                Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?
                You're for the suit on and you're a better
                swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...

                                BUD
                What's the plan?

                                LINDSEY
                I drown, you tow me back to the rig--

                                BUD
                WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??

Lindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide.  But she's keeping
it together.  Thinking it out.  Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her
and he can barely think.

                                LINDSEY
                Look, this water is only a couple degrees above
                freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia...
                my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived
                after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the
                stuff to do it on the rig.

Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him.  The water is up
to their necks.  He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.

                                BUD
                It is insane.

                                LINDSEY
                It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

She takes a deep breath.  Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his
suit, rehooking everything.

                                BUD
                Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.

She raise his helmet.  Water up to their chins.  They lock eyes, inches
apart.  He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.

                                BUD
                Oh God, Lins... I--

                                LINDSEY
                Tell me later.

He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his.  They lock
together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked
realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.

She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet
over his head.  Seats is down over the neck ring.  Lock the bail-out handle,
sealing it.  Even with her head press up into the highest point of the
ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water.  She give a scared little
laugh.

                                LINDSEY
                This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?

She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.  Puts her face to
the glass of his helmet.  Seconds to go.

                                LINDSEY
                Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...

He can't hear her, but he read her lips.  They clutch each other desperately.
The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose.  She starts
to choke.  Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes.
Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.

                                BUD
                NOOOOO!!!

The freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her
hands float lifelessly.

Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open
mouth.  He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of
the lockout hatch.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE                                            191

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, one of the outside cameras.  A ghostly figure swims out
of the darkness, towing something.

                                ONE NIGHT
                It's Bud.  Oh my God... that's Lindsey!

                                BUD (V.O./faint)
                Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read?

                                HIPPY
                Read you, Bud.  We're here.

EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           192

Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey.  Her arms and legs float
as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current.  Bud's voice comes in
short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.

                                BUD
                Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...
                de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc
                syringe... and some... heating blankets.
                You got all that?

                                HIPPY (V.O.)
                Got it. Over.

                                BUD
                Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.

INT. INFIRMARY                                                          193

The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in.  He picks up the CPR cart, meant
to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who
are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment.  They ransack the place in
about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything
else.

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER THE MOONPOOL                                        194

Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving
platform.  Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,
looking down.

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            195

Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things,
making mistakes.  One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a
bottle of adrenaline.

                                SONNY
                Here he comes!

Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged
diving platform.  Bud bursts to the surface.  Together they haul Lindsey
across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck.  Her skin is blue-
white, her chest still.

Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a
mission.  The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see
Lindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert.  Water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp.  Hippy peels back one
eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.

But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.

                                BUD
                Turn her over!

They flip his wife's body over.  He straddles her, pushing down with both
hands in the middle of her back.  Seawater gushes from her slack lips.  He
does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.

                                BUD
                Come on, hurry!  Gimme the de-fib...

One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment.  They've
all been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a
friend they're working on.  They're all thumbs.  Catfish drops the electrodes,
picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...

                                CATFISH
                Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare
                skin, or it won't...

Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her
T-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.

                                BUD
                Jesus.  Gimme those, come on.  Catfish, move it,
                man!  Come on... come on!

He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on
the side of the rib cage.

                                BUD
                Is that it?  Is this right?

                                HIPPY
                Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.

                                BUD
                All right.  Do it!

One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses.  It is a pure muscle
reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life.  Hippy pushes him
back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth.  He opens the valve
on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag.  They start packing
electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia

                                BUD
                Do it again, One Night.  Zap her again!

The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches.  Bud doesn't wait for a
result... he's in his own reality now, driven.  He's doing it all at once,
somehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands,
squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.

                                BUD
                Aw.  Christ... come on, baby.  Again!  Do it
                again!

Lindsey's back arches.  Her body relaxes, inert.

                                BUD
                Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?

A hush seems to have fallen over the group.  They know instinctively that it's
over.  But Bud can't accept it.  He looks at them, beseechingly, like they
are somehow intentionally holding out on him.  One Night starts to cry,
quietly.

                                CATFISH
                                (gently)
                Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.

There is a beat of silence.  Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open,
motionless eyes.

TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.

REVERSE, HER POV.  SILENCE.  A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One
Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down.  It is like the circular top of
a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water.  It is
as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing
smaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes
a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a
turned-off TV.

TIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring.  Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder.
Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman,
renewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.

                                BUD
                No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong,
                she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come
                on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do
                it... DO IT!

They do.  And Bud works, feverishly.  He lock his lips over hers and starts
mouth-to-mouth.  It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.

                                BUD
                Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you
                never backed down from anything in life... now
                fight!

He slaps her face, hard.  Her head lolls.  He smacks her the other way.

                                BUD
                Fight, Goddamnit!

LINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well.  The circles of faces and
light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit.  We
see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.

                                BUD
                FIGHT!!

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, still.  Then something incredible happens.  Something they
will never forget as long as they live.  Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her
hands clench in a spasm.

Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific.

                                BUD
                Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your
                way back, baby...

The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.

She starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air
into her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-
establish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking
and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.

Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized
breath.  He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands,
and watches her breathe.  Color is returning to her skin as she lies there,
gasping weakly.

ONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're
all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth.

ON BUD... tears are streaming down his face.

                                BUD
                   (a whisper, fierce and harsh)
                You did it, ace.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/QUARTERS -- LATER                                         196

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully.  WIDER shows Bud hovering over her,
attentive.  They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle.  Perhaps twenty minutes
have passed.  She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face,
and looks like a waif.

Lindsey's eyes flutter and open.  The first thing she sees is Bud, bending
over her.  He can't help himself.  The tears break again and roll down his
cheeks.  She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware.  She smiles,
faintly... touches his cheek.

                                LINDSEY
                Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?

                                BUD
                Hi, lady.

                                LINDSEY
                Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?

                                BUD
                'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you?
                How d'you feel.

                                LINDSEY
                I've been better.  Next time it's your turn,
                okay?

Bud's expression turn inexplicably grim.

                                BUD
                Well, you got that right.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. SUB-BAY                                                            197

TIGHT ON BUD'S EYES, as Monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his
eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet.

WIDER reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit.  Everybody is grouped
around, buckling and zipping.  He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask,
part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing.  Monk,
on his stretcher, is presiding.  The resident expert.  Lindsey is wrapped in a
blanket, still looking wan and frail.  She doesn't have the strength to resist
Bud's will, but she's trying.

                                LINDSEY
                No, Bud, no... not you.

                                BUD
                Who then?

She looks around at the others.  Sees their eyes.  The fear.  Has her answer.
He lowers the helmet over his head.  Catfish clamps it down.  We see what's
driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being
able to prevent this situation.

He touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling.
Then he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's
forearm.  Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.

                                BUD (muffled)
                So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?

                                MONK
                The fluid prevents your larynx from making
                sound.  It'll feel a little strange.

                                BUD (muffled)
                Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.
                              (a beat)
                The moment of truth, huh?

His breathing is shallow and tense.  He looks at Lindsey.  The eyes of a
condemned man.  She squeezes his hand.  He takes a deep breath.

                                BUD
                Okay.  Let's rock and roll.

Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line.  The breathing fluid (3M
fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet.  Bud reflexively raises
his chin.  The liquid fills toward his mouth.

                                MONK
                Relax now, Bud.  Just keep breathing as it
                fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let
                yourself take it in.

Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.  His eyes go wide,
instant panic.  He starts to thrash.  Chest heaving.

                                MONK
                Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll
                pass in a second.  You're gonna be okay.  We all
                breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body
                will remember.

Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him.  He finds her eyes, the look
calming him.  He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.
His spasms subside.  He begins to "breathe" normally.  He gets a goofy look
of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is
alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins.
Gives a big thumbs up.  Lindsey picks up a microphone.

                                LINDSEY
                Can you hear me okay?
                          (another thumbs up)
                Try your keypad.

Bud taps out a brief message.  FEELS WEIRD - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS prints out
on their portable monitor.

                                LINDSEY
                I already have, moron.

They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform.  Jammer and Hippy lower Little
Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it.  Hippy yells right up next to his
helmet.

                                HIPPY
                I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek!
                He should take you right to it.  All you gotta
                do is hang on!

Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge.

He looks up at her as he drops away.

In a few seconds, she can't see him.  Her chin quivers, minutely.

EXT. DEEPCORE/THE WALL                                                  198

FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness.
A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts
down.  It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.

He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.

Bud looks down.  Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the
glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness.  The wall
unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery.  He looks
up.  The lights of Deepcore are gone.  He feels  more alone than he has ever
felt.  He types out:  CANT SEE YOU

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                We're right here with you, Bud.  Your depth is
                3800 feet.  You're doing fine.

Bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall
like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     199

Everyone is grouped around the monitor screen, watching Bud's telemetry.  Bud
types out: GOOD DEAL ON SLIGHTLY USED CRANE.  They watch the depth meter
counting down.

                                MONK
                4800 feet.  It's official.

                                LINDSEY
                Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record
                for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think
                you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.

The screen print out:  CALL GUINESS.  They laugh.  So far so good.  Seconds
later...

                                HIPPY
                One mile down and still grinnin'.

WIDE SHOT.  Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little
pool of light.  The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth.
LOOKING DOWN, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness
yawning below.

INT. COMMAND MODULE                                                     201

Lindsey has the microphone gripped tightly, and the lightness in her voice is
a bit brittle.

                                LINDSEY
                8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?

                                MONK
                Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision
                problems, euphoria.

                                LINDSEY
                Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.

ON THE SCREEN, printing out: COLD.

                Big baby.

Then:  HANDS SHAKING.  HHARD TO TYPE.

                                MONK
                It's starting.  It hits the nervous system
                first.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Keep talking, Lindsey.  Just let him hear your
                voice.  It doesn't matter what about.

                                LINDSEY
                Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling
                as well as sentence structure, so concentrate,
                okay?
                              (long pause)
                Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say.
                It's hard for me.  I'm not of those softy, gooey-
                center-type people.  It's not easy, you know,
                being a cast-iron bitch.  It takes discipline
                and years of training.  A lot of people don't
                appreciate that.

Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room.  In her mind she is
with Bud, out in the darkness.

                                LINDSEY
                But is wasn't all bad.  I know that.  You
                remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda
                up through Oregon?  It took me a week to get my
                hair untangled, but I've never been happier.  It
                was the most... free... I've ever felt.  I'm
                sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.

Bud is visibly trembling, gritting his teeth... holding on as the vise-grip
of pressure takes him.

                                LINDSEY (V.O./filtered)
                It's pitiful.  I have to wait until you're
                freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand
                feet of water between us.  I guess I'm babbling.
                I'm sorry.

Bud struggles with his keyboard.

BLAM!  Bud jerks as his dive light implodes.  He still has Geek's floodlights.
He falls on.

                Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?

He types: SE LUMINUS THINNGS

Everyone snaps suddenly alert.

                                HIPPY

                Maybe it's... you know... them.

The screen prints out:  ITS OK. SQUID. GLOWING SQUID.

Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated
creatures less than a foot long.  Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs
around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see.  He stares at
them in wonder.  Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go.  Are
they really here?  He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.

Bud emerges from the school of squid.  As he falls, they form a luminous plane
of swirling colors above him.  He stares upwards, transfixed.  BUD'S POV, the
ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him.  A spectral form takes shape in
the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide.
Gazing down at him, her expression sad.  Her image receded away from him into
the darkness above as he falls.

DOWN ANGLE ON BUD, reaching up in anguish.

                I'm not going away, Bud.  I'm right here, right
                here with you.  This is Lindsey, Bud.  I'm right

the group lit only by the ghostly CRT screen.

Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy.  His eyes keep rolling back, and
he's having a hard time staying conscious.  He tries to type a message and he
can't.  The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous
system.  Suddenly K-BAM!  Little Geek's pressure hull implodes.  Its lights
go out.  BLACKNESS.

Lindsey seems not to be in the room, but to be with him, seeing what he sees.
She is oblivious to the others.

Blackness.  Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.

It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge.  Bud discards the stalwart
little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute.  Out of control, he
hits a ledge and rolls off.  Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris.  He hits
another outcropping, limp as a rag doll.  Rocks and sand rain down with him
as he continues his descent.

Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.

He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.

In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to
the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of
air and light.  Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.

                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
                You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,
                you probably don't remember... the power went
                out at the old apartment, the one on Orange
                Street... and we were staring at that one little
                candle, and I said something really dumb like
                that candle is me, like every one of us is out
                there alone in the dark in this life...

TIGHT ON LINDSEY as she grips the microphone.  Her voice has become a hoarse
whisper.  Her eyes are intense, focused on a point far beyond the walls of the
room.

                                LINDSEY
              ... and you lit another candle and put it beside
                mine and said "that's me"... and we stared at
                the two candles, and then we... well, if you
                remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the
                next part.  Bud, there are two candles in the
                dark.  I'm with you.  I'll always be with you.

A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall.  Bud falls on in
dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark.

They watch the screen, expectantly.

Nothing.  Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment.  Lindsey tried
unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice.

                Bud?  You hangin' in there?  Talk to me, Bud.
                Are you okay?

There is an agonizing pause, then the letters appear slowly:  SHAKING STOPED.

Bud is no longer in pain.  His expression is rapt.

LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape.  His last flare sputters out,
but there is light.  Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him.  And he's right... it is beautiful.

The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted
figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels.  Barren as
the moon but exquisite, serene.  Changeless.  A place unseen by human eyes.
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible.  Bud descends toward
the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf.  Below the shelf, the wall
slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.

ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit.  Bud's feet thump into the
sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles.  Touchdown... three and
half miles of water over his head.  Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of
fireflies.

AT GEEK prints out.  Monk takes the headset gently from Lindsey.

                                MONK
                Okay, Bud, we'll go step by step.  Take the
                cover plate off the firing box.

A long pause.  Then... PLATE OFF

                                MONK
                All right, Bud, you have to cut the ground wire,
                not the lead wire...

EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE                                                      218

Bud is peering into the detonator unit.  How bad is he?  We can't tell.

                                MONK (V.O.)
                It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not...
                I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow
                stripe.

Bud is staring.  Blinking.  The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're
miles away... way down there where his hands are.

The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK.  He pulls out the little
plastic tube.  Breaks and shakes.  It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green
light.  He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters.
CUTING NNOW he types to them.  He reaches into the detonator.

DETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical.  The
cutters go over on wire.  A long beat.  They withdraw, then go over the other
wire...

He cuts--

Everyone is frozen.  Waiting.  It's very quiet.

                                LINDSEY
                Would we see the flash?

                                MONK
                Through three miles of water?   I don't know.

They're holding their breaths.  Then... STILL HERE

A cheer goes up.  Rebel yells.

                                CATFISH
                Quiet, quiet!  Save you air, goddamnit.

                                MONK
                Bud, give me a reading off you liquid oxygen
                gauge.

TEN MINUTES WORTH ID SAY.  Lindsey does white.

                                HIPPY
                It took him over an hour to get down there--

It's hopeless.  Lindsey grabs the headset from Monk.

                                LINDSEY
                Drop you weights and start back now!  The gauge
                could be wrong...

EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE                                                      220

Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead.  His expression is enigmatic.
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon.  Starts to type.

INT. CONTROL MODULE                                                     221

The message comes in:  NO.  THINK ILL STAY A WHILE.  BEAUTIFUL HERE.  WORTH
ADMISSION

                                LINDSEY
                No!  You can make it!  You hear me?  Drop your
                weights... you... can breathe shallow... you...
                it could be wrong--

Lindsey's voice has twisted into a sob.  She begins to weep, quietly.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh God, Virgil, please...

DONT CRY BABY

A pause.  Then the words...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

Lindsey sobs at the mike.  The others look away.  The signal is weakening.
One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly.

LOVE YOU WIFE.

She stares at the printout.

                                LINDSEY
                Love you.

There is no reply.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. THE ABYSS                                                          222

A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his
horse in the desert.

Bud's eyelids close.  His chest barely moving.

A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly,
he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.

BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to
be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.

It is stunningly beautiful.

The creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.

Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the
abyss.

At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They
resolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey
nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.

Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the
center, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing
their home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city.

EXT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   223

Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark
surface of inhuman design.  The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth.

They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-
like opening.

INT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE                                                   224

Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him.  It is a
curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,
where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional
space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet
across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      225

Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a
few feet.

A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the
chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.
They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.

Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees.
Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.
He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what
he can only hope is air.  It is.

Bud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is
happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the
NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven
is gathered watching him.

                                BUD
                Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?

His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water
from the 'walls'.

In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be
circuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in
mid-air.  The image is about twenty feet across.

There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into...
the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news.  STATIC, then another
newscast.  And another.  Fragments of the same story.  The world on the brink
of war.

                                BUD
                You watch out TV?  That what you're trying to
                say?  That you know what's been going on up
                there?

The NTIs are impassive.  Static... then another newscast.

This time, we're allowed to focus on the story.  An on-the-scene interview
outside a high-tech seismology lab.  There is an air of hysteria about the
scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people
shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist.

                                REPORTER
              ... a Caltech scientist who is among those
                reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the
                world's oceans.  Dr. Breg, can you give us a
                clearer explanation then we're getting?

Berg is edgy and distracted.  People keeps handing him pieces of paper,
computer hardcopy.  The biggest thing in his life is happening...

                                BERG
                They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but
                with no seismological source.  The waves are
                propagating toward the shorelines of every
                continent--

An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning.  We see that Berg is
running scared.  The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational
mind.

                                BERG
                Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go.
                Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the
                slightest goddamn idea!

The image dissolves into static, fades out.  Bud turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                You're doing it!  Right?  That's what you're
                telling me.  Yeah, you can control water...
                that's your technology.  But why?

Static again, then a brilliant flash.  Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb
test in the Pacific.

The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an
unbroken white glare.  Bud gets the message.

                                BUD
                Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it.
                Where do you get off passing judgment on us,
                when you can't be sure?  How do you know?

The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments
from recent history...

US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in
Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and
bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at
Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old
contra with an AK-47...  Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each.
But enough.  The images continue.

HOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of
humanity.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA -- DAY                  226

A video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and
runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean.  Pandemonium reigns around
them, people running, driving, evacuating inland.

On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared.

It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the
horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    227

LONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the
Verazzano Narrows.  Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of
water impossibly high, still miles out.

EXT. NAVAL BASE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                 228

The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia,
where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave.

SIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base.
Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and
growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT, SANTA MONICA -- DAY                                   229

The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his
voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg
disaster.

                                REPORTER
                The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting
                to run... some are just staring, unable to
                move... the wave... the wave is... it's...
                I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high
                already... getting bigger as I'm watching...
                still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can
                hear it...

A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.  They
leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    230

The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is
blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall.

EXT. SAN FRANSISCO -- DAY                                               231

LONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the
buildings downtown.  Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which
defies our comprehension.  The image shakes with the THUNDER.

EXT. MALIBU -- DAY                                                      232

A diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which
transcends his worst nightmare.  He lies paralyzed on his board.

EXT. MIAMI -- DAY                                                       233

Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith.

In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him,
blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over,
about to break upon the teeming city.

And then...

The wave slows as it crests...

And stops.

IT SIMPLY STOPS.

2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun.  There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls.  Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover,
only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.  A news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.

EXT. MALIBU                                                             234

The surfer just blinks, starting.

EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY                                                    235

On the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a
shimmering blue wall which stands... waiting.

EXT. PETROPAVLOVSK NAVAL BASE, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT                        236

Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the
Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the
moonlight.  It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable
devastation... but it doesn't.

EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA                                     237

When all have seen...

The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface
of the sea is normal again.

VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea.  Moving from
face to face.  Various reactions as people respond to what they can only
understand as a miracle.  The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked...
laughing.  The cameraman is just walking.  Some people turn to him and smile,
or laugh, or whoop.

A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying.

A man is on his knees, shaking.

Total strangers hug each other.

A black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific
grin.

                                GUY
                Somebody just laid it down to us, man.  Things
                ain't never gonna be the same!

INT. FINAL CHAMBER                                                      238

Bud sits, shaken, watching the screen, as people react to their deliverance.
He turns to the NTIs.

                                BUD
                Why?  You could've done it.  Why didn't you?

The screen darkens.  Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if
someone was clumsily typing them.

WE KNEW THIS WAS...

And we've seen this before so we know the rest...

WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON.  BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.

A pause, then:

LOVE YOU WIFE

The last message expands to fill the entire screen.

Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the
aliens.  They bow their heads, just for a moment.  A sign of respect.

CLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            239

Lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring.  Withdrawn.

The others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark.

The air is looking pretty thick.  The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver
crackles to life.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                Deepcore, do you read?  This is Benthic Explorer,
                over.

                                CATFISH
                Hell yes, we read!  Good of you to join us.  How's
                that storm doin'?

                                MCBRIDE
                Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew
                itself out all of the sudden.  We're up here in
                a flat sea with no wind.  But then a lot of weird
                things've been happening.

                                CATFISH
                Well, hell, son.  You better get us a line down
                here, we're in moderately poor shape.

LATER, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring B.G. on how to get a new
umbilical hooked on.  One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone.

                                MCBRIDE
                They figure is was over a half mile high.

                                ONE NIGHT
                I wish I could have seen it--

She glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Hey.  Hey!  HEY!!  Look... it's Bud.

                                MONK
                That's impossible.

Lindsey bolts to the screen.  Stares at the message printing out.

A huge grin wraps around her face.

                                LINDSEY
                No it's not.

                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
                What's it say?

Lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen.  During the message, her
voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a
childlike joy.

INTERCUT BETWEEN DEEPCORE AND EXPLORER BRIDGE DURING THE FOLLOWING:

                                LINDSEY
                It says...
                "VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW

                THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE

Lindsey grins as she reads the next part...

                                LINSEY
                "THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT"

                                CATFISH
                I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack.

                                LINDSEY
                "THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY

Beyond the windows the ocean is calm.  The sky steel-gray put placid.  McBride
turns to Commodore DeMarco and the Navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked.

                                MCBRIDE
                Looks like you boys might by out of business.

                                BENDIX
                Something's going on down there.  I'm getting
                some big readings....

Bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a
Wurlitzer.

INT. DEEPCORE                                                           241

In Deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling.  The sonar
is going crazy.  One Night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to
her ear, then jerks it away.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Whew!  Whatever this is, it's major.

The rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water.

The glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the
viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance.

A last message appears on the screen:

KEEP YOU PANTYHOSE ON/YOURE GONNA LOVE THIS

The radiance intensifies.  Everyone covers their eyes.  It flares to
WHITE-OUT.

                                                                CUT TO:

INT./EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                        242

Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts.  All their instruments are pegged.

                                BENDIX
                Active is pinging back something big... it's
                enormous!  Coming up right under us.

                                DEMARCO
                Where?

                                BENDIX
                Where?  EVERYWHERE!!
                         (looks out the window)
                Over there!  Port bow.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN                                         243

A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not
swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.

It gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.

The ocean is OPENING.

Now the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.

McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.

The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.

The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.

SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly
curving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.

Off the port bow... another spire.

And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.

Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.

One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
CREATION.

And now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A
PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.

THE NTI ARK.

It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.

The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.

ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God.

                                BENDIX
                Look...

WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore
Two.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the
glistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.

CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.

Catfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind
him.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into
the light of the sun.  A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever
know.

                                LINDSEY
                We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.

                                CATFISH
                Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-
                up Coke.

                                HIPPY
                They must've done something to us.

Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for
their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for
the whole human race.

                                LINDSEY
                Oh, yes.  I think you could say that.

She blinks.  Seeing something not far away.  She gives a little laugh, or
something between laughing and crying.

REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.

She starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.

His smile, his eyes illuminating her.

He stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?

The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.

Then laugh.  She sniffs loudly.

                                LINDSEY
                Hello, Brigman.

                                BUD
                Hello, Mrs. Brigman.

Their lips meet.

                                                                CUT TO BLACK

          BLACK SCREEN

          The sounds of a large crowd, but muffled, as if we're inside,
          and hearing the crowd through a window or door. FADE IN ON:

          INT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY

          DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down,
          thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and
          confident. Content. Completely in his element.
          In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of
          individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the
          muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:

          VOICE ON PA SYSTEM
          Thank you so much for coming today--
          A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.

                         BLUE BLAZER
          Congressman Norris-?
          Now REVEAL that we're Â±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building
          at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad
          out front. "Norris for Senate" placards everywhere.

                         BLUE-BLAZER
          Fred O'Malley with the DNC. I've
          never seen a crowd this big turn
          out so early in the cycle.
          CHARLIE TRAYNOR, 36, arrives--.

                         CHARLIE
          Just wait 'till you see how they
          respond to him..
          David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens
          his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.

                         DAVID
          Don't build me up like that,
          Charlie. He'll be disappointed.

          EXT. ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY -- MAIN QUAD -- DAY

          The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with
          approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of
          the Admin Building.

                         DAVID
          Hi there. I'm David Norris. And
          I'm running for the US Senate.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 2.
          The crowd goes wild.

          MONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN
          --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
          The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
          ovation.
          --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison
          plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most
          politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
          --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
          with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
          --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
          redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
          --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
          David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
          today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
          follow him. Especially young people.
          --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
          as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
          camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
          mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
          --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
          tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
          into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie
          stands nearby watching him speak:.

          INT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK

          David enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly
          with the noisy energy of the campaign trail.
          He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a
          moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him.
          He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his
          itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and
          meetings across the state.
          He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the
          page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech
          he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open
          Space Initiative.

                         DAVID

          Ricky, Little League. John Pascal.
          Wife: Anna. St. John's grad. Two
          year old: Loyita...
          He stops. Knows this cold. His finger runs down to a
          Realtor's Association breakfast in Nassau County four days
          out.

                         DAVID

                         (MORE TESTING)
          Abagail "Abby" Best, Stuart
          Broxterman, Chapel Davis, Milan
          Sabovic, Jim Vargas...
          His ability to retain this sort of information is stunning.
          He doesn't need to review. It's already all there.
          He closes his itinerary file. Goes to the window and looks
          out at the trees.
          The silence back...it's deafening.

          INT. SHERATON LOBBY -- UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

          Charlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David,
          holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him
          as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's
          clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him
          aside.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell? What happened to
          "I'm going to have softie tea, rest
          my voice, and go to bed early?"
          You have Diane Sawyer tomorrow and
          you have to be up at four AM for us
          to make it in time.
          David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand
          he picks up a cup and saucer.

                         DAVID
          I had some tea.
          (sees Charlie's not in the

                         MOOD)
          Come on, man. We're eight points
          up in the polls. I've gotta cut
          loose every once in a while and
          have a life.
          This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen
          strangers in a crappy upstate Sheraton doesn't seem like
          having a life to him...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 4.

                         CHARLIE
          Ten.

                         DAVID
          What?

                         CHARLIE
          Latest poll has you ten points up.
          A slow smile spreads across David's face.

                         CUT TO:

                         BLACK SCREEN
          The sound of a busy room. Then one voice, much louder:

          CAMPAIGN AIDE.
           County reporting: 8901 for
          Lynfield, 7233 for Norris.

          INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT

          Charlie Traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that.
          She's writing vote totals onto a map of New York by county.

                         CHARLIE

                         (NATURAL OPTIMIST)
          Better than I thought, I thought
          we'd get killed in Seneca.
          He turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen
          Norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops.

                         CHARLIE
          Eddie, call Boyd! Where the hell
          are the. Suffolk numbers? We've got
          to get the Suffolk numbers!

          EXT. ROOFTOP NEAR WALDORF -- NIGHT

          A light snow falls. Four MEN IN CONSERVATIVE SUITS,
          overcoats, and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty-story
          building. Their clothing is more timeless than old-
          fashioned. And somehow so is their demeanor.
          The men get to the edge and look down over the city, almost-
          as if it's their domain.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 5.

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

          David watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are
          discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already
          called for David's opponent.

                         PUNDIT #1
          Congressman Norris has a reputation
          for being very direct, even blunt,
          in his campaign speeches, which is
          great until you say too many things
          you wish you hadn't. Then you
          start to look like an amateur.

                         PUNDIT #2
          That's bad for any candidate but
          it's fatal if you're running for
          Senate at the age of 33, your
          opponent keeps calling you an
          "impulsive kid," and you almost
          killed your entire political career
          five months ago with an act of
          immaturity that ended up on the
          front page of`.the New York Post.
          David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then
          Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through
          the open door behind him.

                         -CHARLIE
          Why are you still watching CNN?
          They called this way too early.
          David doesn't share his friend's optimism.

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE'-- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT

          A' campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room:

                         AIDE
          Suffolk County Numbers!
          Charlie and David emerge from the private room to listen.

           AIDE (O.S.)
          Lynfield: 415,120. Norris:

          370,233.
          Charlie's energy and optimism disappear instantly.

                         CHARLIE
          (after long beat)
          I really thought we'd win Suffolk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 6.
          A senior aide walks over.

                         SENIOR AIDE
          Kings County just came in too.

                         A BRUTAL
          He shows a piece of paper to Charlie and David.
          beat...

                         DAVID
          Well, it's over. And it's going to
          be a blowout...
          David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment
          that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going
          to lose big. It's going to be a grand,. public humiliation.

                         SENIOR AIDE
          NBC has us up next.
          Charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest TV to NBC.

                         BRIAN WILLIAMS
          Turning now to the New York Senate
          race, NBC is now calling the
          election for Roger'Lynfield. After
          a shockingly poor showing in both
          Suffolk county and in his home
          county, Kings, it now appears that
          David Norris will lose this
          election badly, perhaps by as much
          as 10 points.

          EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          The four men in dark suits.. The boss's name is RICHARDSON,
          early 40s. His top aide is.AHARRY, 50s.

                         RICHARDSON
          This is a.bignight, gentleman.

                         (TOHARRY)
          Is ever ything set?
          Harry nods. Richardson notices his eyes:

                         RICHARDSON
          You look tired. You should take a
          vacation when we finish with this.
          You'll have earned it.

                         HARRY
          I'm not sure the kind of tired I
          feel would be fixed by a vacation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 7.

                         RICHARDSON
          Sure it would. Everybody needs a
          vacation. Even us.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. WALDORF HOTEL SUITE -- NERVE CENTER -- NIGHT

          The staff and supporters in here have become very quiet.
          Their candidate is standing in the middle of the room, but no
          one can look at him. And David can't look at them either...

                         DAVID

                         (TO CHARLIE)
          I'm going to take a walk, figure
          out my speech.

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          Four-hundred campaign workers follow election news on big
          screens in the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom. No one says a word.
          The mood has gone from.hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds.

          INT. WALDORF LOBBY -- NIGHT

          David slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the
          staff. But when he.gets to the door he sees that press vans
          line the front of the hotel. There will be no peace for him
          if he steps out there. He turns around.

                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
          Good evening, Congressman. You're
          in the Grand Ballroom if that's
          what you're looking for.

                         DAVID
          Actually just looking for a place
          to be alone for a minute before I
          head in there.

                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
          None of the banquet rooms on the
          third floor are in use tonight.

                         DAVID
          Thank you.

          INT. EMPTY BANQUET ROOM -- NIGHT

          David stands alone looking out at the empty room. Trying to
          get used to it. It's not easy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 8.

          INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           David enters the huge, ornate, men's room and goes to the row
          of sinks. He pulls two Ricola cherry lozenges from his
          pocket. He twirls them in his hands for a moment.
          Then tosses them into the trash can. He looks at himself in
          the mirror, fighting to hold himself together.
          A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one
          of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an
          expensive bottle of champagne.

                         WOMAN
          Hi. I hope I didn't startle you.

                         DAVID
          What are you doing in here?

                         WOMAN
          Hiding from security.

                         DAVID
          Oh... . What did you do?

                         WOMAN
          Crashed a wedding. One floor up.

                         DAVID
          It's almost midnight. They'just
          caught on now?

                         WOMAN
          Ivana Trump finally realized I
          wasn't her niece. I think after
          the fifth; glass of champagne my
          Czech accent started slipping.
          spite of David's state that gets a grin.

                         DAVID
          Are you for real?

                         WOMAN
          Life is short.

                         DAVID
          Hard to argue with that.

                         WOMAN
          You're that guy running for Senate
          aren't you?

                         DAVID
          I'm "that guy."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 9.

                         WOMAN
          You winning?

                         DAVID
          No.

                         WOMAN
          Too bad. The other guy's a tool.

                         DAVID

                         (LAUGHS)
          Maybe I should have made that
          clearer in my ads.

                         WOMAN
          Personally, I think mooning your
          friends at a college reunion is no
          big deal.

                         (BEAT)
          And I don't think the Post should
          have printed the photo.
          David just shakes his head. He will never, ever live that
          down and he knows it.

                         WOMAN
          At least not full page.
          He can't help but crack up.

                         WOMAN
          Listen, I've done it.

                         DAVID
          You weren't running, for Senate at
          the time.

                         WOMAN
          Do you still have a chance or is it
          over?

                         DAVID
          He crushed me.
          She has beautiful eyes. And an exceptional gift for
          conveying empathy...

                         WOMAN
          You must ...I don't know what you
          must be feeling...

                         DAVID
          Winning would feel better. But
          losing has its advantages.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 10.

                         WOMAN
          Like what?

                         DAVID
          The only time a politician is alone
          is when he's asleep.. .or in the
          bathroom. After eight years in
          politics that gets kind of hard to
          take.
          She tilts her head a little, gives him a curious look.

                         WOMAN
          Watching you, you'd never know it.
          The way she looks at him, the way she says it, David knows
          she sees what others miss in him -- even if he isn't even
          quite sure what it is. Not yet.

                         DAVID
          Thank you...

                         WOMAN
          Well, everything happens for a
          reason, right? Even losing. God,
          I'm really rollrng out the
          platitudes tonight, aren't I?

                         DAVID
          It's the champagne. Brines out the
          Hallmark in people.

                         WOMAN
          After it kills their Czech accents.
          She offers:him the bottle. He hesitates, then takes it.

                         DAVID
          Why not? I have to think up some
          good platitudes for my speech.
          He takes a gulp of champagne.

                         WOMAN
          Why the hell would you do that?

                         DAVID
          Apparently, even if I hadn't been
          caught dropping my drawers in the
          middle of a senate campaign I would
          have lost the election anyway
          because I'm too blunt.

                         WOMAN
          (swig of champagne)
          Says who?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 11.

                         DAVID
          The TV pundits.

                         WOMAN
          Fuck 'em. They just wish they had
          the balls to be candidates
          themselves.
          She hands him the champagne bottle again.

                         WOMAN
          And they work for the Man anyway.

                         (BEAT)
          You going to run again?

                         DAVID

                         (DRINKS)
          Tonight's probably not the night to
          ask.

                         WOMAN

                         (FINGER POINTING)
          No, it is. Look at me. You have
          to run again. Do-yo hear me?
          She's serious about this. Intense.

                         WOMAN
          Otherwise the-country will be run
          by tools. like Lynwood.

                         DAVID
          "Field."
          (of f her look)
          "Lynfield."
          A beat. She shrugs.
          Then they lean toward each other... and kiss. It turns more
          and more passionate. When they finally pull apart:

                         DAVID
          Holy shit.
          She seems just as surprised. They look at each other and
          laugh.
          Just then the bathroom door opens. It's Charlie. He sees
          David and the woman.

                         CHARLIE
          David?

                         WOMAN

                         (SUDDENLY EMBARRASSED)
          I better go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 12.
          She exits.

                         DAVID

                         WAIT--

          INT. 3RD FLOOR BALLROOM AREA

          The woman comes out of the bathroom. David is right behind
          her. Then Charlie.

                         DAVID
          Wait.
          The woman turns to face David. Suddenly two hotel guards
          turn the corner and spot the woman.

                         HOTEL SECURITY
          There!
          They rush toward her.

                         WOMAN
          Gotta go.
          (to David, emphatically.)
          Don't let the bastards grind you
          down.
          She spins and sprints away. The hotel guards chase her.

                         CHARLIE
          What the hell was that?

                         DAVID
          I'm really not sure.
          David has a huge grin on his face.

                         DAVID
          But I think I'm ready to give my
          speech.

          INT. GRAND BALLROOM -- NIGHT

          David as he walks out from behind a curtain onto the dais.
          His supporters start clapping... . but clearly they're
          heartbroken. David looks completely peaceful.

                         DAVID
          I grew up in Red Hook and I don't
          want to shock anybody but I got in
          a few fist fights along the way.
          Laughter ripples through the crowd. We don't know enough yet
          to get the joke.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 13.

                         DAVID
          And we used to have a saying when
          you got in a fight: "it's not
          whether or not you get knocked down
          -- because eventually everyone does
          -- it's what you do when you get
          back up."

                         (BEAT)
          Don't worry, I'm not going to moon
          you.
          The audience explodes with laughter this time.

                         DAVID
          But I am...
          (waiting for the laughter
          to die down)
          But I am going to get backup. I
          wanted to come out here tonight and
          give you a victory speech, a speech
          I've dreamed of giving foremost of
          my life. But life doesn't always
          deal you the cards you want.
          The audience sobered now. Reflective.

                         DAVID
          My life changed when I was ten
          years old. My entire world turned
          upside-down.'
          His audience,. knows exactly what he's talking about.

                         DAVID
          And as I looked for something to
          -hang ;on to, something; to help me
          cope' with what had. happened the
          only thing that made sense to me
          was service. Finding a way to do
          something with my life that left
          this world a little better than I
          found it.
          The audience is moved. Tears begin to well up. People dab
          at their eyes.

          EXT. MADISON SQ. PARK -- PRE DAWN

          The sky is just beginning to turn from black to deep blue.
          The park is still and silent.
          A black Mercedes pulls up on Madison Ave. Mr. Richardson,
          again in a dark suit, gets out and enters the park.

          Harry sits on one of the benches -- a fedora in his lap to
          complement a gray flannel suit. Richardson arrives.

                         RICHARDSON
          He spills his coffee when he steps
          out of Starbucks. The moment he
          comes through the door.

                         HARRY
          Got it.

                         RICHARDSON
          Our models indicate between 7:00
          and 7:05 am.
          Harry nods but he seems distant Richardson sees this.

                         RICHARD SON
          You planned that vacation, right?

                         HARRY
          Two weeks.
          Richardson claps him din-the shoulder and leaves. Harry
          watches him go.

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          An alarm clock reads "5:44 airy." It turns to "5:45" and the
          alarm goes off. A hand reaches over and taps the alarm off.
          FOLLOW the arm back to David Norris in a king-sized bed. He
          rubs his eyes, stretches his neck, and climbs out of bed.

          INT. EQUINOX GYM. -- MORNING

          David works out. He's got the-energy-level of a 25 year-old.

          Through the window we see David getting his morning coffee.
          He exits and LEAVES FRAME. HOLD on the door of Starbucks.

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          Harry is snoring on his bench. David walks past.

          EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- DAY

          David arrives at Fifth just in time to catch the "M1 Limited-
          Stop" bus arriving`at the stop.

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          Sunlightpeeks:.through a gap in the buildings and falls on
          Harry's left eye, waking him. He bolts upright. Checks his
          watch, Shit! He looks around quickly. Spots David about to

                         INT MORNING

          The bus pulls out. Harry keeps running after it.

                         HARRY
          No...

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          As David walks down the aisle a couple of passengers
          recognize his face. . .but they don't say anything.
          David nears an empty aisle seat. A woman is curled up in the
          window seat, sleeping. She wears a funky mini-dress, knee-
          high argyle socks under leather boots, and a (clashing)
          argyle bucket cap.
          David sits next to her. And stares.

                         DAVID
          No way...
          It's the woman from election night.', He leans around to try
          to see the front of her face. "It's definitely her. His
          eyes drift down at her legs. Just then she opens her eyes.
          She recoils for a second;. Then` her eyes soften when she
          realizes who it is.

                         DAVID

                         (MOMENTARLY SELF-

                         CONSCIOUS)
          I think. we "ve met.

                         WOMAN

                         (DEADPAN)
          You need a better line than that or
          I'll have to assume you're a
          pervert who likes to stare at
          girls' legs while-, they sleep.

                         DAVID
          (smiles, game on)
          Your skirt was so short I couldn't
          help it.

                         WOMAN
          Dress.

                         DAVID
          Skirt, dress, same thing.

                         WOMAN
          If you're a pervert, yeah. All
          that matters is they both show leg.

                         DAVID
          So do shorts, dear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 18.

                         WOMAN
          Yeah, but there's that pesky piece
          of fabric right here that
          interferes with your fantasy life.
          She shuts her eyes and leans against the window.

                         WOMAN
          Wake me when you have a good come
          back to that.

                         DAVID
          I have one but, unlike you, I
          wouldn't say it in public.

                         WOMAN
          (eyes still closed)
          Pussy.
          David laughs. Can not believe this woman. In a good way.
          His blackberry RINGS. Her eyes pop open. David.picks up.

                         DAVID
          Hello...? Hello?
          David looks at his. phone. The signal has gone to zero.

                         DAVID

                         (TO WOMAN)
          The line cut.

                         WOMAN
          That ringer get any-louder or do
          you pretty much have it maxed out?

                         DAVID
          You're relentless.

                         WOMAN
          I never sleep through the night. I
          catch up on the bus.

                         (BEAT)
          You going to run again?

                         DAVID
          I just started a new job, today.

                         WOMAN

                         (SERIOUS NOW)
          I saw your concession speech. I
          heard Bill Clinton called it the
          best political speech he's seen in
          20 years.
          David looks back at her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 19.

                         DAVID
          Something got into me.
          He means her. They stare at each other.

                         DAVID
          What's the deal with you and
          argyles?

                         WOMAN
          What's the deal with you and boring
          shades of blue?
          David is wearing a Navy blue suit, blue shirt, and blue tie.
          A beat.

                         DAVID
          At least my clothes match.

                         WOMAN
          That's easy if you. restrict
          yourself to one color.

                         DAVID
          The belt and shoes are black.

                         WOMAN
          Variety is the spice of .life .

                         DAVID
          There you` go with the platitudes
          again. I guess it wasn't the
          ch mpagne .
          His blackberry goes again. RING-RING.

                         DAVID
          Hello? Hello?
          He shakes his head. It's dead again.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH STREET -- MORNING

           Harry runs down Broadway looking east on 19th to try to spot
          the bus on Park.

          INT. BUS --MORNING


                          WOMAN
          Your phone sucks. Don't guys like
          you get special phones that
          actually work in the middle of the
          biggest city in the country?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 20.

                         DAVID
          Depends what the telecom lobby
          thinks of your voting record.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH STREET -- MORNING

          Harry spots the bus passing on Park. He jams his fedora on
          his head and stretches his arm out--

                         HARRY
          Now.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David's phone rings again. As he reaches for the phone he
          fumbles his coffee cup, the lid comes off, and a slosh of
          coffee crests the brim and splashes on the woman's dress.

                         DAVID
          Oh, Jesus...

                         (FIGHTING LAUGHTER)
          I'm sorry.

          EXT. BROADWAY AND 19TH -- MORNING

          Harry's face.

                         HARRY
          Shit!
          He's looking at a leather portfolio. We catch a glimpse
          inside: a complicated circuit diagram. Harry shuts the
          book, look's up to get a bead on" the the bus, then takes off down
          Broadway, again, hoping to cut it off at Union Square.

          INT.'BUS -- MORNING


                         DAVID
          I'll pay for the damage.
          He pulls out his wallet. There's $7 inside. She laughs.

                         WOMAN
          Hope your new job pays better than
          your old one.

                         DAVID
          Give me your number and I'll send
          you a check.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 21.

                         WOMAN
          God, that is smooth. Spill coffee
          on me then ask for my number.
          She takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip,
          then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes.

                         WOMAN
          Just let me spill some on you and
          we'll be even.
          She thrusts the cup toward his tie. David parries.

                         DAVID
          It's my first day at the office!

                         WOMAN
          Tell your boss some crazy chick
          dumped coffee on you on the MI.
          It's New York; he'll understand.
          She thrusts the cup back at him-

                         DAVID
          No!
          He grabs the cup with both his hands over hers.

                         WOMAN

                         (ACTUALLY PLEADING)
          Come on. Just a little.
          They struggle with the cup. <,;:Both suppressing laughter.

                         DAVID
          You're crazy. Actually crazy.
          The phone on David's lap'RINGS again. She snatches it with
          her free hand.

                         WOMAN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          He's not here!
          She hangs up.

                         DAVID
          Who was that?
          She shrugs. Sorry, pal. He lunges for his phone, but she
          holds it on the other side of her body.

                         DAVID
          What is this, third grade?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 22.

                         WOMAN
          You forgot what that was like,
          didn't you? How fun it was...
          That stops him for a moment. Until the phone RINGS again.

                         WOMAN
          Oh my God! How do you stand it?
          She drops the phone into the coffee.

                         WOMAN
          There. We're even.
          He stares at her. Incredulous. They lock eyes. God knows
          what would come next if they were in private...
          The fourth RING gurgles up through the coffee. A beat.

                         WOMAN
          Sturdy little fucker, isn't it?
          She pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her
          scarf, pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail.
          Then she reaches out her hand, as if to shake.

                         WOMAN
          By the way, I'm Elise.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- DAY

          Elise exits.. the bus. David stands at the bus door watching
          her. She turns back to look at him.

                         DAVID
          The morning after .I lost I woke up
          thinking about you .
          That melts her. Instantly. All her bravado drops.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          Moments later. Through the window, David watches Elise
           walking down the sidewalk. Their eyes meet. She blows him
           a little kiss before she turns the corner. His heart skips
          a beat as the bus continues on down Union Square East.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING

          Harry runs through Union Square bee-lining for David's bus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 23.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David looks at Elise's number, scribbled on a piece of paper.
          He carefully tucks her number into his wallet. Then takes
          the most satisfying sip of coffee he's ever had in his life--

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING

          Spotting David through the bus window, Harry thrusts his
          Fedora back onto his head and points at the bus--

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          Just as David finishes his sip the-plastic lid pops off the
          cup. A second earlier and the coffee would have poured all
          over his shirt. Instead it spills: on the floor.

          EXT. UNION SQUARE -- MORNING


                         HARRY
          Dammit!
          Harry sprints out onto lark Avenue now, right behind the bus--
          HONK! Harry turns just in time to see a.taxi skid into him.
          TRUNK! He rolls up onto the hood--

          INT. RSR CAPITAL -- CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          A big corner office. The phone rings. Charlie picks up.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING

          A dazed Harry lies in the road... The taxi driver who hit
          him jumps out of his car to see if Harry is okay...

                         DAVID
          She kissed me. I just didn't
          fight it.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH -- MORNING

          Harry sits up... He's bruised but okay. He looks around for
          something. Spots his crushed hat under the taxi's front
          tire.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING


           CHARLIE (O.S.)
          You're shitting me. Just randomly
          you sit down next to--
          He's cut off mid-word.

                         DAVID
          Charlie?
          David looks at his phone. "Call Lost" on the screen. David
          hits redial. Gets a fast busy.

                         DAVID
          ' (to himself).
          This is ridiculous.
          He pockets his phone.

          EXT. PARK AVENUE SOUTH MORNING

          The taxi driver is with Harry now.

                         TAXI DRIVER
          Are you okay?
          Harry is sitting now, wincing, but still searching intently
          for something.

                         HARRY
          I'm fine-- Will you hand me that?
           Harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few
          feet away. We'll come to know it as a "PLANBOOK."

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 25.

          TAXI DRIVER (CONT'D)
          Are you sure you're okay?
          The driver hands it to him. Harry flips to a bookmarked
          page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
          Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
          symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
          language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
          And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
          lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.

                         HARRY
          Oh...shit...

          EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING

          David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office
          tower. He enters through the revolving door--

          INT. DAVID'S OFFICE BUILDING'-- GROUND FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING

          Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other
          end of the lobby. David gets into an empty elevator.

          INT. 41ST FLOOR LOBBY -- MORNING

          David walks past the receptionist She's on the phone. He
          waves as-he:passes by. No wade back. She must not see him.

                         DAVID
          Okay...
          Daviddecides he doesn't need to announce himself.

          INT. RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- MORNING

           David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul
          in sight. Not a single secretary is here.

                         DAVID
          (loud, playful)
          Doesn't anybody bother getting in
          before eight at this place?
          David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a
          large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office
          marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 26.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)

                         (EXUBERANT)
          Susan! How are you today?
          (when she doesn't move)
          Susan?
          David looks closer across her desk. Her face is frozen.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          Susan?
          He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead
          still. David rushes through Charlie's door:

                         DAVID
          Call 911! Something's wrong with
          Susan!

          INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE -- MORNING

          --and rushes in to find that Charlie is frozen too -- with
          the phone up to his ear. Like he's in a wax museum.
          He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver
          protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).
          One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached
          to the left side.of Charlie's skull.

                         DAVID
          Jesus!
          Three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see
          David. it's Mr. Richardson and-two aides we recognize as the
          "security guards" who chased Elise away on election night.

          DAVID (,.CONT'D)
          What the hell are you doing?!
          Richardson blinks Clearly surprised. Then:

                         RICHARDSON
          Grab him!
          David bolts out of the office as they lunge at him--

          INT. RSR OFFICE FLOOR -- MORNING

          David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he
          gets there. He grabs it. It's locked.
          He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges
          from a door in the middle of the hallway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 27.
          David jumps a mile. It's physically impossible that
          Richardson could have gotten there that fast.

                         RICHARDSON
          You can't get away, David.
          David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down
          an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last
          five steps and hits the floor hard.
          As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is
          frozen solid.
          David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find
          Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall.
          Again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast--
          David spins and-- A DISTORTED WIDE ANGLE SHOT of a
          chloroform rag shoved right at us. FOCUS GOES IN AND OUT...
          FROM DAVID'S POV, BLURRY FOCUS as he's carried toward one of
          the large corner offices on the 40th floor.
          The nameplate reads "Steve Kincaid."
          Richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying David,

                         INSIDE --
           Except when they walk through the door they're not in an
          office 40 floors above lower Manhattan,: they step inside a
          large warehouse...
          Their movement completely violates the laws of physics.

                         BLACK SCREEN
          Silence. Then voices come up slowly:

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Yes, sir. No, sir. No, sir. I
          understand that, sir. Absolutely.
          I'll do that, sir.

                         (BEAT)
          What a goddamm mess.

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          Was that Donaldson?

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Yes.

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          What do you want to do?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 28.
           FADE UP -- BLURRY AT FIRST -- to DAVID'S POV of the warehouse
          David caught a glimpse of just before he passed out.
          A half-dozen members of the "Intervention Team" (the Silver
          Suits) stand nearby. Richardson and MCCRADY (one of the men
          from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away.

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)
          Can you reset him?

          MCCRADY (O.S.)
          I don't think we have the authority
          in a situation like this.

          RICHARDSON (O.S.)

                         CALL LEGAL-

          BURDENSKY (0.S.).
          Legal just arrived.

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          REVEAL BURDENSKY, a 50 year-old in a pin-stripe suit,
          carrying a briefcase. He.walks to Richardson.

                         BURDENSKY
          Re-setting's off the table. This
          is our fault:...
          Richardson glances irately at Harry, who stands by himself
          off to the side, clearly disgraced.
          David, who is tied to a chair facing away from Richardson,
          cranes around to see who's talking.

                         DAVID
          Hey.
          The suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to
          talking amongst themselves -- though at a lower volume.

                         RICHARDSON
          What are my options?

                         BURDENSKY

                         (IGNORING DAVID)
          You could bullshit him but you'll
          never be completely successful.

                         DAVID
          Can somebody tell me what's going
          on?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 29.

                         BURDENSKY
          (still ignoring him)
          The questions will burn in him till
          the day he dies. You'll have to
          monitor him constantly...

                         ON DAVID
          He can hear little snippets of what Burdensky's saying--

          BURDENSKY (PARTIALLY AUDIBLE)
          .to make sure he doesn't talk...
          the endless ripple effects...
          REVEAL David untying the rope restraining him.

          ON THE SUITS

                         BURDENSKY
          If it were me, I'd level with him.

                         RIC:HARDSON
          Completely?

                         BURDENSKY
          That's the only way to extinguish
          his curiosity.
          Richardson turns and studies David. Then walks over to him.
          An uncomfortable pause.

                         DAVID
          Who are you guys?

                         RICHARDSON
          We're the people v ho make sure
          things happen according to Plan.
          David stares back at him for a moment.
          then leaps up. His rope comes off and the chair falls. He
          sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse.
          Richardson makes a little gesture with his hand--

          CLOSE-UP OF THE FLOOR
          It cracks.. .and displaces upward.. .so it's uneven just as
          David's foot comes down on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 30.

          BACK TO WIDE SHOT
          David trips and goes flying--

                         MOMENTS LATER
          David is dragged back to the center of the room and placed
          back in his chair in front of Richardson.

                         RICHARDSON
          Did you really think I couldn't see
          that coming?
          David dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          I can read your mind!
          David stares back.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          Yeah, really...

                         (BEAT)
          Choose a color.
          (barely a beat)
          Blue. Choose a number.
          (even less time)
          Seventeen.
          David's jaw drops slightly. Richardson was clearly right.

                         RICHARDSON
          Now,. why are you still deciding
          whether or not to run?
          David's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic
          response, as if;s.omehow that will keep his thoughts from
          spilling out into view.

                         RICHARDSON
          You saw the futility of that back
          at the office.
          David's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking
          point. He can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all
          this based in the world he's known to date...

                         DAVID
          What the hell is happening to me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 31.

                         RICHARDSON
          You just saw behind a curtain you
          weren't even supposed to know was
          there, Mr. Norris. Its jarring.
          I'm sure.

                         DAVID
          I just... came to work...

                         RICHARDSON
          It wasn't your fault. Your Path
          through the world this morning was
          supposed to be adjusted.
          (glancing bitterly at
          Harry, in the corner)
          Your coffee was supposed to.spill
          onto your shirt as you left
          Starbucks near your apartment.
          You would have gone up to change
          and arrived at work ten minutes
          later than you did. By then we
          would have left.

                         (BEAT)
          People call it "chance" when their
          coffee spills or their internet
          goes down or they misplace their
          keys. Sometimes it is. Sometimes
          it's:us...nudging you back on Plan.
          David takes all this in. He's still shell-shocked.

                         DAVID
          Whatever you were doing to Charlie
          back there... it wasn't misplacing
          his keys.

                         RICHARDSON
          Sometimes. when nudging a person
          back on Plan isn't enough we
          intervene directly.

                         DAVID
          Why Charlie? What did you do to
          him.

                         RICHARDSON
          You need to worry about getting
          back on your Plan, David, not worry
          about us putting him back on his.
          David stares back, still trying to get his bearings.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          Only a handful of human beings know
          what you now know, David. We're
          determined to keep it that way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 32.

                         RICHARDSON (CONT'D)
          So before I let you go, you need to
          understand something: If you ever
          reveal our existence we will erase
          your brain. Your memories, your
          emotions, your entire personality
          will be expunged. Your friends and
          family will think you've gone
          crazy. You won't "think" anything
          because a blank slate can't
          "think."
          Davidstares back.

                         RICHARDSON
          Do you understand what I just said?

                         DAVID
          Yes...

                         RICHARDSON
          Not a word. Not one word about us.
          (long beat as he studies

                         DAVID'S FACE)
          okay ... . you're free to go.
          David stands there a monent..:.not sure it's real. Richardson
          points at the door. David walks toward it.
          Just then another man comes up to Richardson.

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          There's awoman.

                         RICHARDSON

                         (SIGHS)
          There's always & Woman...
          Richardson motions;to his men.
          At.-THE DOOR
          Two men come through from outside and block David's exit.

                         DAVID
          He said I could go.

          CENTER OF ROOM

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          You won't believe who she is.
          He holds open a Planbook for Richardson to see.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 33.

                         RICHARDSON
          How is that possible? Why didn't
          we get an alert?

          NEW MAN IN SUIT
          He wasn't supposed to be on that
          bus. He was supposed to be
          changing his shirt in his
          apartment... It was a controlled
          situation. It was supposed to be.
          The new man looks at Harry.

          AT THE DOOR
          David looks back at Richardson.

                         DAVID
          You said I could go.
          Richardson walks over to him.

          RIC,HARDSON
          You ran into a woman named Elise on
          the bus this morning?

                         DAVID
          (:going very still)
          Why does it'matter?

                         RICHARDSON
          You weren't ever supposed to see
          her again.

                         DAVID
          Why do you care.?

                         RICHARDSON
          Because, David, you can't be with
          her. And we didn't want to have to
          resort to this--
          Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
          prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches
          into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--

                         DAVID
          What the hell-- What are you--
          Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her
          number on from David's wallet--

                         DAVID (CONT'D)

                         NO--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 34.
          Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then
          pulls out a lighter--

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          No!
          And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull
          loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team
          men. But he can't get free.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          What is wrong with you people?!
          Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn.
          ON David's reaction CUT TO:

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY

          David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
          He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
          walking to the corner to orient himself.
          Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
          the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.

          INT. BROOKLYN COCKTAIL LOUNGE -- AFTERNOON

          David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly.

                         BARTENDER
          You're David Norris, right?

                         DAVID
          Ice water.

                         BARTENDER
          That's it?
          David nods. Harry arrives.

                         HARRY
          We should talk. But not here. Go
          back to work and I'll contact you
          later today with a place to meet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 35.

                         DAVID
          Okay.
          Harry can see that David is still very shaken.

                         HARRY
          The world's exactly the same as
          it's always been. You just
          understand it more completely now.

                         (BEAT)
          Hang on to what mattered before you
          knew any of this and you'll be
          fine.

          EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- DAY

          A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward
          downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.

          INT. RSR OFFICES -- DAY

          David enters. Stares at,,hisnew colleagues going about their
          business as if nothing happened.

          INT. 40TH FLOOR --:DAY

          David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve
          Kincaid." He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty
          office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely
          disorienting for him.

          SECRETARY(O.S.)
          Mr. IKincaid's in the finance
          meeting, Congressitan. Main
          conference room.
          David turns to see her.

                         DAVID
          Thanks.
          David walks away, still trying to get his bearings in the new
          reality he now knows. Charlie comes around a corner.

                         CHARLIE
          There you are. I called your cell
          ten times. You left me hanging.

                         DAVID
          Sorry...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 36.

                         CHARLIE
          (seeing the look in

                         DAVID'S EYES)
          Are you okay?
          (off David's nod)
          Come on, we're late. Happy first
          day by the way.
          They head towards the conference room.

                         CHARLIE
          You sure you're okay.

                         DAVID
          Fine. How about you?

                         CHARLIE
          Great. Why?

                         DAVID
          No headaches or--

                         CHARLIE
          I feel fantastic, -man. Is it just,
          me or is this an odd conversation?
          (off David" s non-response.)
          What the hell happened with the
          girl?

                         DAVID
          After the meeting.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM RSR CAPITAL DAY

          LONG SHOT from outside the building. The firm's partners sit
          at their weekly investment committee meeting. David watches
          Charlie intently, looking for what's changed...

          INT RSR CAPITAL OFFICES -- DAY
          David and Charlie walk back to David's office.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Please explain to me why you don't
          have an ear-to-ear smile right now.

                         THEY ENTER--

          INT. DAVID'S OFFICE -- DAY

          David hesitates. It's like his friend is an alien.. .but then
          again he's totally normal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 37.

                         DAVID
          I lost her number.

                         CHARLIE
          You lost her number?

                         DAVID
          (searching for something)
          I was pickpocketed.

                         CHARLIE
          Come on. You can't be serious.
          (off David's look)
          You're serious... Oh, man...dude.
          I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...

           EXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY

           David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks
           up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them
           warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a
          ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.
          EXT. CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY
          The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so
          there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands
          looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.

                         HARRY
          A lot of people just collapse when
          they see what you've s'een. Their
          personal choices suddenly seem
          meaningless to them. Life starts
          to feel pointless.

                         DAVID
          I was` raised to believe there's
          something behind the curtain. I
          just never pictured it quite like
          this.

                         HARRY
          Most people don't.
          Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his
          colleagues. He's far from relaxed.

                         HARRY
          How are you feeling?

                         DAVID
          You should know. You can read my
          mind, right?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 38.
          Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David,
          how far to go with this. Finally:

                         HARRY
          Richardson was just trying to scare
          you.

                         DAVID
          He knew what color I was thinking.

                         HARRY
          Because he set it up as a choice.
          "Choose a color. Choose a number"

                         DAVID
          So?
          Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
          himself out there:

                         HARRY
          We can't read your mind or hear
          your thoughts. But before you make
          a choice your brain weighs options,
          and we percpite that. We know if
          you're going to go off Plan "or not
          because, as long as we're close
          enough, we cansense it when it's
          about to happen.

                         DAVID
          it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?

                         HARRY
          Seventh, actually.

                         DAVID
          What did they do too Charlie?

                         HARRY
          Made some small change in the way
          he assesses risk.

                         DAVID
          What type of risk?

                         HARRY
          (this is beside the point)
          I don't know. Something arcane.
          Something to do with mortgage-
          backed securities.

                         DAVID
          That's all?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2/12/09 39

                         HARRY
          Yes.

                         DAVID
          What would your colleagues do to
          you if they knew what you were
          telling me?
          This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.

                         HARRY
          That's why we're meeting out here.

                         DAVID
          They're not following me?

                         HARRY
          We don't have the manpower to
          follow everybody all the time.
          They're checking in on you. Just
          not here. Not right now.
          ON David's face considering this.

          EXT. UPPER DECK DAY

          Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few
          tourists up here.

                         DAVID
          Why are you helping me?

                         HARRY
          I have my reasons.
          David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into

                         THEM:

                         DAVID
          Why do they care if I'm with Elise?

                         HARRY
          Your entire reality gets shattered
          this morning and you want to know
          about a woman?

                         DAVID
          Why do they care?
          Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
          seems to care.

                         HARRY
          I don't know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 40.

                         DAVID
          You have no idea?

                         HARRY
          All I know is, given the amount of
          resources they've used, keeping you
          from her is pretty important to
          them.
          (off David's silence)
          You're going to look for her aren't
          you?
          Again, David is silent.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
          There are twelve million people in
          this city. On a slow day. You're
          not going to find her, you do
          realize that, don't yore-?

                         (BEAT)
          Even if a hypnotist pulled her
          number out of the recesses of your
          brain, no matter how many times you
          called it, you,'d never get
          through...

                         DAVID
          (his face hardening)
          They send you here to tell me that?

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
          You want my advice? Forget about
          her. Accept that you'`>ll never see
          her again. Move on with your life.
          ON David as Harry's words sink in.

                         FADE TO:

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside
          David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's
           already awake, staring at the ceiling...
           After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it
          off. But then just lies there...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 41.

           INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

           It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead
           of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six
          windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to
           his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed.
           No files on the table, like there were the last time we were
          here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.

           CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          How are you feeling about the
          speech?
          David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
          subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:

                         DAVID
          I'm ready... I changed a few
          things last night.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          Tell me at breakfast.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID
          David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is
          a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a
          moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
          park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years
          ado.` Even his posture and,-gait are different.

          INT. BUS -- MORNING

          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the
          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more
          out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.

          INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING

          David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with
          a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the
          window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
          DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 42.
          David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
          now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same
          eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps
          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.

                         DAVID
          Stop the bus.

                         DRIVER
          The next stop--

                         DAVID
          Now.

          EXT. EAST VILLAGE -- MORNING

          The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as
          he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. He
          catches up to her at University Place.

                         DAVID
          Elise!
          The woman turns around.
          And it's her...

                         ELISE
          David?

                         DAVID
          Hi.

                         ELISE
          Wow... How areyou.
          Reeling from the adrenaline; David takes a moment, then:

                         DAVID
          (from the heart)
          I rode the Ml to work every day for
          the last three years hoping one day
          I'd run into you again.
          She's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.

                         ELISE
          Calling would have been easier.

                         DAVID
          I couldn't.

                         ELISE
          Girlfriend wouldn't let you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 43.

                         DAVID
          No girlfriend.
          She looks at him with continued skepticism. But his
          expression is dead serious.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          Can we go somewhere and talk?
          She hesitates. It hurt when he didn't call. She's angry at
          herself for that, but it's the truth.

                         ELISE
          (re: his suit)
          Don't you have to get to work?

                         DAVID
          I just got sick.

                         ELISE
          "I haven't seen you in three years -
          - You make me sick" is not an
          ideal come-on. For the record.
          David smiles. She's softening. A little. His phone
          vibrates. He pulls it out of his pocket.

                         DAVID
          One second.

                         (PICKING UP)
          CharlieT can't make breakfast.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          Why not?

                         DAVID
          And...I might have to push the
          speech.

          CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          What? Are you crazy?!

                         DAVID
          I just ran into Elise.
          He hangs up.

                         ELISE
          You just hung up on your best
          friend.

                         DAVID
          We've known each other since we
          were kids. We have a shorthand.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 44.
          He's not being flip or clever or smooth. He's being matter-
          of-fact. Serious.

                         ELISE
          What speech?

                         DAVID
          Doesn't matter. Let's take a walk.
          His focus on her is absolute. But she's wary of getting
          reeled in again.

                         ELISE
          Where?

                         DAVID
          Somewhere far. We have a lot to
          talk about.

                         ELISE
          I don't think you should cancel
          your speech. What if I don't like
          you at the end of our walk?

                         DAVID
          I'll take my chances.

                         ELISE
          Seri6us1y, my number hasn't
          changed:. Just call me like you
          didn't last time.

                         DAVID
          My-speech will always be there, you
          might not be.

                         ELISE

                         (AMUSED/INDIGNANT)
          I was there, David. You didn't
          callrie!

                         DAVID
          Walk with me and I'll explain that.
          She's still dubious. His phone vibrates. This time he turns
          it off .

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          (a statement of fact)
          I'm not losing you again. I'm not
          letting you out of my sight.

                         ELISE
          Stalker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 45.

                         DAVID
          Can we walk?
          The moment she finally relents, CUT TO:

                         FOLLOWING SHOT
          Polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly
          shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders.

          INT. ELEGANT OFFICE -- DAY

           Mr. Richardson sits at a large desk. The design is Art Deco
          crossed with Albert Speer. Downtown Manhattan is visible out
          the 30th floor window. Richardson's aide enters.

                         MCCRADY
          We have a problem.

          EXT. GRAMERCY -- DAY

          David and Elise walk north.

                         ELISE
          It's been years, David. How do
          you know I don't have a boyfriend?
          Oh, shit. He hasn't even had time to think about that.

                         DAVID
          you have a boyfriend?

                         EL ;E
          Would it-Matter?

                         DAVID

                         (TRAPPED)
          Uh...yeah...

                         ELISE
          So all the stuff about me being in
          your mind constantly for the last
          three years was just talk... The
          truth is you don't have any real
          conviction.

                         DAVID
          It wouldn't matter.

                         ELISE
          So you don't care about being a
          home-wrecker?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 46.

                         DAVID
          Okay... if you were married it would
          matter.

                         ELISE
          Now you're just trying to say what
          you think I want to hear.
          A beat. She lets David twist in the wind...

                         ELISE
          I'm single.
          ON David's face: relief...

                         ELISE
          Now let's hear your bullshit excuse
          for never calling me.

                         DAVID
          I didn't have your number.

                         ELISE
          What?

                         DAVID
          It was taken from me. I was
          mugged.

                         ELISE
          Oh, come on.

                         DAVID
          Your number was in my Wallet and
          they ,:took it.

                         ELISE
          Come on..

                         DAVID
          I'm serious. What else could
          possibly-explain my fawning all
          over you on that bus three years
          ago...and again today and not
          calling you in between?

                         ELISE

                         (DUH)
          Um, you had a girlfriend and you
          felt guilty. I have a thing about
          being lied to, David.

                         DAVID
          I swear to God I didn't have your
          number. I swear on my parents'
          graves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 47.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          I didn't even have a last name to
          try to track you down. Do you know
          how many pages come back when you
          type "Elise" into Google?

                         (BEAT)
          And none of them were you.

                         ELISE
          (after a beat)
          You really are smooth.

                         DAVID
          That's not fair.

                         ELISE
          It's okay. I like it. I probably
          shouldn't, but I do.

                         (BEAT)

          McCrady holds open his Planbook to show Richardson an ever

          Tell me you're kidding. How could
          our Path-analysis miss this?
          McCrady just shakes his head, mystified... Richardson walks
          to the closet and pulls out his fedora:.

          David and Elise walk past Bethesda Fountain.

                         ELISE
          I read somewhere you're running
          again.

                         DAVID
          I haven't announced yet but... soon.

                         ELISE
          I hope I had a little something to
          do with that.

                         DAVID
          That concession speech I gave sure
          did. You had everything to do with
          that.
          Elise smiles.

                         DAVID
          You know entirely too much about me
          given how little I know about you.

                         ELISE
          According to Cosmo I'm supposed to
          keep it that way.

                         DAVID
          According to Maxim, I'm supposed to
          "maintain eye contact and ask you
          what you do for a living."
          It's the first witty comment h6' :s made this time around.

          I'm a dancer.

                         DAVID
          Oh..

                         ELISE
          Not like that, you pervert. In a
          dance company. The. Manhattan
          Modern Ballet.

                         DAVID
          I think you have the wrong idea
          about me.

                         ELISE
          I think it was the first thing that
          crossed your mind.

                         DAVID
          Is there a performance of this
          company coming up that I could
          watch?

                         ELISE
          Actually, we have a show opening
          tomorrow night.

                         DAVID
          I'm there. You hungry yet?

          Yeah...

                         (BEAT)
          But I'm not putting out just
          because you're buying me brunch.

                         DAVID
          We could wait an hour and call it
          lunch.

                         ELISE
          I bet lines like that work wonders
          with the "dancers" you normally
          hang out with.

                         DAVID

          never speak to him again. I've
          studied her file. Her deepest fear

          No, something is wrong. I'm
          already seeing inflection points.
          Off Richardson's surprised look--

                         ELISE
          Ballet is basically impossible to
          do correctly.

                         DAVID
          Why?

                         ELISE
          You just do absurd things. with your
          body. The movement is completely
          unnatural. It requires incredible
          strength in all sorts of random
          muscles. And you have to be born
          with ridiculous amounts of
          flexibility in your hip or you'll
          never be an y good.

          EXT. BOATHOUSE PATIO -- DAY

          McCrady examines his Planbook diagram. With each new update
          of the diagram red "inflection points" move across the pages
          toward a heavy black "present time" line on the right side of
          the right :page
          Richardson points at the red point closest to the present
          tithe ` hrie .

                         RICHARDSON
          What's that?

                         MCCRADY
          If they kiss...

                         RICHARDSON

                         (DISBELIEVING)
          A kiss, that's all it takes?

                         MCCRADY
          A real kiss. But once they do that
          every possible adjustment that's
          strong enough to break them up will
          cause ripples over your limit.

                         RICHARDSON
          If Melton and Morris do their jobs
          right we'll be okay.
          But Richardson is clearly worried.

          INT. MAIN DINING ROOM -- DAY

          David and Elise.

                         ELISE
          In the history of ballet there've
          only been a handful of people who
          actually did ballet the way it's
          supposed to be done. Forme that
          just made it completely addictive.

                         DAVID
          Do you ever get nervous when people
          watch you?

                         ELISE
          Not really. Do you get anxious
          when you make 'a speech?

                         DAVID
          I get more anxious alone in my
          apartment than in front of an
          auditorium full of people.
          Everything's backwards for me.

          (re: Charlie's arrival)

                         CHARLIE
          Does it matter?

          Elise, pleasure to see you again.

                         (TO DAVID)
          There's a crowd of people standing
          around downtown waiting for you.

                         ELISE
          Your speech?

                         CHARLIE
          He's announcing today.

                         ELISE
          At the speech?

                         DAVID
          It's okay.

                         CHARLIE
          What's okay? It's not okay. The
          one thing you can't be this. time
          around is impulsive. That's why
          we're announcing the way we are,

                         THAT'S WHY--

                         ELISE
          God, don't skip this for me.

                         DAVID
          I told you I'm not letting you out
          of my sight.

          David, what the hell?

                         DAVID
          (to Elise, realizing a way
          out of his dilemma)
          Come with me. Come and watch.

                         (SMILING)
          Okay.
          Her phone buzzes with a text message.

                         CHARLIE
          (to both of them)
          Great. Perfect solution. Now,
          let's pay and get you over there.
          Charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check.

                         ELISE
          Now?

                         CHARLIE

          (indicating text message)
          They just moved my dress rehearsal
          to noon.
          David's own sixth sense kicks in. Has he been discovered?

                         DAVID
          We can reschedule the speech.

                         ELISE
          David!

                         CHARLIE

                         (TO ELISE)
          Thank you.
          David looks around for anything out of the ordinary, any sign
          of Richardson or his men. But. they stay out of view. He
          thinks they're not on to him yet.

                         ELISE
          I'll meet you right after the
          rehearsal.

          That's four blocks from where
          you're speaking.
          David reacts: Richardson can't be behind that.

                         CHARLIE
          You can literally walk there after
          the speech.
          David nods, his suspicions fading.

          Richardson and his team watch as David, convinced now he's
          still undiscovered, stands up and heads to the door with
          Charlie and Elise.

                         MCCRADY
          The "four blocks" thing was a
          brilliant move, boss.

          Richardson makes a gesture at the TV by the bar. The picture
          changes (though we can't see to what).
          He then moves a water glass on'their table. The sun hits the
          glass and reflects into the bar area where--

          INT. BAR AREA -- DAY

          --the reflection catches the eye of a 40 year-old woman
          having a coffee at the bar with, her 65 year-old mother.
          Turning so the sun is out of,=hereyes causes the daughter to
          notice the TV: an image of David's famous concession speech
          from three years ago. A screen graphic reads "Announcing
          Today?"
          As the daughter turns back to look at her mother, she notices
          David, over her mom's shoulder...

          David squeezes her hand... and leans in again--

          David pulls back fr`bm Elise, suddenly self-conscious, turns
          to see the 40-year old woman Richardson just manipulated.
          She points at the TV report on David's announcement.

                         40 YEAR-OLD WOMAN
          You have my vote.

                         65 YEAR-OLD WOMAN
          Mine too... and I usually disagree
          with her.

                         DAVID
          Thanks. Thanks a lot.
          David turns back to Elise.

          Whatever happens...I'm not going to
          let anything stand between us this
          time.
          It's such an odd thing to say, if you don't know what David
          has gone through. She gives him a quizzical look. But
          she's also moved by his,tone

                         ELISE
          Okay.:.. I believe you. Of course
          I tend to believe in the wrong
          people. Especially men.
          It's the kind of quip that's more truth than jest.

                         DAVID
          Not this time.
          He leans in to kiss her--

          David kisses Elise on the cheek. But he lingers...
          Then pulls. away without going further...

                         DAVID
          I'll see you in two hours.

          Richardson and his colleagues all breathe a large sigh of
          relief.. .as they watch David leave.

                         MCCRADY
          We're okay...

                         RICHARDSON
          That was way too close. What the
          hell is going on with this case?

          INT. TOWN CAR -- DAY

          David and Charlie ride in the back. Charlie looks at David.

          What?

                         CHARLIE
          I've just never seen you like that.
          David can't possibly explain.

          "I'm going to-postpone my
          announcement to have brunch with a
          woman?" Postpone any speech. I
          know she made an impression on you
          but this is ...
          Charlie just shakes his head, unable to comprehend. A beat.

                         CHARLIE
          "What is it about her?

          David pulls up outside. Hundreds of his supporters and the
          press are waiting for him. He gets out of the car to cheers.

          Richardson stands with McCrady on the upper level of a two-
          story lobby looking out at David arriving for his speech.

          Elise changes into her dance gear. Big smile on her face.
          She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and
          her smile fades. She takes it and puts it in a drawer.
          Her phone vibrates. She has a text message: "Power back on
          at MMB. Rehearsal at noon."

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET FROM RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          McCrady hangs up a silver cell phone and nods at Richardson:
          "it's done." Just then Richardson's phone buzzes. The
          caller ID says: "Mr. Donaldson."

                         RICHARDSON
          Richardson. Yes, sir. Believe me,
          it was a surprise to me too. But
          I think we have it under control.

          INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          Elise and her friend, LAUREN, 20s, stretch between routines.
          An unexpected smile spreads across Elise's face.

          Oh, you're clone. You're gone...

          EXT. RSR FINANCIAL BUILDING -- DAY

          The audience applauds energetically. David nods "thank you"
          and steps away from the lectern they set up. He shakes two
          or three people's hands but then heads inside the building.

          INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          David huddles inside with Charlie. Reporters outside are in
          front of their cameras filing their stories amidst the
          lingering crowd.

                         CHARLIE
          Good Morning America at 7am
          tomorrow, then you have the bankers
          group... David, are you listening?
          David's staring out the window. The sunlight has caught the
          building across the street just right to illuminate
          Richardson and McCrady on the second floor.

          INT. BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET -- DAY


           RICHARDSON (INTO PHONE)

           Richardson hangs up the phone and turns .t look out at David.
          As he does he real zes David can see him.

                         RICHARDSON

          Richardson-steps back out of the sunlight.

                         RICHARDSON
          Get out of the sunlight.
          McCrady, notices David looking, jumps back out of the light.

                         RICHARDSON

                         (FUMING)
          I cannot get a break on this case.

          INT. LOBBY OF RSR FINANCIAL -- DAY

          Charlie is trying to understand what David's staring at.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 61.

                         DAVID
          I have to see Elise now.

                         CHARLIE
          After you go back out there and
          talk to the New York channels--

                         DAVID
          Tomorrow. After GMA.
          He heads for the door. Charlie follows.

                         CHARLIE
          No, we need this on the nightly--
          (catching up to David and

                         STOPPING HIM)
          David...
          Charlie looks at him for a moment, searching for the right
          words to say to a friend...

                         CHARLIE
          Every time we get close.. .you do
          something to derail it.
          A beat. There's a truth to that. David knows it. But--

                         DAVID
          This is different. Trust me, it's
          different.
          David leaves.

          EXT.. WESTBROADWAY AND MURRAY ST -- DAY

          David looks at thepiece of..paper. An.address on West
          Broadway for "Nyman Studios " He's standing at the locked
          front door. No one inside. Richardson is on to him.
          The surprise on his face turns to anger.. .then resolve.
          He dials Elise's number on his cell. Gets voicemail.

                         DAVID

          this message but--

                         JUMP CUT
          David dials 411.

                         DAVID
          Can I have the number for the
          Manhattan Modern Ballet...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 62.
          He looks down to see his phone has zero bars...

          INT. FURNITURE STORE -- DAY

          David goes to the saleswoman.

          EXT. FURNITURE STORE -- DAY

          Through the window we see he saleswoman dial a number ... then
          look at the phone and shrug. It's dead. She and David go
          to her computer. She looks at it, puzzled. It's dead too.
          PULL BACK to REVEAL Richardson and McCrady.

                         MCCRADY
          He's going to go next door:.
          Just then David exits the furniture store and goes next door
          to a clothing store--

                         MCCRADY
          You can't keep.-thephones and

                         JUMP CUT
          David gets to the phone book page that ends with "Manhattan
          Mobile Phone Company." The next page is torn out. David
          slams his fist down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 63.

          EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE -- DAY

          David exits the office to find Richardson on the sidewalk.
          With McCrady nearby.

                         RICHARDSON
          There is an entire world of women
          out there. I thought I made it
          clear this one was off limits.
          David takes off walking.

                         DAVID
          I must have forgotten. It's been a
          while.

                         RICHARDSON
          Doesn't change the fact.
          David looks around, trying to figure out his next move.

                         DAVID
          Why are you so.determined to keep
          us apart?

                         RICHARDSON
          You know: why.

                         DAVID
          The Plan? If there is a Pi ri you
          misread it.

                         RICHARDSON
          There's no misreading what the Plan
          says about you and Elise. It's
          unequivocal.

                         DAVID
          Then your Plan's wrong.

                         RICHARDSON
          Do you realize who wrote this Plan?

                         DAVID
          I don't care.
          Richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall.

                         RICHARDSON
          Well you should. You need to learn
          a little more respect.
          David shoves him off. Looks like he might take a swing at
          Richardson. Then his eye catches the complex diagram that
          McCrady is looking at in his Planbook.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 64.

                         DAVID
          Why are you keeping us apart?

                         RICHARDSON
          Because the Plan calls for it.

                         BECAUSE--

                         DAVID

                         (FLARING)
          You put us together three times--

                         RICHARDSON
          That was chance. That wasn't us.

                         DAVID
          Three times? Bullshit! If I'm not
          supposed to be with her then why do
          I feel like this?

                         RICHARDSON
          It doesn't matter what you feel.
          It matters what's in black and
          white.
          David's ready to explode: at him when he sees something in
          Richardson's eyes. David stops.. .then his whole expression
          changes...

                         DAVID
          You don't know, do you? You don't
          know why they're keeping us
          apart...

                         RICHARDSON

                         (COVERING)
          'It's not something your mind could
          :comprehend.

                         DAVID
          You're in a nice suit but the
          reality is you're just a minion
          aren't you?
          David pushes past Richardson and walks into a busy
          restaurant. McCrady quickly consults his Planbook.

                         MCCRADY
          He's deciding how to--

                         (REALIZING)
          Uh..oh--

          INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY

          David strides in and goes right to a chair. Stands on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 65.

                         DAVID

                         (LOUD)
          Excuse me ladies and gentleman--
          (as people turn and look,

                         RECOGNIZE HIM)
          I'm sorry to disturb your lunch. I
          have a bit of an emergency. Is
          there anybody in this room who's
          ever seen a performance of the
          Manhattan Modern Ballet?

          EXT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT -- DAY

          From outside, Richardson and McCrady watch.

                         RICHARDSON
          Son of a bitch.

                         MCCRADY
          He's smart. He's very smart.
          David exits the restaurant from another door. He hurries
          toward West Broadway.

          EXT. WEST BROADWAY -- DAY

          Not a taxi in sight. David looks for one in vain. Suddenly
          Richardson emerges from a storefront and, goes to David.

                         RICHARDSON
          Maybe you should try the subway.
          David holds him in a steely gaze.

                         DAVID'
          Don't all those cab drivers you're
          diverting have Plans too? What
          about all the other people looking
          for cabs in this part of the city
          right n6t? What about their Plans?
          The ripples must be endless...
          Richardson is taken aback that David has figuredthis out.

                         DAVID
          I don't care what you put in my
          way, I'm not going to give up.
          David walks off, leaving Richardson standing there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 66.

          MINUTES LATER -- DAY
          Richardson and McCrady watch David looking for a taxi at a
          very busy intersection.

                         MCCRADY
          You've got two more minutes keeping
          taxis off West Broadway before--

                         RICHARDSON

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          I need something that's going to
          keep him in place longer--

          EXT. LEONARD ST -- DAY

          On foot, David heads West towards Hudson St. Several taxis
          pass with their roof lights off;. Suddenly, down the street,
          he sees one with his roof light on. He runs for. it when--
          CRASH -- twenty feet in front of him two cars collide. Metal
          crunches and glass breaks. This is no fender bender--

                         DAVID
          Jesus:.,
          (looks for Richardson)
          Is this how far you people will
          go?!
          He rushes toward the accident--

          A few more minutes. I'm sorry. I

          You're not a real cop, are you?

          Doesn't that make you--

                         "POLICE OFFICER"

          He goes to the highest ranking guy on the. scene.

                         DAVID
          I know you heed a statement from
          me, but do I have to stay here to

          DAVS,D
          Thank you. '.Is this man under your

          David turns to see that the "Police Officer" who was
          interviewing him is gone.

          EXT. HUDSON ST -- DAY

          David gets into a taxi.

          And sir, you might have to break
          some traffic laws getting there.
          So take this.
          He hands him a $100 bill. A light that just turned green

                         GOES YELLOW--

                         DAVID

          That's even w r. We have to get

          Richardson looks at the taxi disappearing up Hudson.

                         RICHARDSON
          He's getting out of range!

          INT. HIP CAFE HALLWAY / KITCHEN -- DAY

          Richardson and McCrady rush through the cafe and into the

          manage a word before they throw open the insulated door to
          the COLD PANTRY and run inside.

          refrigerated food. And nothing else. Richardson and McCrady
          have disappeared. The chef blinks.

          INT. ART GALLERY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Richardson and McCrady rush from a storage room to the
          showroom of a fancy art gallery. Patrons stare as they rush
          straight out the front door and onto Gansevoort Street.

          EXT. 8TH AVENUE -- DAY

          David's taxi is hitting all the lights iiow.

          EXT. GANSEVOORT ST -- DAY

          Richardson and McCrady move swiftly down the block.
          Richardson heads up the stairs of a brownstone. Opens the
          door to see a street in Chinatown. He slams the door shut.

          RI.CEARDSON
          Wrong one.
          (thinks)..
          Two doors down. God, I hate
          downtown!

          EXT. 17TH ST -- DAY

          David's taxi heads down 17th from 8th Avenue.

          EXT. 17TH ST DAY

          Richardson and McCrady step out of the service door of a
          l ilding on the corner of 10th Avenue and 17th.
          They can see a taxi, pulling up in front of the Manhattan
          Modern Ballet buildig down the block. They run towards it.

                         (RE: PLANBOOK)
          I've got inflection points. All
          they have to do is catch sight of
          each other this time--

                         RICHARDSON
          What?

          EXT. / INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          David opens the door to Elise's dance company, oblivious to
          Richardson's pursuit.

          INT. DANCE STUDIO LOBBY -- DAY

          LAUREN, is nearby as David speaks to the receptionist. MUSIC
          comes from a door across the room.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Is she expecting you?
          He nods.

                         LAUREN
          I hope you realize how lucky you
          are. I'm the friend. Lauren.

          EXT. 17TH ST -- DAY

          Richardson dons his fedora as he races toward the studio.

                         RICHARDSON
          Can 'I block the front door?

                         NCCRADY
          He's already through Pit.

                         RICHARDS6N
          The next one!

          INT. DANCE STUDIO DAY

          Lauren walks David toward the door with the music behind it.

                         LAUREN
          It goes without saying that I'll
          kill you if you hurt her.

                         (BEAT)
          And by the way, congratulations on
          your announcement.

          EXT. 17TH ST -- DAY

          Richardson and McCrady down the street.

                         MCCRADY
          (re: diagram, confused)
          There are several next ones--

                         RICHARDSON

                         (EXASPERATED)
          I'm blocking them all--
          His hand stretches out (as Harry did early on in film)

                         MCCRADY
          Wait, he's--

          INT. LOBBY / DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          MUSIC pours out as David opens the door. A quarter of the
          way open, the door stops dead.

          EXT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          Richardson grabs the front door and pulls. It's sealed shut.
          It won't budge.

                         WHAT THE-

                         MCCRADY
          Hat! Hat!
          McCrady is behind him He points. at Richardson's fedora,
          which is on the sidewalk. Fell off when he ran. Richardson
          sprints to grab it--

          INT. LOBBY OF DANCE STUDIO --=DAY

          David looks through the narrow space of the open door and
          sees Elise dancing. The piece she's practicing fuses the
          gra e -ballet with the raw emotion of modern. She's ï¿½xl
          eattaking.

                         DAVID
          I'm in serious trouble here...

          EXT. / INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DAY

          Richardson dashes back to the door--

                         MCCRADY

                         (CONSULTING FOLIO)
          Forget it! He's already there...
          Richardson charges into the lobby to see David staring
          through the partially open door to the rehearsal room...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 72.

                         RICHARDSON
          Dammit !
          McCrady's phone buzzes. He pulls it out and looks at the
          caller ID.

                         MCCRADY

                         (DREAD)
          It's Mr. Donaldson.
          Richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in
          his hands.
          David turns just in time to see this. At the same time
          David realizes the door is no longer "stuck."

                         RICHARDSON
          Celebrate while you can. They'll
          just kick it upstairs now You
          have no idea what you're up
          against.
          David just looks at him. He'll deal with that when it
          comes...

                         MCCRADY
          Sir?
          Richardson grabs the phone and answers --.going outside to
          talk.
          David turns back to the dance studio. He opens the door to
          get an unobstructed view of Elisee,. She spins, arches, dips.
          David can't take his eyes off hey`
          When the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes,
          Elise gives David a. little wave. Then they start again.
          David looks back out at Richardson on the street, but he's
          gone..

          TNT. ADJUSTMENT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS -- DUSK
          A defeated Richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs.

          INT. HALLWAY -- DUSK

          Richardson walks down a hallway with an impossibly shiny
          black floor and enters a doorway marked "Mr. Donaldson."

          INT. MR. DONALDSON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DUSK

          Two secretaries look up at him.

          He's waiting for you.

          INT. MR. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK

          Much larger than Richardson's office and on a higher floor.
          MR. DONALDSON, 45, sits at his desk reading a document.
          After a moment he signs it at the bottom and looks up,
          REVEALING Richardson, who is standing awkwardly in front of
          his superior's desk.
          Donaldson motions for him to sit down.

          INT. DANCE STUDIO -- DUSK

          now.
          David talks to Elise, who's showered and dressed

                         DAVID
          You're incredible. How did you get
          that good?

                         ELISE
          It's all I do. It's the only thing
          I ever wante& to be. And I started
          young.

                         AVID
          How young?

                         ELISE
          By third grade I was going every
          day after school.

                         DAVID
          That's a lot of motivation for an
          eight year-old.
          She waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby
          and they exit on to--

          EXT. 17TH ST -- DUSK -- CONTINUOUS


                         ELISE
          We moved around a lot then. Dance
          was kind of my stability.

                         DAVID
          Sure... it was the only constant in
          your life, aside from your
          parents...

          Really more the dance.
          She doesn't make a big deal of it but we get it.

                         DAVID
          Oh...
          David's phone buzzes. Caller ID shows it's Charlie.

                         ELISE
          I take it this is an unauthorized
          social break.

                         DAVID
          I'm a candidate for the US-:Serrate.

                         DAVID
          Couple houtrs while I'm out of touch
          won't:ill him.

                         ELISE
          What's it look like?
          We see the reflection of a dance club in the window.

                         DAVID
          I'm a terrible dancer. I don't
          dance.
          Elise climbs out. David follows.

                         ELISE
          You don't now. By the end of the
          night, you will.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 75.
          They walk towards "Plan B", a hip joint with zebra wallpaper
          and fake palm trees. Salsa music pulses from inside.

                         DAVID
          You're going to teach me to dance
          in one night? Not happening.

                         ELISE
          Are you doubting me?

                         DAVID
          Yes.
          She spins and shoves him against the wall. Forcefully kisses
          him. Then pulls free.

                         ELISE
          Don't.
          She turns and walks into the club. David stands there.

                         DAVID
          Holy shit...

          INT. DONALDSON'S OFFICE -- DUSK

          Richardson sits across from Donaldson.

                         DONALDSON
          The disciplinary rules requ-te me
          to. demote you in rank and re-assign
          yot to a less desirable post.
          Donaldson Â±ingers the document he just signed.

                         DONALDSON
          I'm going-'to interpret those rules
          loosely. I'm going to go easy on
          you because,I feel the deck was
          stacked ,against you.
          In a WIDER shot we see that both Burdensky and Donaldson's
          AIDE sit nearby.

                         DONALDSON
          I'm talking about the intense
          chemistry between them, the
          constant inflection points, and the
          kicker of course: you pulling them
          apart only to have "chance" put
          them back together. Twice. That
          seemed impossible. So I asked
          Burdensky to do some research this
          morning, which he just completed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 76.

                         BURDENSKY
          It seems like these two were meant
          to be together because they were
          meant to be together...

                         RICHARDSON
          What?!

                         BURDENSKY
          Were, in the past, in an earlier
          version of the plan. Actually a
          dozen earlier versions.

                         (BEAT)
          God knows how many artifacts
          pushing them together are left in
          the current plan.

          INT. PLAN B -- DUSK

          A live salsa band has just started. Elise demonstrates Mambo
          for David. Couldn't be farther from the style of dance he
          just saw her rehearse. But she's amazing at it.

                         DAVID
          Serious, serious.trouble...

                         MOMENTS LATER
          Salt, Patron, lime .'-.and two glasses dotin on the bar.

          Nope.

                         ELISE
          Perfect.
          She yanks him onto the dance floor.

          Donaldson, Richardson, Burdensky.

                         RICHARDSON
          Why was it changed?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 77.

                         DONALDSON
          Something important. They went
          from "meant to be together" to "red-
          letter denied relationship" in a
          single Plan revision a few years
          back. As for why, specifically,
          that's apparently above even my pay
          grade...

          INT. PLAN B -- NIGHT

          David and Elise dance. He sucks, but doesn't care. A couple
          of people in the club recognize him and give him thumbs up...

          Burdensky and a dejected Richardson walk down the hall.

                         RICHARDSON
          You spend your whole career hoping
          that one day you'll get a "red-
          letter" case. Something you can
          really make a name for yourself
          with. Finally I get one... and
          it's. .booby-trapped...

          CLOSE ON THE BAR'
          Another set of shot glasses hit the bar. UP to REVEAL David

          Okay, we've al-ready used up an
          hour, we >etter hurry.
          She pills him toward the exit.

                         DAVID
          Hurry where?

          INT. MUSTANG CLUB -- NIGHT

          Elise does a sexy, street variation on a two-step to an up-
          tempo pop-country ballad. David tries to follow along,
          mostly by bobbing his head with the beat. Sort of with the
          beat.

                         ELISE
          You've got to let yourself feel the
          music.

                         DAVID
          I've been told I have trouble
          feeling.

                         ELISE
          Whoever said that hasn't seen you
          speak.

                         DAVID
          That's different. I mean--

                         ELISE
          What?

                         DAVID
          In private. With women AlthOugh
          that might be changing. Is there
          any style of dance you can:'t do?

          EXT. HUNTER'S POINT, QUEENS -- NIGHT

          David and Elise walk from the waterfront to the street.

                         ELISE
          Next stop, the best 80s club in the
          city. You ready?

                         DAVID
          To make an ass of myself for the
          third time in one night? Â§4`r, 6'.

                         ELISE

                         (POINTS)
          Race me to that light. You lose,
          you dance, I watch. You win, I
          dance, you watch

                         DAVID'
          What are'the rules of the race---

                         ELISE
          No rules.

                         DAVID
          Hmmm, could get ugly...
          He looks down an alley as if he's noticed something. When
          she looks, he takes off like a bat out of hell--

                         ELISE
          You bastard!
          He's got a good lead, so he flips around and runs backwards.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 79.

                         DAVID
          Quit complaining and run.
          She catches up. He spins and digs it out. He can't dance,
          but he sure can run. He pulls away and wins.

                         DAVID
          Yes!!!!
          He pumps his arms in a victory dance.

                         ELISE

                         (PISSED SMILE)
          That was good. That was very good.

                         DAVID
          You said "no rules".
          She punches him in the stomach. Hard. He crumples,
          completely unprepared for it.

                         DAVID

                         (IT HURTS)
          Sweet Jesus! Christ on a crutch!

                         ELISE

                         (GIGGLING)
          You said you had trouble feeling.

                         DAVID
          You're insane.

                         ELISE
          We. need a cab.
          He'laughing through the'pain.

                         DAVID
          I'm serious. You're a maniac. You
          should come with a warning label.

                         ELISE
          I do. You just can't see it with
          my clothes on.
          OFF David biting his lip... and PRE-LAPPING the music--

          INT/EXT. A WAREHOUSE CLUB, RED HOOK DOCKS, BROOKLYN -- NIGHT

          2/12/09 80.

                         DAVID
          Doesn't this song make you feel
          like you're at your high school
          prom?

                         ELISE
          I was six when it came out. So,
          not really.
          Brutal. David just shakes his head and smiles as, she pulls
          him to the dance floor.

                         MUSIC
          Baby...1-I-I can't wait--

                         STROBE LIGHTS
          As the song kicks in and David and Elise start dancing... A
          couple of kids next to them notice David and start pointing
          and signaling their approval-
          The kids who first spotted David have alerted a few others.
          More people in the crowd cheer him on.

          EXT. RED HOOK -- NIGHT;

          David and Elise stand on the pier outside the dance club.

                         ELISE
          You grew up over there?
          She indicatesa residential area just behind the docks.

                         DAVID

                         (POINTING)
          I spent any, entire childhood three
          blocks up Carroll Street. We
          didn'.t move-` around a lot.

                         ELISE
          What were you like as a. kid?

                         DAVID
          Before sixth grade I spent about
          half my time in the principal's
          office.

                         ELISE
          You? Really?

                         DAVID
          The only person who spent as much
          time down there as me was a girl I
          had a huge crush on so I didn't
          mind too much.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 82.
          A smile spreads on Elise's face.

                         ELISE
          (re: the docks)
          Did your dad work here?

                         DAVID
          No... My dad filled vending
          machines.

                         ELISE
          And you're going to be a
          senator...

                         DAVID
          After my brother died my Dad wanted
          to get me out of town for a while.
          We went to Washington and the day
          we arrived he took meto the.
          Capitol. We ended up sitting in
          the Senate gallery;,all day.
          (re: Financial' District
          across the river)
          We could see that from the end of
          my block, but-be never once
          encouraged me to go to Wall Street.
          His idol was JFK. He thought
          business guys were selfish.

                         ELISE
          So...areyou doing all this-:f.or
          him?

                         DAVID
          I want to matter. I don't think
          that's just forrhim.
          Elise,. tucks her head into his shoulder.

                         ELISE
          I don't want tonight to mess
          anything..up for you, for the
          campaign.

                         DAVID
          Just make sure I make it to Diane
          Sawyer on time and I'll be fine.
          Elise looks at him for a long beat.

                         ELISE
          You're different... somehow you make
          me believe...

                         DAVID
          Believe what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 83.

                         ELISE
          Just... believe, period.

          EXT. ELISE'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

          PUSH IN on the window of an apartment.

          INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          David and Elise make love, FOCUS so SHALLOW that even their
          faces are not always sharp.

          INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          David and Elise lie together, spent.

                         ELISE
          (vulnerability we barely
          glimpsed before this)
          I don't let people in, David. And
          I never let them in this quickly.
          David pulls her close., He-,can't see her eyes. But we can.
          She's struggling with something more...

                         ELISE
          I haven'::t lead a perfect life

                         DAVID
          I. don't want perfect.,.

          ELISE. ,
          :(emotion,weI9ing)
          I'm trying to say .I'm not sure
          somebody running. for office can
          have, me in their life.
          David turns her around so he can see her face, so he knows
          for sure she hears this:

                         DAVID
          I haven't stopped thinking about
          you since the moment I met you. I
          want you in my life--

                         ELISE
          There are skeletons in my closet,
          David. The kind that--

                         DAVID
          Listen to me--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 84.

                         ELISE
          The kind that people use against--

                         DAVID
          Elise, listen! I don't care.
          We'll work it out... I've spent my
          whole life wondering why it takes
          auditoriums of people to fill the
          empty space inside me. Then I met
          you...and realized it doesn't.
          She looks at him. He means it.

                         ELISE
          You scare me.

                         DAVID
          (after a beat)
          That wasn't the effect I was going
          for...
          She smiles...then laughs out-loud--

          SAME -- LATER
          David and Eliseirsleep peacefully. REVEAL MR. THOMPSON, late

                          THOM BON

          7 Thompson's aides seem surprised by the answer.

           INT. ELISE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING -- FRIDAY

          David wakes to find Elise looking at him.

                         DAVID
          You been up long?

                         ELISE
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 85.

                         DAVID
          Did you wake up in. the middle of
          the night?

                         ELISE
          Slept straight through.

                         DAVID
          I thought you never sleep through.

                         ELISE
          I don't.

                         (BEAT)
          I told you, you scare me.
          He kisses her.

                         DAVID
          I won't hurt you.
          They kiss more... and then get swept up by it...

                         LATER
           They lie in bed, post-coital, drained. Blissful. Until the
          phone rings. It's 6:17 am. Early for a call.

                         ELISE
          Hello? :Why, are you calling?

                         (LISTENS)
          No...I... . Look, I have to go...
          She hangs up. David looks at her.

                         DAVID
          What's wrong..

                         ELISE
          That was my , ex. Adrian.

                         DAVID
          Oh... I didn't-- I guess we hadn't
          gotten to that stuff yet...

                         ELISE
          He hasn't called since we broke up.

                         DAVID
          How long?

                         ELISE
          Three months.

                         DAVID
          Was it serious?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 86.
          An awkward beat. Elise opts for complete honesty.

                         ELISE
          We were engaged.

                         DAVID
          What happened?
          Complete honesty.

                         ELISE
          He left...
          David can feel this in the pit of his stomach now.

                         DAVID
          What an idiot.

                         ELISE
          You don't know me that well yet.
          You're still in the wishful
          thinking phase.

                         (BEAT)
          Truth is I should.;-Have left him a
          long time before he left me. It
          was a ,ain' l relationship. It
          hurt tb be i-h it every day.

                         DAVID
          But it was:h'ard to leave.

                         ELISE
          H& knew what buttons., tb push.

                         DAVID `'
          that him?
          DtTid paints at pica re of Elise with an attractive man, arms
          wound each other. lis'e looks surprised, shocked even, to
          tY%'e photo on her b okcase. She nods.

                         ELISE
          David... . It's not... It's over
          between us. Completely over...I
          want to be clear about that. I'm
          pretty sure yesterday was the most
          perfect day I've ever had.

                         DAVID
          Me too.
          David looks at the clock.

                         DAVID
          I have this Diane Sawyer interview.

          It comes out awkward.

                         ELISE
          I know.
          So did that. They look at each other. Then David reaches
          for his clothes--

                         ELISE
          Can I come? My dress rehearsal's
          not until nine.
          David's face lights up.

                         ELISE
          I'm afraid if I let you out of my
          sight. . .you know...I might never
          see you again...
          A smile creeps across his face...

          You've overcome enormous obstacles
          in your life and risen to-such
          heights so quickly... People are
          fascinated by you.

                         DAVID
          Only people who haven't spent
          enough time with ' me to know the
          'truth.

          INT. GREEN ROOM .-- DAY-

          Elise watches the:nterview on a big monitor. A soundproof
          window allows her tb see directly into the studio.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          As a speaker and politician you've
          been repeatedly compared to JFK.

                         DAVID
          By my campaign manager mostly.

          DIANE SAWYER (ON TV)

                         (GRINS)
          You're the youngest person ever
          elected to Congress. Which you
          celebrated by getting in a bar
          fight on inauguration night.

          With a childhood friend. So I
          don't think that counts. And,
          truthfully, that's how we celebrate
          things we're I'm from.

          INT. STUDIO -- DAY


                         DIANE SAWYER
          (grinning bigger now)
          Let's just say you have a habit of
          getting into the press for...other
          uniquely human things as well--

                         DAVID
          that a euphemism, Diane?
          She laughs.

                         DIANE SAWYER

          things they've done Yoti,crack,
          jokes about them. You embrace,
          them. Especially since your.;,
          concession speech thr
          ee years ago
          which started as a `sstd-up routine
          and brought tears to my,eyes by the
          .,end when you talked about losing
          Your mother to Lancer and then your
          older brother,,Pdt, to an overdose,
          both whei.you:were only ten years
          old.

          :,INT. STUDIO -- DAY


                         DAVID
          I think Americans are tired of
          electing automatons whose every
          word and move is stage-managed so
          as not to offend anyone. I think
          they want somebody who doesn't hide
          who he is or what he really
          believes. I guess I'm hoping they
          want to elect someone who's
          actually like them.

                         (LAUGHS)
          But I could be very wrong about
          that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 89.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          And if you are?

                         DAVID
          You'd be surprised at the number of
          underwear companies that have
          approached me to be their
          spokesman.
          Diane bursts out laughing. The floor techs are laughing too.

          INT. GREEN ROOM -- DAY

          And so is Elise. She's completely smitten. ON THE TV:
          Diane turns to the camera, trying to stop laughing.

          DIANE SAWYER (ON TV)
          Unfortunately, we're out of time.
          David Norris, announced his
          candidacy for US Senate yesterday.
          Thanks for stopping by.
          It goes to commercial.

          INT. STUDIO -- DAY

          David stays to speak to Diane for a moment-as we MOVE to
          find a stagehand'who is shifting the position of one of the
          big video cameras sed to tape the show. We catch a glimpse
          of his face and see it's Thompson's aide.
          INT<. Gk 2N- R0014 -- DAY
          The- "stagehand" moves thecamera so it's blocking the window
          giving Elise line-of sight to David and Diane.
          Just. then a man with an-.ABC ID enters the room to speak to
          Elise. (We only see his lower half.)

                         ABC ID
          Ma'am, Congressman Norris asked me
          to give you a message.
          We MOVE UP from his ID to REVEAL that the man is another one
          of Thompson's aides.

          THOMPSON AIDE #2 (ABC ID)
          He was just called into a meeting
          that he says is urgent. He says
          he'll call you later and see you at
          your show tonight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 90.

          INT. STUDIO -- DAY

          David and Diane say goodbye to each other. He salutes the
          floor staff, who actually applaud. They love him.

                         DIANE SAWYER
          (to David, re: earpiece)
          They're saying your girlfriend --
          can we call her that? Is this one
          going to last more than a month?

                         DAVID
          You can call her that. And yes.
          Definitely.
          David is looking at a text from Elise as he speaks. It says:
          "I want to go to bed with you."

                         DIANE SAWYER
          They're saying she's getting a tour
          of the control room in studio C.
          Can somebody take Congressman
          Norris to studio C?
          Thompson's aide signals David to follow him. David does.
          They walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor.

          INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

          Thompson's aide leads him through a heavy door marked "Studio
          C" into a, vestibule and then through another heavy door into--

          INT. '':STUDIO C" -- DAY

           A partially-built set in the center of an empty stage. Elise
           isn't here. Thompson's aide feigns surprise.

           T HOMPSON'S AIDE #2
           They said she was here... . Hang on.
          David pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal. He
          looks up to see Thompson's aide exit through the stage door.
          It suddenly clicks for David, and he rushes to the door.
          Yanks on it. It's locked.

                         DAVID
          God dammit!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 91.

          INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

          Through the thick window of the outer door we can see David
          pounding on the window of the inner door.
          But we can't hear a sound.
          PULL BACK to REVEAL Thompson's aide removing the"Studio C"
          placard. Beneath is the true designation: "Studio D."
          PAN to REVEAL three Thompson aides removing a false wall that
          was hiding a bunch of construction equipment and setting up
          "No Entry -- Construction Zone" signs.

          QUICK CUTS -- FRANTIC HANDHELD
          1) David across the room tugs on another exit. It's locked.
          2) David pulls a fire alarm. Nothing.
          3) David slams on the door with a two-by-four.

          LONGER CUTS -- COMPOSED DOLLY SHOTS
          1) Diane Sawyet talks about the issue of the day as we pull
          back and show her. co-hosts on the couch.
          2) Elise arrives in the lobby of the Manhattan Modern Ballet
          for her company's dress rehearsal.

          INT STUDIO D (EARLIER ".STUDIO'.C") -- DAY
           David sits. His tie..loose now. His jacket off. He glances
          at his blackberry. the time reads 4:13 pm. He yells in
          frustration.

                         VOICE
          If people could hear you out there
          it wouldn't be a very good
          soundstage, would it?
          David turns to see Thompson, in the now familiar dark suit
          and fedora.

                         THOMPSON
          My name's Thompson.

                         DAVID
          What happened to Free Will?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 92.

                         THOMPSON
          Who said anything about Free Will?
          David stares back at him.

                         THOMPSON
          You know, we actually tried Free
          Will before. After taking you from
          hunting and gathering to the height
          of the Roman Empire we stepped back
          to see how you'd do on your own.
          You gave us the Dark Ages -- for
          five centuries -- until finally we:
          decided we should come back in.

                         (BEAT)
          The Chairman thought maybe we just
          needed to do a better job of
          teaching you how to ride the bike
          before we took the training wheels
          off again. So we gave you the
          Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the
          Scientific Revoluton.:ï¿½we spent
          six hundred years tempering your
          passions with reason.,then in 1910
          we stepped ba ï¿½c again. Within
          fifty yearsï¿½you brought us World
          War I, the lepre'ssion, Fascism, the
          Holocaust ani capped it off by
          bringingtheentire planet to the
          brink of destruction in the Cuban
          Missile Crisis. A decisiOfl was
          taken atthat point that we' should
          stop in again before Â±ou did
          _soittething even we Cduldn't fix.

                         (BEAT)
          You on't have_ Free Will, David,
          you have the appearance of Free
          =Will.

                         DAVID
          You expect me.'to believe that?

                         THOMPSON

                         (BORED SHRUG)
          You have Free Will over what tie
          you pick in the morning, or what
          beverage to order at lunch. But
          humanity just isn't mature enough
          to have control over the important
          things.

                         DAVID
          If you're in control of the
          important things then you're
          incompetent cause when I look
          around at the world these days it
          seems pretty fucked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 93.

                         THOMPSON
          It's still here. If we'd left
          things in your hands, it wouldn't
          be.

                         DAVID
          Why are you trying to keep me from
          Elise? Or are you just another
          lackey who doesn't really know?
          Thompson studies David for a long beat. Then decides it's
          time to level with him.

                         THOMPSON
          We put Elise in front of you three
          years ago to inspire you to, .g `ve
          that speech -- the speech that
          pulled you back from the brink of
          oblivion and, overnight, itiade.you
          the front runner for this coming
          election. The intervention on
          Charlie was to prevent the hedge
          fund you had just become vice
          chairman of from going belly up in
          the sub-prime=crisis, bringing two
          major banks down. with it, arid in ,
          the process making you unelectable.
          David blinks. Tries to, process this...
           : .bAVID
          Are you s aying you warit me to win
           this election?

          THOMP50N,
          This 'one and six mom, after it.
          And t'm not just talking about
          `elections ' for Senate.
          lowly dawns on David what Thompson is saying...

                         THOMPSON
          You can matter, David. Really
          matter. What you wanted your whole
          life. What your father wanted when
          he took you to the Senate gallery
          when you were ten. What your
          brother wanted when he made you
          promise, the day before he
          overdosed, that you wouldn't be
          like him.

                         DAVID
          Stop. Don't tell me this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 94.

                         THOMPSON
          Why do you think you have that
          yearning to be in front of
          people. . .and that terrible
          emptiness when you're not?

                         DAVID
          Stop.

                         THOMPSON
          David you are meant to change the
          world. But that doesn't happen if
          you stay with her.

                         DAVID
          Why does it matter to you who I
          love? Some skeleton of hers `is so
          bad I won't get elected? I don't
          believe that!

                         THOMPSON
          It's not about her-:..it's about
          you, what being with her does to

                         YOU -

                         DAVID-
          What does that mean?! I'm better
          with her than I ever was alone.,
          You just said it. That speech--

                         1HOMPSON
          Yes. The speech... Put it this
          wad: in small doses, Elise was the
          cure. But in large doses... When
          you're enthralledwith someone she
          ' rubs off on you:.

                         DA ID
          Stop. Just: stop.

                         THOMPSON

                         DAVID
          Stop talking. It's not working.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm a politician. I spend my life
          with professional liars. With
          people who decide what they want
          and then figure out the story they
          have to tell to get it.

                         THOMPSON
          Why do you refuse to accept what
          should be completely obvious by
          now? You've seen what we can do.
          You can't doubt we are who we say
          we are.

                         DAVID
          I don't care who you are. I don't
          care who's orders you're following.

                         THOMPSON
          You can't outrun your fate, David.

          Who said anything about running.

                         THOMPSON
          Maybe we should just reset you.

                         DAVID
          We both know if you could have we
          wouldn't be standing here having
          this conversation...
          Thompson stares back. He's never dealt with such
          temerity...

                         THOMPSON
          You fight us, we will take
          everything from you.

                         DAVID
          You already did once.' And I'm
          still standing...

                         (BEAT)
          always knew you were out there.
          We all do. It's the one thing we
          have in common. Whether we call
          it God or the Devil or Fate we all
          know you're out there, fucking with
          us...

                         THOMPSON
          You'd still be living in caves if
          it weren't for us.

                         DAVID

                         (WELLING EMOTION)
          You crush our dreams because they
          don't fit with your Plan. Your
          Plan that has no space for me
          falling in love but somehow has
          room for Tsunamis and cyclones and
          Darfur and AIDS. Fuck your plan.
          I reject it. I reject you.

          2/12/09 96.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          The only thing we have in this
          fucked up world are the choices we
          make. And there's nothing you can
          do to me that will get me sign them
          away.

                         (BEAT)
          Kill me. Or erase me. Or let me
          go.
          Thompson stares back at him, dumbfounded. A long silence,

                         THEN:

                         THOMPSON
          It's 6:20. If you leave now,
          you'll make Elise's show.
          David's eyebrows go up. Huh? Thompson is letting him go?

          EXT. GOOD MORNING AMERICA STUDIOS: .--..DUSK

          David jumps into a taxi.

          INT. TAXI -- DUSK

           David sits in the back seat, taking everything in, turning it
           over and over in his head... .'

          INT. THEATER -- ELISE'S DANCE COMPAMY

          Elise and twb of her colleagues "finish a dance piece. The
          audience explodes into applause.
          The house lights come up half way as the stage is readied for
          the next piece,. David is startled to see that the man in the
          aisle seat next to-him is Thompson.

                         T-4 MPSON
          She's a beautiful dancer.

                         DAVID
          What do you want?

                         THOMPSON
          There's one more piece to all this
          I haven't told you. I guess I
          didn't have the heart. If you stay
          with her, it doesn't just kill your
          dreams, it kills hers.

                         DAVID
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 97.

                         THOMPSON
          Elise is about to become one of the
          most famous dancers in the
          country... and eventually one of the
          greatest choreographers in the
          world.

                         (BEAT)
          If she stays with you... she ends up
          teaching dance to eight year-olds.

                         DAVID
          I don't believe you. I thought we
          already established that.
          A beat.

                         THOMPSON
          When you look back at all this,
          David, just remember, we tried to
          reason with you.
          Thompson gets up and leaves...just as the lights go down for
          the next dance.
          David watches him go...then turns around just in time to
          catch Elise's entrance into the dance -- a graceful jump.
          When she lands, her ankle cracks, and she falls. The
          audience gasps.
          INSERT: a floor board tilted oddly. It goes back to normal.
          FIND THOMPSON: His hand slightly outstretched.
          THE AUDIENCE instantly knows something is wrong. David jumps
          up and runs down to the.: stage door. A dancer comes from off
          stage and helps Elise off the floor as the show continues.

          INT BACK STAGE -- NIGHT
          .A company staff member is examining Elise's ankle while the
          show goes on.
          David arrives. Sees Elise's face. Tears streaming down her
          cheeks. Seeing David...

                         ELISE
          If it's broken...my career's over.

                         DAVID
          Don't say that. Don't.

          INT. TAXI -- NIGHT

           The taxi rushes to the hospital. David holds her. Silently
          trying to comfort her. But he can't look at her.

          EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

          David carries her from the taxi into the emergency room...

          INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

          David sits in a black chair, alone, staring at the floor.

          INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT

          Elise lies on an exam table as -a tech x-rays her ankle.

          INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM NIGHT

          David is still staring at the floor. He looks-up to see
          Thompson.

                         THOMPSON
          I always hear people saying "you
          yourself for what can't bla M4'
          hpens fih other people," but in
          this case, really, you can.
          David stands up...
           . and punnhesThompson in `the face.
          h T ompson is knocked onto his ass.
          People in the waiting room stare at David. Almost everyone
          here knows his fade. He looks at them, unable to summon his
          usual wit.

                         THOMPSON
          This is what you do, David.

                         (GETTING UP)
          This is what you did the first
          night you got elected. This is
          what you did at that college
          reunion. We give you opportunities
          people would kill for and you
          squander them with impulse. It
          doesn't take a genius to see Elise
          isn't exactly going to help you
          with that.

                         THOMPSON (CONT'D)
          You want to know why you can't have
          her? Look in the mirror.
          Thompson leaves.

          INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- NIGHT

          More X-rays of Elise's ankle. An orthopedic surgeon enters
          and examines the images on the computer screen.
          Elise, her face, still red and tear stained tries to read the

                         SURGEON'S FACE

                         ELISE
          How bad is it?
          The surgeon turns to her with a classic doctor's detachment:

                         SURGEON

                         ELISE--

          EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD -- NIGHT

          David sits alone on a bench. Thompson arrives.

                         THOMPSON
          You're an educated man. You've
          read the Greek tragedies`. In the
          end Fate always wins...
          David looks back at him in steely silence.

                         THOMPSON
          It a sprain.

                         DAVID
          Really?

                         THOMPSON
          This time.

                         (BEAT')
          Do you really want to watch her
          lose the only thing she's ever
          cared about? You just got the
          tiniest taste of what that looks
          like...
          The thought makes David ill.

                         THOMPSON
          Walk away. If you truly love her,
          walk away. She'll hate you for
          it...but that way she'll be able to
          let you go quickly. You can give
          her that at least.

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

          David stands alone. Stares at the floor. Finally
          confronting the fact that he can't beat the forces arrayed
          against him. Finally ready to make the choice being forced
          upon him...

          INT. HOSPITAL EXAM ROOM -- DAY

          David enters to find Elise with a huge smile on her face.

                         ELISE
          It's a sprain! It's just a sprain!
          David gives her a tight hug.

                         ELISE
          It's going to be okay. The doctor
          said it would heal in' a
          month. . .maybe even less.

                         DAVID
          You're going to: be fine.

                         ELISE
          They want to do an MRI...to assess
          the ligament. damage but.: -.
          They break from them hug.

                         DAVID
          It's; going to be fine. And as
          incredible of a dancer as you
          already are, yot're just going to
          get better and better...
          DavidV;embraces her again, so she won't see the tears welling
          in his eyes.

                         DAVID
          I...I have to go make a few calls.
          His voice cracks. Elise notices.

                         ELISE
          You okay?

                         DAVID
          I'm just...happy for you...

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

          David walks down a long corridor away from Elise's room.

          EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

          David exits the building. Thompson is waiting by the door.

                         THOMPSON
          You're doing the right thing,
          David. Not just for her, and the
          world. . .but for yourself.
          David looks at him for a beat, then turns and walks away into
          the night.

          FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. DINER -- UPSTATE NEW YORK -- MORNING

          How's he doing?

                         CAMPAIGN AIDE

          The aide hands Charlie a stack of papers: three local papers,
          the Times, the Journal, and the three big NYC tabloids.

                         CHARLIE

          The aide leaves. Charlie glances at the front page of the
          Times, then reaches for the New York / Region section. As he
          does the front page of the Arts section catches his eye.
          There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split,"
          accompanying an article titled "Dance Takes a Quantum Leap."
          Charlie glances through the window at David who is climbing
          down from the pickup truck to applause from his parking lot
          audience.

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- MORNING

          David shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his
          speech. They really do love him.

          INT. DINER, UPSTATE NEW YORK MORNING

          Charlie reads the New York Times. article. It begins:
          "Once in a generation a piece is created of
          such astounding originality and virtuosity
          that it single-handedly reshapes. the. world of
          dance."

          shaking handb and allowing his picture to be taken.

          David sits down with Charlie.

                         DAVID
          I'm started.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm going to show you this because
          you'd find out eventually and
          because I want to be here when you
          do.
          Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it.
          Elise's photo has a noticeable impact on David. He glances
          at the article for a moment.
          Then Charlie points down near the bottom, at a particular

                         SENTENCE:

          David stares at the words...

                         CHARLIE
          David?
          (off no response)
          David?

                         DAVID
          I think I need... I...

                         CHARLIE
          Take a day off. Take a couple.
          We're sixteen points up.

                         DAVID

                         (HOLLOWED OUT)
          Even I can't blow a lead that big.

          EXT. RED HOOK, BROOKLYN NIGHT

          It's pouring rain. David walks down Carroll Street. Most of
          the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs.
          Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is
          clearly in the early'stages of gentrification.
          David pays particular attention to one row house as he passes
          by. Was this his house?

          EXT. / INT. NEIGHBORHOOD DAR -- NIGHT

          There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in
          the window. David enters this classic dive bar and goes to
          the bartender.

                         DAVID
          Do you still serve neighborhood
          guys here or just the tourists?
          The bartender smiles big. A couple people at the bar notice
          him. Then others notice and they start whooping it up for
          him. He doesn't know any of them-but they sure know him.

          EXT. RED HOOK DOCKS -- NIGHT

          David sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers,
          holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag.

          There are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off
          the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls.
          A figure in a suit approaches David from behind. He turns
          to see the man.

                         DAVID
          Why are you here?
          REVERSE to REVEAL Harry, in a suit and raincoat.

                         HARRY
          I would have come earlier but I had
          to wait for the rain.
          (off David's confusion)
          Water interferes with their ability
          to sense your decision tree.
          That's why we met on a boat last
          time.

                         (BEAT)
          I guess I'm here to set the record
          straight.

                         DAVID
          About what?

                         HARRY-
          Thompson was lying when he said
          they couldn't let you be with 8lise
          because :it would bring out your
          reckless side.

                         DAVID
          Why, then? Why do they care so
          much?

                         HARRY
          8ecause.,..she's enough, David. If
          you have =her r tau rtt .ght not need to
          fill the d side you with votes
          and ataplause'and dreams of one day
          becoming p sident...
          if Harry has:looked straight into David's soul.

                         HARRY
          I've watched you a long time.
          They're right to want you in the
          White House. It would be good for
          the world. That's important but it
          can't be the only thing that
          matters.

                         DAVID
          Why are you so different than they
          are?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 105.
          A long beat, then:

                         HARRY
          You know, your Dad was a smart man.
          He could have been a lot more --
          and he wanted to be. So did your
          brother. But the Plan didn't call
          for that.
          This hits David hard.

                         HARRY
          In my job, you implement the
          Plan...

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          And most of the time.. .you don't
          even know why...

                         (BEAT)
          I'm sorry...

                         DAVID
          My mom?

                         HARRY
          That wasn't me... that wasn't us at
          all.
           David takes all this in. After a;long be t he takes a drink.
           Then he offers the bottle to Harry, who h a esitates, then takes
          a drink as well.

                         DAVID
          When Thompson told methe choice
          as Elise or the White House I
          barely hesitated.

                         D1 ID
          But the trt t i `is after making that
          choice I went into a free-fall...
          Don't get=me wrong, it killed me to
          see Thompson hurt her...but I used
          it as an excuse. I think I left
          her more to save my career than
          hers.

                         (STRUGGLING)
          Thompson wasn't lying. The press is
          already talking about me as a
          future president. I'm phoning in
          my speeches and I'm still sixteen
          points up in the polls.

                         HARRY
          The public loves you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 106.

                         DAVID
          Before I met Elise that was all
          that mattered. Now I hardly
          notice. She's all I think about.

                         (BEAT)
          Do you know where she's getting
          married?

                         HARRY
          Front of a judge. Tomorrow
          morning.

                          DAVID
          Is she happy with him? Tell me she
          is and I'll walk away.

                          HARRY
           Thompson won't let you get near
          that courthouse.

                         DAVID
          Harry... is she happy?

                         HARRY
          No.
          A beat.

                         DW-ID
          I have to get her back..
          Harry knows how unlikely that is.

                         DAVID
          Will you help me:ï¿½ Just help me
          get to her...

                         HARDY
          They'll sense )tOu coming a mile
          away.'

                         DAVID
          What if Icould move as fast as you
          can?

                         HARRY
          What do you mean?

                         DAVID
          Teach me about the doors.

                         HARRY
          How do you know about that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 107.

                         DAVID
          The first day, after they caught
          me, they carried me through one.I
          thought it was a hallucination at
          first. Eventually I realized it's
          how you move around so fast.
          (off Harry's reluctance)
          If you don't want to help me
          because of what they'll do to
          you...okay, that's your choice.
          But if this is about protecting me
          then shouldn't the choice be mine?

                         HARRY
          Do you have any idea how
          complicated it is to navigate
          through those doors... how many
          thousands of permutations there are
          in even a simple several block
          journey?

                         DAVID
          You know, when I do town hall
          meetings I usually get introduced
          to forty or fifty people between
          when I walk, through' the door and
          when I start speaking. But when
          I'm done with the speech I can call
          on each one of them by `game.
          A beat...

                         HARRY
          I've seen you do that
          (taking tl leap )
          The rain is supposed to stop in the
          nexthou'r. We're going to need all
          night to do this. And we're going
          to need aplace surrounded by water
          to do it.

                         MOMENTS LATER
          Harry and David stand outside a door to a dock office at the
          end of the pier. Harry dons his hat.

                         HARRY
          Put your hand on my shoulder. And
          don't let go until we've crossed
          the threshold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 108.
          David complies. Harry opens the door.

                         DAVID
          Are they ever locked?

                         HARRY
          Maybe if you have a defective hat.
          They step through the door and onto--

          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS -- NIGHT

          Harry notices as the rain slows to a drizzle.

                         HARRY
          Hurry.
          Harry runs David to the front dooraf a brownstone. Opens
          the door. They move through i into--

          INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING: STATION -- NIGHT

          Harry stops. David takes-his hand off Harry's shoulder.
          Still amazed by what they just did.

                         HARRY
          We're underneath Canal Street,
          which c as ,,A canal before rt, was a
          street. This is the jcity's':pumping
          station for downtown Manhattan.
          We're ten blocks from the
          courthouse.

          EXT. / INT. ELISE'S DANCE'.- COMPANY -- NIGHT


                         -
          Elise enters, smiles at the receptionist.

                         ELISE
          Floor open?

                         RECEPTIONIST
          (seeing Elise's red eyes)
          You okay, sweetie?

                         ELISE
          I just feel like being on the
          floor.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Everything still on for tomorrow?
          Elise nods, trying to cover her ambivalence.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 109.

          INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT

          MUSIC BEGINS: something that recalls the sensei-pupil scenes
          in martial arts movies, but at the same time something fluid
          and lyrical (e.g. Yoshida Brothers, "Beyond the Deep Sea.")
          Harry rolls out a block-by-block map of lower Manhattan.
          There are intricate red pen markings all over the map..

                         HARRY
          Lower Manhattan is a nightmare.
          Layer upon layer of substrate --
          that's what we call the system of
          doors -- has been added over time.
          That makes it a lot more complex to
          navigate down here than it is
          uptown. And a lot slower.
          Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and
          exterior, all below Canal Street.

                         HARRY
          You ready?

                         DAVID
          Let's go.
          Harry smiles and hblds,.up a photograph of.the Manhattan
          County Court Building in Foley Squa:e:.

                         HARRY
          Your destination. Courtroom Six.

          INT ` ELISE'S DICE COMPANY-'; -- NIGHT
          The MUSIC CONTINUES". SOURCE music here-. Elise dances to
          it, freestyle. The fluidity and extension of ballet, but
          none of its formality or stiffness.

          INT. UNDERGROUND PUMPING STATION -- NIGHT


                         DAVID
          (struggling to remember)
          North Moore St. Just south of the
          coffee shop... Red door. I come out
          on Broadway, near Leonard St.
          Harry looks at a photo of what David just described.

                         HARRY
          Good. Keep going.

          (eyes closed, trying to

                         PICTURE IT)
          There's an alley in front of me.
          Third door on--

                         HARRY
          Thompson's there.

                         DAVID
          Okay ...so...
          (thinks, then has it)
          I hightail it East-to Lafayette
          no, it's Crosby Street there.
          INT. DANCE COMPANY -- Nit;HT

           Thompson is gong to pull out all

           don't care if u'see a auv wearing

          them.

                         'DAVID
          Okay, you said he's right in front
          of me, right?
          Harry nods.

                         DAVID
          I'd knock the Yankees cap off his
          head and go through the door before
          he has a chance to pick it up...
          A thinsmile forms on Harry's face and grows...

                         DAVID
          How am I doing?

                         HARRY
          Don't get cocky. You know ten
          permutations out of ten thousand.
          Get back to work.

                         MONTAGE
          Harry drilling David with photd'after photo of Manhattan
          doors INTERCUT with Elise dancing ...until she finally quits
          from physical and emotional exhaustion.

          INT. UNDERGROUNDPUMPING STATION -- NIGHT.

          David rubs his head. He's exhausted-too. Mentally.

                         HARRY
          Yourbrain can only put so much in
          at once. Take- a brreak.
          Da :} , nods. His eyg6,0s' to: Harry' s leather Planbook. He
           btio#ts to it -- a question: can he look at it., Harry opens
           tt up to a page in the middle. David's eyes look over the
           impossibly complex circ$t diagram.

                         DAVID
          Could I ever learn to read that?
          Harry shakes his head. Impossible.

                         DAVID
          No matter how hard I tried?

                         HARRY
          For the same reason you can't
          breathe underwater or flap your
          arms and fly. You're not built to
          do it.

          Is that me?

                         HARRY
          Elise. Her decision tree. What it
          was a few hours ago, before the
          rain, before we were down here.
          David looks at it, then looks away.

                         DAVID
          I want to ask you what it
          says.. .what she's thinking.. .bit
          somehow that feels ...wrong.

                         HARRY
          You know what she's thinkin-g,'David
          -- as much as you need to know.
          The rest ...well...you're`built to
          feel that.

          EXT. DANCE COMPANY -- NIGHT

          Elise exits to the street, pulls a scarf around her neck..

          David closes the P14nbook.

                         HARRY
          ready to get back to work?
          Sometl`ing about that strikes Harry...

                         HARRY
          Your father used to say that.
          Off David's reaction--

          SLAM! SLAM! The door cracks--

                         ELISE
          Jesus, David!. What's going on?!
          David is impossibly calm. He puts his hat back on.

                         DAVID
          I'm going to: show you.
          He takes Elise's hand, opens the bathroom door, and walks her
          across the threshold into--

          EXT . ;SOHO -- DAY
          Davidand Elise step? thhgtgh. a door onto a street in Soho.
          She stops. Awed. Unable to speak.

                         DAVID
          Come on... We need to lose them.
          David walks her across the street and picks a door at random,

                         OPENS IT--

          EXT. DOOR -- DAY

          David and Elise exit through a door. Her jaw drops.
          REVERSE TO REVEAL Central Park's Sheep Meadow spread before
          them. (They've exited from the building on its north edge).
          Elise steps out onto the grass, touches it, falls to her
          knees in the rain, completely overwhelmed...

          INT. 5TH FLOOR LOBBY / INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY

          A bevy of men in hats push the ladies room door open and rush
          in. They're shocked to see it's empty...

          EXT. SHEEP'S MEADOW -- DAY

          Eliselooks at David

                         DAVID
          The rain slows them down but they
          can track us. We have two orthree
          minutes. Maybe less.
          Elise is still speechless. He takes her hand.

                         DAVID
          The ten year-old in me always mixed
          up winning elections with being
          loved. Then I met` you;,..

                         (BEAT)
          The thing is, if they'd let me be
          with you I wouldn'tk have left
          politipe. t, just would have beef
          in it, or. all the right reasons.
          David pauses for a moment. He can see this' so clearly in his
          head. How can it notbe right?

                         DAVID
          Now you know. Youknota everything.
          And you have to leave mitie.

          They'll take` dance from you. You
          saw what they-'did before.
          'fihe foundations of her world have just collapsed... but
          somehow she pulls herself together to say this:

                         ELISE
          No.

                         DAVID
          You're not safe with me. If you

                         DON'T LEAVE--
          She puts her finger to his lip. Shhhh...

                         ELISE
          It doesn't make any sense but,
          right now I feel safer than I've
          ever felt before.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm staying...

          INT. THE CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

          The Chairman's Office is the size of the reading room at the
          New York Public Library. Thirty foot high.ceilings. A dozen
          assistants perform various tasks very quietly, giving it more
          the feel of a papal court, than a corporate office.
          We see THE CHAIRMAN from behind only ..but we can still tell
          he is utterly calm and in complete control.
          An aide comes to The Chairman's--desk,.sets two open leather
          folios in front of him.

          AIDE TO-HE'"CHAIRMAN
          Mr. Thompson has made an emergency
          request for the Intervention Team..

          Tiey`look for another door.

                         ELISE
          Every door?
          tavid nods...as they walk into another...

          EXT. SHEEP MEADOW -- DAY

          Thompson and a dozen other men with hats step out into the
          rain, scan the horizon for any sign of their quarry.

          INT. CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

          The Chairman holds a silver pen as he flips through the case
          file.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 125.

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          David and Elise head towards a door across the street from
          the Banana Republic.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          They emerge through a door on the 125th Street Metro-North
          platform. Run down the stairs to street level.

          INT. BANANA REPUBLIC -- DAY

          Thompson and a half-dozen minions emerge from the same
          dressing room David and Elise did. The seventeen year-old
          attendant presses back against the wall, totally freaked now.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          David and Elise head toward a storefront church.

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          Thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing NYPD
          badges and asking questions. /

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          David and Elise enter the church and--

          EXT STONE FACADE -- DAY
          -- exit from a metal door in a stone facade. PULL BACK to
          REVEAL that they are standing at the base of the Statue of
          Liberty...
          Elise looks out at the harbor and the city. Rain pelts her
          face. And she smiles. Exhilarated. Like a prisoner who has
          just broken her chains...

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          Rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by
          Thompson and his men. A black Suburban with under-grill
          police lights pulls up fast.

          saddle up, they're moving out--

          EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY -- DAY

          Elise isstill smiling.

                         DAVID
          Let's go.

                         ELISE
          We can't keep running forever,.
          David.

                         DAVID
          If they find us ...they'll take you
          from me.

                         ELISE
          I won't let..them.

                         DAVID
          They'll take you from here.
          David touches his head'.

                         ELISE
          No, I won't let them.
          She leans,-.over and kisses hi's forehead.

          INT T. ?RE 'WAR APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
           David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.

                         DAVID
          Perfect.
          David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It's

                         ONE --
          locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise tries
          shakes her head.

                         DAVID
          They're not supposed to be locked!
          David hears sounds coming from the building's central
          staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits
          climbing up the stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 127.
          DING. The elevator door down the hall opens. More men in
          silver suits.

                         ELISE
          This one's open!
          Elise is standing at the door to the roof. David runs to her
          and they go up the stairs together to--

          EXT. ROOF -- DAY

          David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some
          concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on
          them.
          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are
          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen
          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;
          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the
          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They
          hang their legs over the edge and jump.
          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --
          except somehow they find themselves running across the same
          roof they were just on.
          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open
          from inside.
          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the
          building's edge they climb over again and... run...
          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as
          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
          roofs. They're completely surrounded.

                         ELISE
          Kiss me.
          Tears well in her eyes. And his.

                         ELISE
          Close your eyes and kiss me.
          He does. And they kiss in the rain...

                         ELISE
          I love you, David Norris.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2/12/09 128.
          They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally,
          open their eyes.. .ready to accept their fate--
          They see an empty roof. The Silver Suits are gone. And the
          rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them...
          They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing
          there, alone.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Hello, David... Good morning,
          Elise.
          His voice is gentle, paternal.

                         DAVID
          Who are you?

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          I think you know.
          David and Elise stand in awe'-'as they realize.

                         DAVID
          You can't oti{rn Fate...
          Tft , CHAIRMAN
          It's .more- complicated t,}an that,
          Fate am Free Will coexist
          They're;in tension with each other.
          And pure chance.
          A beat. David looks back at him...

                         DAVID

          TH2;.>ï¿½HAT, RMAN
          I could control 'everything. You'd
          be ha` 3 ou' d be puppets. I
          try to .keep things from getting too
          out of control. But that has a
          cost. Most people go through life
          like pinballs, reacting predictably
          to the stimuli I apply. They
          accept the path they find
          themselves on. And perform
          accordingly. But every once in a
          while someone comes along who
          refuses to be bound by his fate,
          someone who understands that Free
          Will is a gift most people are too
          afraid to use.

                         (BEAT)
          Which, you see, is partly the point
          of all this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           2/12/09 129.
          THE CHAIRMAN (cont'd)
          Or maybe you don't see it. Maybe
          you just feel it. And that's even
          better. Because that's the other
          part.
          David and Elise take it in...

                         DAVID
          And all the misery, all the pain...

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          I sit up there and I watch it and
          it hurts me... . but if you could see
          the incredible courage people show,
          the random acts of kindness, the
          love... If you could see huitan
          beings choosing every moment
          every day to be better thAn'' I made
          them, you would know it's all
          worthwhile.

                         (BEAT)
          Good luck, David. And good luck to
          you, Elise. You're a-beautiful
          dancer. And so much more...
          The Chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Their case isclosed.

          AIDE TO THE CHAIRRMAN
          But, Sir,isn't this a majtr.
          deviation from The Plan?
          The Chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio
          open and signs- a document on -ery heavy paper.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Not anymc3e .
          David and Elise watc]i The Chairman walk away, still awed by
          what=they've just experienced. As He disappears around a
          corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ...
          After a long beat, Elise turns back to David, as if to say
          "what do we do now?"

                         DAVID
          Maybe we should go dancing.
          A smile slowly spreads across her face ...

		Re:  Project Sawtooth

FADE IN:

EXT.  SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY	1

Beside a 1950 Ford, a quartet of elite intellectuals poses 
playfully...dressed in the local custom of boots and cowboy hats, the 
TOW ORIENTAL MEN, A CAUCASIAN MAN, AND A CAUCASIAN WOMAN squint into 
the hot sun and then down at the jiggling home movie camera, the 
operator lopsided...

NARRATOR
The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase 
of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms.  Stung by this Soviet 
challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated 
weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi 
Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the 
dismal record of failure that has dogged the project.

TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from 
its present operator, a four-year-old child...A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND 
COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian 
woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him...

NARRATOR
Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares 
himself anxious to work for the Allies.  Enamored of the great American 
West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child "Buckaroo."  
A tribute to his adopted homeland.

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	2

A strange TWO-MAN SPEED VEHICLE readies for takeoff...the FIRST "PILOT" 
in the cockpit Dr. Banzai himself:

NARRATOR
And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory 
disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School 
of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to 
gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass 
unharmed through solid matter.

The SECOND "PILOT," a fair-haired Caucasian:	3

NARRATOR
Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy, affable limey, co-developer 
with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced 
theoretical gravity catapult...

	4
The fourth scientist, the female Caucasian, busy with last-minute 
details, securing the two pilots in their seats, checking their 
instrument data, writing on a clipboard...

NARRATOR
Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in Negative Mass Propulsion 
...wife of Dr. Masado Banzai.

...as the four-year-old BUCKAROO BANZAI now approaches the speed 
machine and gives his father a good-bye kiss...Dr. Banzai saying 
something to the boy, Buckaroo bowing respectfully, as his father and 
mother exchange last-minute assurances...

The cockpit canopy comes down, and Sandra Banzai tugs a reluctant 
little Buckaroo toward a sandbagged shelter...

EXT.  SANDBAGS - DAY	5

...where Professor Hikita sits at a bank of monitoring equipment, 
Sandra Banzai and Buckaroo entering the enclosure as...

...A SUDDEN NOISE causes Sandra Banzai to turn in fear, the bizarre 
speed machine's motors whining at an astonishing rpm, BLINDING GREEN 
FLAMES ENGULFING ITS COCKPIT...

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	6

...Sandra Banzai rushing toward the sheet-metal vehicle through SMOKE 
AND GREEN FLAME as her husband and Sir Alan both struggle to get out...

	7
...Buckaroo running after his mother who attempts to help the 
scientists free themselves when suddenly the child is thrown to the 
ground and protected by Professor Hikita's own body...as the 
experimental car VAPORIZES IN A FLASH OF EMERALD GREEN LIGHT!  THE 
SCREEN GOING WHITE, A LAUNCH COUNTDOWN BEGINNING UNDER A SOMBER CARD:

...one such observer, GENERAL CATBURD, an AIDE approaching, whispering 
unpleasant news in his ear...

GENERAL CATBURD
You're kidding. Where is he?  Still in the hospital? 

The aide shrugging, the General leaning over to a nervous man sitting 
next to him...SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY.

GENERAL CATBURD
Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr. Secretary. Looks like he's got cold feet.

Another angle.  Two of Buckaroo's men, RENO and PERFECT TOMMY, sitting 
with their boots on a computer console.

PERFECT TOMMY
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.

RENO
Why me?

...an attractive NETWORK TV ANCHORWOMAN headed this way...

PERFECT TOMMY
'Cause I'm busy.  And get your clodhoppers off the UNIVAC.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	13

THE EYES OF DOCTOR BUCKAROO BANZAI, THE REST OF HIS FACE HIDDEN BY A 
SURGICAL MASK...such concentration.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	14

...a phone ringing, a NURSE answering it, then:

NURSE
Rawhide, it's for you.

Jacketless, A SINISTER PISTOL visible in the tooled leather shoulder 
holster, RAWHIDE takes the receiver.

RAWHIDE
I'll ask him.
(into his Go-Fone)
Buckaroo, I need an estimate.  They're getting antsy over at Mission 
Control.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	15

Buckaroo Banzai speaks into his GO-FONE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another ten minutes down here, Rawhide.

REVEALING DOCTOR BANZAI, the great surgeon, surrounded by a well-oiled 
team of physicians and nurses...his steady, miraculously skilled hands 
working a LASER KNIFE on the brain of a PATIENT sitting clamped in a 
serious chair.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	16

RAWHIDE
(into phone)
The chief needs ten more minutes.  I got the chopper waiting.  Don't 
start without us.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	17

Perfect Tommy still leaning back in his swivel chair, smiling at the 
blonde TV anchorwoman, waiting for her CAMERAMAN to set up...

TV ANCHORWOMAN
So where's Buckaroo?

PERFECT TOMMY
(a wry smile)
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?

The anchorwoman catching his drift, smiling, knowing Perfect Tommy 
perhaps intimately...Perfect Tommy glancing across the crowded room at 
Reno raising ten fingers...

PERFECT TOMMY
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you 
doing tonight?

TV ANCHORWOMAN
(picking up his hat)
Flying to Cambodia.

Perfect Tommy frowning severely as she tried on his Stetson, the 
anchorwoman promptly getting the message and putting it back down.

PERFECT TOMMY
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I 
hadda kill you.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Bet I do.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	18

Another STAR SURGEON, scrubbing for an operation next door now peeking 
at his wrist watch TV:

CLOSE ON THE TINY TV:  AN IMAGE OF THE JET CAR...	19

ANGLE ON...	20

STAR SURGEON
Jesus Christ...how does the man find enough hours in the day?

RAWHIDE
We help.

The surgeon curious, studying the big TV monitor, Rawhide sensing an 
explanation is in order:

RAWHIDE
Dr. Banzai's using a laser to fuse artificial nerve fiber to the 
original, bypassing massive stroke damage.  A subcutaneous microphone's 
gonna allow the patient to transmit verbal instructions to his own 
brain.

STAR SURGEON
What, like "raise my left arm"?

RAWHIDE
Or "throw the harpoon," depending on cultural differences. People are 
gonna come from all over. This guy's an Eskimo.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	21

Buckaroo winding down the surgery.  A BRILLIANT BUT ERRATIC JEWISH 
PHYSICIAN at his side whispering through a mask...

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Okay...right...okay, I see...next time I'll be able to...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There may not be a next time.

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Look...I'm sorry...calling for help in the middle of an operation...but 
I just lost my nerve...I panicked...again.

Buckaroo picking a NIKON up off a table, snapping some pictures of his 
handiwork...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You've got the God-given tools to be a success in any field of 
endeavor, Dr. Zwibel.  Ever thought about joining me full-time?

JEWISH PHYSICIAN (DR. ZWIBEL)
Are you serious?  Have you have an opening?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can you sing?

DR. ZWIBEL
A little. I can dance.

Buckaroo glancing at the clock on the wall...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	22

PROF. HIKITA
Inertial Control positive.  T minus seven zero and resume counting.

MISSION CONTROL
All systems righteous.  Professor Hikita says we have to go.

General Catburd and other VIPS happy to observe on their TV monitors 
the sight of a MAN IN BLACK COMMANDO PARACHUTE SUIT, carrying a 
BATTERED OLD BRIEFCASE, climbing into the cockpit of...THE JET CAR.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY

THE DRIVER'S POV, a curious combination of airplane dials and switches 
and personal touches like a big four-on-the-floor gear shift and a 
snazzy pearlized Brodi knob with snowflakes and a coochi-coochi girl...

ANGLE ON the driver as he removes a strange GRYOSCOPIC DEVICE from his 
briefcase, plugs it into a cradle near his head...

I've got a budget meeting on the hill, John.  What's this thing 
supposed to do anyway?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Three hundred miles an hour, General.

GENERAL CATBURD
Senator, you are so fulla shit.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

The Jet Car undergoing an amazing transformation:  TWO STABILIZER FINS 
AND A JET ENGINE suddenly appearing on its rear deck...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	29

CLOSE ON THE DRIVER TO REVEAL BUCKAROO BANZAI, world famous figure in 
every field of endeavor as he withdraws a beautiful KAMIKAZE SCARF from 
his flight suit...wraps it like a warrior's headband around his 
helmet...

	30
ANGLE ON Buckaroo's hand as his fingers flip a row of toggle switches, 
THE PULSATING POWER OF THE JET ENGINE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY with each 
successive switch...the vehicle a caged beast, taunting us, as Buckaroo 
flips the last switch...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Final contact is made.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	31

No kidding.  A TWENTY FOOT SHEET OF FIRE ROCKETING FROM THE BACK OF THE 
JET CAR...THEN ANOTHER...THEN ANOTHER...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	32

The Cavaliers at their monitors, calm...Hikita making minor adjustments

both now at viewing slots in the blockhouse wall...

PROF. HIKITA
Point of no return...five, four, three, two...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	33

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE

As Buckaroo Banzai twists his steering-wheel mounted TWIN ACCELERATORS, 
the sudden forward lurch of the Jet Car slamming him back against the 
headrest...

ANGLE ON	37

GENERAL CATBURD
Too bad war ain't Indianapolis.  It's fast, I'll give Banzai that.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Perhaps an idea whose time has come, General?  Scoot over.

Catburd moving aside as Senator Cunningham takes her turn with the 
viewing device.

GENERAL CATBURD
It'll never work.  It's too simple.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo 
able to keep that thing on the ground?

PERFECT TOMMY
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	42

Talk about a road hugger...the JET CAR SCREAMS PAST A BANK OF HIGH 
SPEED CAMERAS...THE EARTH SHAKING...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	43

PROF. HIKITA
Approaching thirty seconds downrange Three zero.  Course steady.  Speed

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	49

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's a big "no can do".

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE- DAY	50

Buckaroo's voice through STATIC AND CRACKLE.  Professor Hikita white-
knuckled...determined.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	51

Buckaroo STILL ACCELERATING, struggling with his mighty

wipes hot oil off his goggles...

INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY	52

In the NETWORK HELICOPTER, a NEWSMAN and CAMERMAN catch this shocking 
turn of events:

BOOM!

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	54

A TV MONITOR...A HELICOPTER SHOT revealing that the course thus far 
traveled by Buckaroo is ON FIRE, the ground literally set ablaze by the 
incredible speed of his JET CAR:

ANGLE ON:	55

TV ANCHORWOMAN
The Jet Car off the road!  Radio contact with Mission Control here 
severed...that firestorm apparently interfering with 
communications...Buckaroo Banzai in serious trouble.

GENERAL CATBURD
Either that or he's popped his cookies.

Professor Hikita, on pins and needles, face taught, concerned.

MISSION CONTROL
Mach 1.  Buckaroo!  Do you read?  Commence braking procedure!  Over!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
He's heading for the goddamn mountains!

MISSION CONTROL
Eject, Buckaroo! EJECT!

Buckaroo heard faintly in a STORM OF NOISE...SPEAKING JAPANESE...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Professor Hikita, what'd he say?

PROF. HIKITA
(quizzical)
He said, "This Bud's for you, Professor."  What does that mean?

	56
ON THE MONITORS the JET CAR is seen heading directly into a box canyon 
and TOWARD A WALL OF MOUNTAINS, impact virtually assured.

ANGLE ON:	57

GENERAL CATBURD
Looks like Banzai's finally gonna get more than he bargained for.  And 
take the friends of the Earth with him.

Rawhide and Reno exchanging very concerned glances...

GENERAL CATBURD
What the devil?  What is going on?!

BUCKAROO'S COCKPIT POV... like a roller coaster ride through a meteor 
shower - THE EIGHTH DIMENSION, AN ORGANIC ASTEROID HURTLING RIGHT AT US 
EMITTING STRANGE STATIC ELECTRICAL CHARGES...MONSTROUS...RED...GHASTLY!

	68
REVERSE ANGLE.  Looking directly at Buckaroo as his face distorts under 
God-knows-how-many G-forces...where the hell is he?!  His plexiglas 
visor shattering as if hit with a two-by-four.

his Brodi knob hard to the right!

EXT.  MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY	79

Buckaroo doing the impossible, somehow bringing the racing JET CAR to a 
spinning, skidding halt in a thicket of dry brush!  AS OVERHEAD THAT 
NETWORK HELICOPTER CIRCLES...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	80

The battered JET CAR, exhausting smoke, Buckaroo rolling its window 
down, opening the door and emerging, checking the damage to his 
vehicle, noting a STRANGE GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE on the cracked 
windshield, touching it and turning his nose from the smell...his glove 
steaming!

THE NEWS COPTER LANDING IN THE DISTANCE.	81

	82
ANGLE ON Buckaroo as he lowers himself under the Jet Car, coming face-
to-face with one ugly SPHERICAL PARASITE, THE THING SUDDENLY SHOOTING 
OUT at Buckaroo as he's about to touch it...A MOBILE PHONE starting to 
BEEP back in the cockpit...the PARASITE coming to rest on the 
ground...dead?

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	83

Pandemonium, people cheering...General Catburd on the phone...

GENERAL CATBURD
This his frequency?  Nobody's home.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	84

Buckaroo ignoring the phone, taking his lunch bag from the front seat 
and removing a sandwich, taking a bite of it, and using the foil to 
pick up the BIZARRE PARASITE from the desert floor...wrapping the weird 
thing up...now at last reaching for the car phone...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	85

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(Taking the phone)
Gimme that!  You tell me, Buckaroo, what in the hell is this going-
through-solid-matter-and rendering-all-conventional-defense-perimeters-
useless-over-night bullshit?

But now Professor Hikita snatching the phone from the Secretary, 
turning his back to the room!

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  Did you seem them?  Did you?

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	86

Buckaroo leaning in to check his gauges, talking on his telephone.  TWO 
FIGURES from the news copter approaching, still a hundred yards off...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast.  
Broke my windshield...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	87

PROF. HIKITA
(into phone)
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?

GENERAL CATBURD
Creatures?
(grabbing the phone)
Buckaroo, Catburd here.  I got egg all over my face, but that's okay.  
No room for egos here.  We're all Americans and I wanna buy that thing 
of yours.  What's it gonna run me?

PROF. HIKITA
Not for sale.

GENERAL CATBURD
I wasn't talking to you, Hikita san.

...as the Secretary of Defense picks up a RED PHONE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
This'll be the President of me?

Perfect Tommy and Reno suddenly stepping forward, intimidating 
Catburd...

PERFECT TOMMY
She's not for sale, right, General?

INT.  HOME FOR CRIMINALLY INSANCE - DAY	88

CLOSE ON the haunting, unsettling eyes of DOCTOR LIZARDO, AN ORANGE-
HAIRED OLD MAN watching NETWORK FOOTAGE of the Jet Car Test on his 
battered Philco TV set...his eyes practically burning a whole through 
the screen...

...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a room in an insane asylum, a room designed 
for several inmates but occupied by only one, this crazy old 
fiend...the empty beds piled with books and Italian memorabilia, the 
walls covered with mathematical equations...

	89
ANGLE ON Dr. Lizardo even now unable to resist scribbling another 
formula on the wall with a piece of chalk...

CLOSE ON PHILCO:	90

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Here she is, slowed down.  Lookit there...slam!  Right into the side of 
that mountain!  Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno, you guys're the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers. Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.  So I gotta ask, did 
it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the BJV, the 
experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently smack 
into a black void?

PERFECT TOMMY ON TV
Nope.

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Was Buckaroo acting different this morning, I mean, in terms of other 
mornings?

The Cavaliers rolling their eyes, looking at one another...

RAWHIDE ON TV
Well, we partied pretty late last night.

	91
BACK TO Dr. Lizardo now hearing footsteps outside in the corridor, and 
HIS LEFT AHND, ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS RIGHT, ERASES THE EQUATION 
HE'S JUST WRITTEN...as his right hand reaches under his pillow and 
picks up a crude HOMEMADE ELECTROMAGNET...a piece of metal wrapped in 
copper wire, one end of which is a small loop that Lizardo now attaches 
directly to his thumbs...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(muttering)
The Overthruster! The Overthruster! 

Lizardo looking back at his equation, at first puzzled to find it 
erased, then becoming angry.

	92
CLOSE ON HIS HAND NOW STICKING THE OTHER END OF HIS HOME-MADE DEVICE 
DIRECTLY INTO AN ELECTIRCAL SOCKET...

ANGLE ON:	93

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(obsessed)
The Overthruster! 

ELECTRICAL CURRENT COURSING THROUGH LIZARDO'S BODY...AN AURA 
SURROUNDING HIM AS HIS LIPS CURL INTO A HIDEOUS SMILE...BURNING THE 
SCREEN, TAKING US INTO AN ASTOUNDING FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:

INT.  STRANGE LABORATORY - NIGHT	94

Forty-six years prior (years before the ill-fated primitive speed car 
run involving Buckaroo's parents) an unlikely experiment in a strange 
factory...A RUNWAY...a much younger, dark-haired Doctor Lizardo being 
strapped into a homemade wicker chair/rocket sled by two LAB 
ASSISTANTS, the entire contraption set up like a catapult AIMED 
DIRECTLY AT A LOSID BRICK WALL, THROBBING ELECTROMAGNETS AND BANKS OF 
GLOWING OSCILLATORS...

	95
ANOTHER ANGLE...and peering into an unusual periscope, an equally 
JUVENILE PROFESSOR HIKITA wearing glasses and scraggly 
goatee...standing in front of a 1938 calendar on the wall, today's 
eagerly awaited date circled in red...

PROF. HIKITA
Almost ready, Dr. Lizardo...almost...

Doctor Lizardo pulling on a leather helmet, Professor Hikita nodding 
grimly at the LAB ASSISTANTS who tug on a GIANT LEVER...the 
ELECTROMAGNETS PULSATING...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
More!  More!

PROF. HIKITA
Not so fast...

	96
ANGLE ON Doctor Lizardo pulling a switch, UNLEASHING HIS WICKER CHAIR 
AT A FANTASTIC SPEED down the rails!

	97
AT THE END OF THE TRACK...the strange device coming to an abrupt and 
total stop ten feet from the brick wall, pitching Lizardo forward 
and...

	98
...through the wall, at least partially, the seemingly solid bricks 
turning out to be more like vertical QUICKSAND...Lizardo half in, half 
out, physically unhurt but screaming his head off...

	99
...the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose, while 
Professor Hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope.

	100
PERISCOPE POV:  HUGE GROTESQUE RED CREATURES IN AN AURA OF ELECTRICITY 
TRYING TO PULL DOCTOR LIZARDO TOWARD THEM...ONE CREATURE IN PARTICULAR 
ENVELOPING LIZARDO!

	101
BACK TO...the doctor's assistants frantically tugging on his feet, 
dragging him back into the room only to find this SUDDENLY ORANGE-
HAIRED LIZARDO a fearsome, changed individual...a beast!

	102
CLOSE ON LIZARDO!  A terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he 
straightens up, at last wrenching free of the wicker chair, smashing 
his two assistants' heads together as he jumps over the runway!  Hikita 
watching wild-eyed as Lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy 
expanse of the factory...

	103
A DISTANT VIEW OF LIZARDO as he rips a door off its hinges, escaping 
into the night, SILHOUTTED AGAINST A DAZZLING SECURITY LIGHT, THE 
SCREEN BURNING WHITE...OUR FLASHBACK ENDING.

INT.  LIZARDO'S ROOM - NIGHT	104

Nearly half a century later, the elderly Lizardo regards with 
smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance 
of a GUARD who comes in and unplugs his TV set.

GUARD
Cheer up, Lizardo, it's Friday.  I come for your TV.  You been using 
too damn much juice...ten thousand kilowatts again this month.  Beats 
me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power.

The guard leaving with Lizardo's TV...Lizardo trying to control 
himself, his eyes rolling up at the ceiling where yet another UNUSUAL 
EQUATION has been scrawled in an angry hand.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
I want my TV...don't take my TV...I want it.  I want the Overthruster.  
I want it.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT	105

Mysterious half-light...CLOSEUPS...plugs and jacks...a portion of an 
upright base...drums with the BANZAI LOGO writ large...hands and feet 
putting everything together as an unseen audience stirs restlessly...

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT	106

Backstage in a small dressing room, the rock band known as the Hong 
Kong Cavaliers waits to go on...three unidentified GROUPIES in 
attendance as Rawhide naps and Reno tunes his saxophone while Perfect 
Tommy answers the questions of a FEMALE REPORTER from the local 
underground press...

Professor Hikita meantime at a corner table, studying his big notebook, 
examining a pair of KODAK SLIDES...

...as there is the sound of a commotion in the corridor, EXCITED VOICES 
and FOOT TRAFFIC coming this way, Rawhide methodically counting down 
under his Stetson:

RAWHIDE
Five...four...three...two...one.

	107
The door to the dressing room opening precisely on the count of one, 
admitting an out-of-breath and hastily tuxedoed Buckaroo Banzai, A 
SMALL CROWD OF ASSORTED FEMAL FANS locked outside.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm starving...somebody, help.

RAWHIDE
Got a half a tuna sandwich.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Same one you had yesterday?

Rawhide taking a half-eaten sandwich out of his hat and tossing it to 
Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Smells fermented.
(taking a big bite)
Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen 
you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.

RENO
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that 
crack in her windshield.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?

PERFECT TOMMY
Coming right up, Buckaroo.

Perfect Tommy producing a highly sophisticated SLIDE VIEWER...Buckaroo 
slipping in a transparency.

	108
HIS POV OF A COLORFUL PRISMATIC GRAPH over the backdrop of A NAKED 
WOMAN.

	109
Buckaroo immediately diagnosing the problem and removing the naked-
woman slide from the viewer...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Anybody we know?

PERFECT TOMMY
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?

Rawhide reclaiming his raunchy slide, Buckaroo looking back into the 
sleek device...

PROF. HIKITA
I ran it through the centrifuge, but I came up blank.  It's definitely 
dead now, although it still conducts electricity even better than 
copper does.

PERFECT TOMMY
Super performance organic material.

PROF. HIKITA
Yes, Perfect Tommy, in a way.  However...
(slipping in another slide)
...notice...although certain components resist identification, it 
corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(scrutinizing)
Too closely.  Gotta be more than sheer coincidence.  Rawhide, you're 
keen on bugs.  What do you think?

Rawhide takes a look as Reno hangs the phone up...

RENO
Everything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo.  Sam's with the Jet 
Car and she's under lock and key.  He's retiming her valves.

Buckaroo nodding, as he's interrupted by Perfect Tommy who's now 
brought over the female reporter...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not really.  This is pretty important.

PERFECT TOMMY
She wants a picture.

Perfect Tommy quickly taking a place beside Buckaroo, smiling into the 
camera, as Reno and Rawhide exchange disgusted looks...

	110
...the shutter clicking...another commotion in the hallway...the 
dressing room door opening to admit the club owner, ARTIE DUNCAN, a 
fifty-year-old rocker who has to struggle to close the door behind him 
on a herd of REPORTERS and FANS...

ARTIE DUNCAN
I don't care who you are...when you play my joint, you're just another 
band. I want some music outta you characters.

RENO 
You want it, Artie? You got it.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?

PERFECT TOMMY
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.

A pair of no-nonsense BLUE SHIELD IRREGULARS appearing to escort them 
on-stage...as Rawhide returns the spectroscope to Professor Hikita...

RAWHIDE
No question about it.  Something very akin to arachnoid tissue.  If I 
hadda guess?  A mutated species.

INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT	111

Buckaroo, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, and their two Blue Shield escorts 
hustling down a corridor.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB STAGE - NIGHT	112

Our boys arriving on stage...SHADOWY FORMS in the dramatically murky 
light...a FAMILIAR VOICE BOOMING OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM...

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery is proud to present, for one night 
only...the one, the only, the amazing Buckaroo Banzai and his Hong Kong 
Cavaliers!

LIGHTS UP!  AND A WAVE OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ROCK 'N' ROLL CRASHES OUT 
ON THE AUDIENCE, Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won't sit still!

	113
...while at the rear of the room, seated by herself, we find an 
ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY...crying, for some reason exempt from the general 
raucous good will.  She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do 
the job.  She's all alone.  She needs some help.  Her name is PENNY 
PRIDDY.

	114
On-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves 
the Cavaliers to cease as well.  EERIE STILLNESS, the only sound 
Buckaroo's lips on the silver mike.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I heard somebody crying.
(no response)
I said is someone out there crying in the darkness?

Yes, indeed...Penny's voice, weakly:	115

PENNY PRIDDY
Here...here at the back. I'm sorry...

	116
Buckaroo squints, spots her.  His voice comes mighty over the PUBLIC 
ADDRESS SYSTEM.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Raise your hand...where?

PENNY PRIDDY
(raising her hand)
This is so embarrassing...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's 
your name?

PENNY PRIDDY
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

For reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to 
Buckaroo and the Cavaliers as "Peggy," said name immediately eliciting 
a surprised reaction from the Cavaliers...

...Buckaroo amazed as well...a not-too-distant pain deep in his soul 
momentarily manifesting itself, although he makes a brave attempt at 
nonchalance...as now Penny is given that microphone.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you say..."Peggy"?

PENNY PRIDDY
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean 
anything to you.  I'm a nobody.

The business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing 
a bit more easily...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?

PENNY PRIDDY
(blowing her nose)
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 
69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my 
luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record 
producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for 
life, and like a fool, well, I...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
He offered you money?

PENNY PRIDDY
Do I look like that kinda girl?
(to tell the truth)
I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep 
tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still 
got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, 
I'll always have a job.

A few snickers...BUCKAROO shooting a disapproving look at those guilty 
of laughing at another person's misfortune...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Remember it's always darkest just before the dawn.  Believe me, I've 
been there.

Buckaroo moving to a piano...starting to play...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on 
your luck.

PENNY PRIDDY
(exasperated)
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?

	117
Buckaroo and his men start to SING ANOTHER TUNE...slower, sexier.

	118
...and Penny opens HER BIG CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE, removes first a dog-
earned paperback entitled Beyond the Realm of Atomic Particles and 
Massless Photons, by Buckaroo Banzai...then a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC 
BOOK, its cover depicting Buckaroo locked in mortal combat with HANOI 
SHAN, THE MANCHU TERROR!  Penny lays both publications on the table, 
continues to dig around, revealing next a SHINY SMALL-CALIBER AUTOMATIC 
PISTOL...

	119
ON STAGE...as Buckaroo pours it on, looking in her direction...	

	120
Penny takes the gun from her purse and lays it in her lap, tears 
starting to flood her eyes...

	121
BUCKAROO CROONING, all the women enraptured by his voice, his sultry 
glance, his animal presence...a real heart-breaker.

	122
Penny takes another drink, wraps her hand around the tiny pearl 
handle...SLOWLY MOVING THE GUN...

	123
ON STAGE, Buckaroo startled...	

	124
...as in the blink of an eye Penny ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT HERSELF, her arm 
accidentally deflected by a passing WAITRESS, the SHOT going harmlessly 
into the ceiling as...

	125
...the crack Hong Kong Cavaliers whip out their GUNS, snapping back 
hammers, forming a human barricade around Buckaroo...

	126
...while BLUE SHIELD SECURITY MEN materialize and drag Penny screaming 
from the room.

PENNY PRIDDY
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody okay up here?

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Arrest the girl!  Let's get this thing on the road, huh?

	127
The Cavaliers holstering their weapons, resuming musical 
postures...Buckaroo too...but his mind still half on Penny Priddy.

INT.  CRIMINALLY INSANCE COORIDOR - NIGHT	128

Recreation time.  SEVERAL MADMEN playing video games, content.

Doctor Lizardo's Philco TV now sitting on a watch desk, the guard who 
took it eating dinner, leaning back in his chair, his feet on the 
set...so he can bash it now and then to improve the picture 
quality...as a SHADOW falls across him...Doctor Lizardo...pulling a 
RATTY SUITCASE on tiny travel wheels, wearing an ANCIENT SPORTJACKET.  
Out for a stroll?

GUARD
Where do you think you're going, doc? The moon?

	129
An amazing thing occurring, as Lizardo's right arm rockets out an 
catches the astonished guard around the throat, lifting him off the 
floor, Lizardo's left hand picking up the telephone...

DR. LIZARDO
Operator! I wanna place a person-to-person call to John Bigboote, 
Yoyodyne Propulsions Systems.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Tell him it's 
John Whorfin calling. That's W-H-O-R-F-I-N. Got it, honey? John! J-O-H-
N!

Lizardo waiting for the call to go through as he strangles the last 
breath of air out of the helpless guard, drops him to the linoleum, 
reaching for the dead man's keys...

DR. LIZARDO
(into phone)
Of course it's me, John Bigboote, you fool! Prepare for my return!  The 
time has come.  Haven't you heard? Don't you watch TV? Banzai and 
Hikita have done it! I'll meet you at the factory.  Get that 
overthruster!  And the little Jap!  Alive!  Banzai's too dangerous.

Lizardo ripping the phone out of the wall, hurling it across the 
room...

...those inmates playing their video games fleeing like rabbits when 
they see that...Lizardo obviously no ordinary lunatic, as he proves by 
simply reaching out and...

	130
...touching THE BUCKAROO BANZAI VIDEO GAME, instantly shorting it out 
on his way to freedom, suitcase in tow.

INT.  BEDROOM ON BUS - DAY	131

CLOSE ON a newspaper, a banner front page headline announcing the 
amazing Jet Car test...

...and down in a lower corner, A PHOTOGRAPH OF "WOULD-BE-ASSASSIN" 
PENNY PRIDDY being summarily escorted out of Artie's Artery...PULLING 
BACK TO REVEAL...

	132
...a simple steel frame bed, fold-out desk with microscope, scientific 
books everywhere...Buckaroo trying to tie his bowtie, glancing at the 
newspaper propped upon his dresser, that picture of Penny Priddy 
staring back at him...Perfect Tommy and Reno nearby assembling some 
kind of slide show...THE WHOLE ROOM SWAYING MYSTERIOUSLY...

...the two Cavaliers worrying more about Buckaroo than about what 
they're doing, as they fumble the slides, several falling to the 
floor...

PERFECT TOMMY
Pick those up, Reno.

RENO
I didn't drop 'em.

...Perfect Tommy getting up and peeking at the newspaper over 
Buckaroo's shoulder...then returning to Reno...their voices low...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's a spittin' image.

RENO 
Doesn't look anything like her to me.

PERFECT TOMMY
Pictures don't lie.

RENO 
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks 
so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, 
right?

	133
Buckaroo overhearing all of this, of course, as the door opens, Rawhide 
appearing, offering a COMPUTER PRINT-OUT...

RAWHIDE
Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo. Thought you'd wanna be 
notified. That old pal of the professor's, Dr. Emilio Lizardo?  The one 
you did the brain scan on--?  He killed a guard last night, broke outta 
the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled 
it a block away.

Buckaroo's expression changing at the mention of the name 
Lizardo...taking the 
print-out.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Then what?

RAWHIDE
Vanished. Thin air.

PERFECT TOMMY
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?

RENO
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.

RAWHIDE
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath 
with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy 
brown like yours.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Have you warned Professor Hikita?

RAWHIDE
First thing I did.

PERFECT TOMMY
(in the dark)
Why?  What's going on?  Anything I oughta know?  C'mon, Rawhide, spill 
it.

Buckaroo nodding his permission...

RAWHIDE
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to 
discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before 
Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a 
rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half 
out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was 
orange...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.

RAWHIDE
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, 
got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away 
the key.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

Buckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his 
pocket.

RAWHIDE
And another thing.  Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without 
signing.

Buckaroo and Reno automatically turning to Perfect Tommy...

PERFECT TOMMY
Wasn't me.  I'd take a hundred, right?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	134

...the guys following Buckaroo into an amazing ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, 
like the rugged interior of an AWACS, dimly lighted instrument panels 
manned by two BLUE SHIELD TECHNICAL EXPERTS.

RADAR SHEILD ONE
Lookit this, Buckaroo.  Grossly abnormal high-altitude electrostatic 
disturbance over Connecticut.  Fallout from the Jet Car, you think?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Doubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.  Work 
her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then 
shovel the data over to Reno.

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - DAY	135

Buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door, and for the first 
time we realize that we just might be on a MOVING BUS...

EXT.  POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY	136

BUCKAROO'S BUS pulling up...BUCKAROO BANZAI AND THE HONG KONG CAVALIERS 
emblazoned along its side.

INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY	137

Waiting near the watch desk, Buckaroo's Jewish surgeon buddy, Dr. 
Zwibel...in a thousand-dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear, a 
Hoppalong Cassidy hat, red alligator boots, listening to the local 
COUNTRY STATION on a suitcase size stereo...

...looking up as Buckaroo, Reno, and Perfect Tommy approach...

DR. ZWIBEL
Howdy, Buckaroo.  Got your message about rendezvousing here.  Barely 
had time to pack my saddlebags.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Sid, welcome aboard.
(shaking hands)
Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel.  He'll be riding with us 
from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around.

Buckaroo heading over to the DESK SERGEANT on duty...

RENO
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Where do you hail from, Doc?

DR. ZWIBEL
(catching on)
New Jersey!

RENO NEVADA
Where's your spurs at?

DR. ZWIBEL
You making fun of me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus 
and introduce him to the rest of the hands.

RENO
Why me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.

Reno picking up Doctor Zwibel's huge stereo and suitcase...

RENO
Follow me, pard'ner.

INT.  CELL - DAY	138

Penny sitting on her bunk, a disheveled mess...depressed, her head 
buried in her hands as Buckaroo arrives.  She sees his reflection in 
the pitiful mirror above her toilet...

PENNY PRIDDY
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before 
any of this craziness.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go away.  Let me rot?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who were you really trying to kill last night?

PENNY PRIDDY
You.  Like the papers all say.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pretty terrible shot.

Silence.  Penny realizing you don't fool this man with the sloppy 
bowtie...coming over to the bars...

PENNY PRIDDY
Was she pretty?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who?

PENNY PRIDDY
The girl I remind you of.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.

PENNY PRIDDY
It's kinda hard this way.

Meaning fixing his tie...which she's trying to do...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.

PENNY PRIDDY
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?

PENNY PRIDDY
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, 
right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, I don't.

Penny taking too long to retie Buckaroo's tie...an excuse to be near 
him...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?

PENNY PRIDDY
Which?  The one in my throat.

Things really heating up between these two...Buckaroo changing the 
subject...blocking Perfect Tommy's view.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?

PENNY PRIDDY
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another 'you'?

PENNY PRIDDY
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I 
was adopted.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit 
me!

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with 
what you have...

Buckaroo touching her moist cheek, wiping away a tear.  Perfect Tommy 
and the Desk Sergeant exchanging looks...

PERFECT TOMMY
Running a little late, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let her out. In my custody.

PERFECT TOMMY
Let her out?  She's a killer.

Buckaroo and Penny unable to look away from each other.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No she's not. 

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON	139

REPORTERS, cameras, microphones, and a small audience of VIPS, civilian 
and military, in a large hotel conference room...eyes on the ticking 
clock...examining charts and MODELS OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES...on the 
dais, Professor Hikita, Secretary of Defense McKinley and Senator 
Cunningham, waiting for Buckaroo.

	140
Over the refreshment table set up for reporters, TWO REDHEADED MEN 
WEARING GLASSES practically FILL THEIR CUPS WITH CUBES OF SUGAR...one 
of their arms ELONGATING (1) for more sugar...THE STRANGE MOVE 
UNNOTICED...

	141
...as the crowd breaks into SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE and Buckaroo Banzai 
enter, Penny Priddy beside him...the glamorous couple surrounded by the 
Hong Kong Cavaliers.

	142
JOHN O'CONNOR, and JOHN GOMEZ, those two nearsighted REDHEADS with the 
sweet coffee applauding only politely.

	143
Buckaroo taking Penny onto the dais with him, the Cavaliers assuming 
positions of security as...

...Buckaroo sits next to Professor Hikita who shields his remarks from 
what must be easily FIFTY MICROPHONES...

PROF. HIKITA
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(nodding)
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, 
just in case.

Professor Hikita removing the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER from his 
battered briefcase and laying it on the table.  Buckaroo taking a sip 
of water...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Thank you for coming.  Before I answer any questions, I think Buckaroo 
owes us all a few explanations for yesterday's antics.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years 
ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all 
former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of 
Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane 
notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another 
planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid 
matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually 
glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with 
Doctor Emilio Lizardo.

1st REPORTER
The same Doctor Lizardo that just...?

PROF. HIKITA
One and the same.

	144
SOMEONE ELSE'S NEARSIGHTED POV, PEERING AT THE BACK OF PROFESSOR 
HIKITA'S HEAD THROUGH A CRACK IN THE CURTAINS BEHIND THE DAIS...

	145
John O'Connor and John Gomez at the refreshment table now adding 
several packs of 'Sweet 'n' Low' to their thick coffee as...

ON THE DAIS:	146

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm 
talking twister physics.  Quantum Mechanics.  Now you see, now you 
don't.  This table I'm sitting behind?  It appears to be solid matter, 
right?

Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping 
it, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces 
off the table...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons, 
quarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one 
quadrillionth of its total volume.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Exactly.  So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if 
solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover 
a to travel inside things like tables.  And mountains.

PROF. HIKITA
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating 
gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its 
electroweak forces!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, 
professor?

2nd REPORTER
What about the Pentagon?  The possibility of war in the Eighth 
Dimension, Mr. Secretary?

PENNY PRIDDY
Hey, better there than here, huh?

SOME APPLAUSE, the Secretary of Defense eyeing Penny critically as the 
lights dim...as RADAR SHIELD ONE slips into the room, approaches the 
dais, and the FIRST SLIDE is projected onto the screen...

	147
...the image a murky one...but the outline of a WARSHIP WITH U.S. 
SAILORS ABOARD nonetheless unmistakable...

CLOSE ON:	148

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(a whisper)
The President's calling you, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The president of what?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
The President of the United States.

	149
ANOTHER SLIDE, even more graphic, the number on the bow of the ship 
plainly visible...7541.

EVERYONE CAPTIVATED.	150

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is he still delirious?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(shrugging)
Can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him through to a pay phone down 
the hall.

PROF. HIKITA
In 1942, a U.S. Navy frigate, number 7541, disappeared on a clear day 
in the North Atlantic. Long thought to have been torpedoed, these 
pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the Eighth Dimension.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now wait a minute here...

PROF. HIKITA
Next transparency, please.

A loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector 
proves to be a remarkable image...

...of AN UPSIDE DOWN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIRATE VESSEL.	151

...Buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by Penny:	152

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo, don't forget your thruster.

...handing him the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER...Buckaroo declining it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You keep an eye on it.

PENNY PRIDDY
Any time. 

EXT.  OUTER SPACE - AFTERNOON	153

Meanwhile, several thousand miles overhead, a HUGE SPIKEY SPACECRAFT 
APPROACHES EARTH...

INT.  SPIKEY SPACECRAFT (FATHER SHIP) - AFTERNOON	154

A mysterious cloud room where BLACK BRRODING CREATURES perch upside 
down and sideways at controls in a smoky, vaporous environment, the 
only illumination EERIE YELLOW LIGHT...THE WALLS BREATHING.

BUCKAROO BANZAI'S VOICE
Mr. President--? You there?

MORE NOISES, THE SOUND OF TELEPHONE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT...

INT.  CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON	155

Back at a pay phone in the corridor, Buckaroo trying to figure out why 
the President doesn't answer. 

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus.  But they used the 
code.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. President--?  Some kind of interference...I can't...

Nothing from the other end except ODD SOUNDING COMPUTER BEEPS and the 
STATIC-LADEN VOICES of several operators...

RAWHIDE
Maybe it's just a prankster. Some computer whiz kid.

RENO
Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha Clearance.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to Radar Shield One)
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.

RAWHIDE
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this 
is on the level. We're busy people here.

	156
...when suddenly eerie, inexplicable things begin to occur...ALL HAVING 
TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY...the telephone book scooting closer to 
Buckaroo's fingers as if drawn by a magnet, the pages then turning, 
faster and faster...

	157
...Buckaroo amazed...now the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming 
shut, the phone simultaneously emitting a BIZARRE BUZZ...

	158
...and then Buckaroo gets literally the shock of his life...A MIGHTY 
ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE TELEPHONE...

...AND HURLING HIM OUT INTO THE COORIDOR!	159

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pencil!  Quick!  Pen!  Anything!

Reno complying, the lights returning to normal, Buckaroo dazed, his 
hand moving automatically, writing on any surface available.

A SPARK flying when he touches the metal-tipped pen to metal!	160

Buckaroo finally settling for his hand, SCRIBBLING NUMBERS ON HIS PALM.
	161

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON	162

PROF. HIKITA
Let me ask you to imagine the Oscillation Overthruster as a 
sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a steady stream of protons at a 
target-in this case a mountain-and the Jet Car as a giant super-
conducting magnet.

The Secretary of Defense fascinated.	163

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Sure, sure, but what about the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh 
Dimensions?

PENNY PRIDDY
(thumbing through her paperback)
I don't guess they matter.  It's like cheesecloth, I think.  Minkowiski 
space...

...as all eyes turn to see a still woozy Buckaroo Banzai returning, 
pointing dramatically at John Gomez and John O'Connor in the 
audience...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There!  Those two!  Don't panic...

The Cavaliers haven't a clue what he's talking about...

RENO
Whadda you mean, Buckaroo?  Where?  What?

	164
BUCKAROO'S POV...SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY...ACROSS THE ROOM, TWO GHASTLY 
ALIENS, GIANT RED ARACHTOIDS WEARING SUITS AND TIES, HOLDING COFFEE 
CUPS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Evil...pure and simple, from the eighth dimension! Grab 'em!

	165
RENO'S POV...NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY...neither Reno nor anyone else 
in the room seeing what Buckaroo does, seeing instead only those two 
redheaded gents who like their coffee sweet, John O'Connor and John 
Gomez...COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE THE CRIMSON CREATURES BUCKAROO THINKS 
ARE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids! Stop 'em!

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Arachtoids?

	166
Buckaroo breaking into a dead run across the room, those two astonished 
RED ALIENS racing for the nearest exit!

	167
The Hong Kong Cavaliers rushing to help Buckaroo when suddenly the 
PIERCING SCREAM of Penny Priddy causes them to stop in their tracks and 
look toward the dais...

...where yet NOTHER REDHEAD called JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, in glasses and dark 
suit, a bandanna over his face, has just stepped from behind the 
curtain and seized Professor Hikita, pointing a revolver at the old 
man's head...the Cavaliers instinctively stepping toward the dais, 
outraged...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Okay, wise guys! 

...the masked John Bigbooté FIRING once, wounding Reno in the 
shoulder...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Let those gun belts hit the floor! And nobody follows, or the prof is 
history! 

The pistol stuck in Professor Hikita's ear convincing the Cavaliers to 
obey, to watch helplessly as the kidnapper backs his victim through the 
curtain and out of sight...as new Jersey administers first aid to Reno 
and Penny strokes the fallen Cavalier's hair, berating the idle 
bystanders around them:

PENNY PRIDDY
Is this the kind of society you want?  A society of weak-kneed 
jellyfish wallowing in self-pity, prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us 
off like flies?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Or a society where we stand strong, take charge of our own destiny, 
with the cry "So far and no farther will we be pushed!"

INT.  HOTEL BOWELS - MOVING - AFTERNOON	168

Buckaroo in the meantime running down a flight of stairs...catching 
sight of his prey...THOSE TWO MONSTROUS RED ALIENS running through a 
swinging door...

...Buckaroo accelerating, hitting the door with every ounce of strength 
in him...

INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON	169

...Buckaroo flying through the door, taking a fall down concrete steps, 
finding himself in the hotel parking garage where a MOTORCYCLE SHOW is 
unloading equipment...

...Buckaroo spotting THREE SHADOWY FORMS halfway across the lot loading 
A LARGE CRATE into a van...

Buckaroo wasting no time going after the van, as it starts 
up...commandeering A FANCY NEW MOTORCYCLE, charging after the van 
despite an EXHIBITOR'S warning:

EXHIBITOR
Hey, you can't ride that! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON	170

The Cavaliers coming from two directions, colliding at an 
intersection...

PERFECT TOMMY
Any sign of Buckaroo?

RENO
No!  Ditto the professor-

RAWHIDE
Shit!

EXT.  CITY STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON	171

The van speeds by...the motorcycle pursues!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON	172

The chase continues, leaving the city behind...

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - LATER AFTERNOON	173

...the van coming straight toward us, thundering past...as Buckaroo and 
his motorcycle next roar INTO CAMERA in hot pursuit, and over his 
shoulder an AWESOME SIGHT...

...A DARK, UNNERVINGLY PREHISTORIC CREATURE FLYING DIRECTLY AT US, 
GROWING LARGER AND LARGER ON THE SCREEN, BUCKAROO UNAWARE OF ITS 
EXISTENCE...

EXT.  FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON	174

Twilight enveloping a New Jersey meadow as a pair of DUCK HUNTERS and 
their DOG takes advantage of the last half hour of fading daylight 
as...

...that BLACK CREATURE wings overhead!	175

	176
The duck hunters confused, frightened, FIRING, as a reflex reaction to 
this sudden threat from above!

	177
CLOSE ON the AWFUL BLACK CREATURE HIT, swooping low with a horrible 
shudder!

The hunters transfixed...	178

DUCK HUNTERS
My God!  What the hell...

The FRIGHTFUL sound of the CREATURE'S FAILING LUNGS...a terrific noise 
as the duck hunters hurry to where their unnatural kill hangs obscured 
in a gigantic tree...their dog running ahead, intent on retrieving this 
unusual "BIRD"...

EXT.  TREE - LATE AFTERNOON	179

The heavy-footed hunters SLOSHING THROUGH WATER, the first hunter to 
arrive on the scene using a sharp stick to poke at a BULGING BLADDER on 
the bottom of the strange creature, the sac bursting and drenching the 
hunter with a hideous viscous fluid...SPARKS!  AND A STRANGE BLUE 
DUST...

	180
...as suddenly AN ENORMOUS SPHERE drops out of the tree and begins 
rolling toward the hunter who poked that sac...

DUCK HUNTERS
Jesus Christ--!  What is it?

The other hunter following the ODD SPERE as it backs his buddy into a 
shallow swamp...the thing coming to a stop and...

	181
...A BLACK MAN with dreadlocks emerging from the top of the weird 
vessel, trying to balance himself when he slips and crashes to the 
ground, his neck breaking...a beam from his dropped 'flashlight' 
revealing him in death to be not a black man, but a BLACK ALIEN WITH A 
THREE-FINGERED HAND...

	182
...the hunters terrified as their dog starts snarling at the tree where 
now a second BLACK MAN has emerged, running for the road, jumping the 
fence like a gazelle...

	183
...the hunters not seeing this second individual, obsessed instead with 
a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK they've discovered in the dead alien's 
fingers.

1ST HUNTER
It's the latest issue!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - TWILIGHT	184

Buckaroo still on his MOTORCYCLE in pursuit of the van, taking a daring 
shortcut down a treacherous hillside...

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	185

Alien John Bigbooté at the wheel, alien John Gomez riding shotgun, in 
high spirits, cradling a DRY CELL BATTERY, his strange tongue upon it, 
getting high...his teeth glowing.

Bigbooté turning in his seat, overhearing alien John O'Connor operating 
a RADIO in the rear of the speeding van...

JOHN O'CONNOR
What? A black ship?  Where?
(listening)
A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?

John Bigbooté looking at John Gomez for any possible explanation.

JOHN GOMEZ
John Whorfin...maybe they know he's escaped!

JOHN O'CONNER
How?  How could they possibly know?  They're more than three trillion 
six hundred sixty million miles away.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
(jerking the wheel)
They know everything!  I told Whorfin to sit tight.  This could be the 
end of us all!  We gotta get Banzai's Overthruster and get off this 
rock!

EXT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	186

The van making a 180( turn!

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	187

John Bigbooté yelling back to John O'Connor:

JOHN O'CONNOR
I have a radio fix...

John Gomez opening the glove compartment, taking out a pistol:

JOHN GOMEZ
Death to the enemy!

JOHN O'CONNOR
Death to the enemy--!  Kill or die!

John Bigbooté just driving...his strange eyes set.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	188

Buckaroo rounding a curve on his motorcycle when that van is suddenly 
upon him, coming head on!

Buckaroo just having a split-second to catch the logo 'Yoyodyne' on the 
front of the van as he swerves into a ditch to avoid certain death...

	189
...Buckaroo quickly restarting the motorcycle and taking out A SWISS 
ARMY LIGHTER/MINIATURE TWO-WAY RADIO, making a call to:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide.  Come in.  Over.

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	190

Back in the press conference room, the anxious Cavaliers try to help 
several LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPES reconstruct the professor's kidnapping.  
A TINY BUZZER going off in Rawhide's pocket:  his SWISS ARMY CIGARETTE 
LIGHTER.  Rawhide turns his Back on everyone, taking out a pack of 
Luckies, lighting up as he talks quietly into the FLAME:

RAWHIDE
Over, Buckaroo.  What's up?  Where in Hades are you?  I'm getting a 
lotta static.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	191

Buckaroo pushing and shoving his motorcycle onto a woodland path...IT 
IS GETTING QUITE DARK...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the 
homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.

RAWHIDE
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The deuce you say.
(realizing)
That crate!

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	192

Elsewhere in the room, nervous and concerned, Penny Priddy sits apart 
from the others, thumping the keys of a piano...

RAWHIDE
What crate?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and 
dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.

RAWHIDE
(into flame)
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?

...Reno sitting down next to Penny at the piano, his wounded arm in a 
sling but his fingers nimble as ever...

PENNY PRIDDY
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?

RENO
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.

PENNY PRIDDY
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?

RENO
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted 
some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.

PENNY PRIDDY
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?

RENO
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.

Rawhide calling from across the room...

RAWHIDE
All right.  Let's go!  We got our work cut out for us tonight!

Reno getting up, Penny unsure at that moment whether she's being 
included, as those steely eyes of Rawhide zero in on her...

RAWHIDE
You, too, Miss Penny.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No thanks, I'm driving.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	195

The Yoyodyne van approaching the scene of the downed spacecraft, the 
headlights of the single HIGHWAY PATROL CAR illuminating the CORPSE OF 
THE DEAD CREATURE in the water...the HIGHWAY PATROLMAN pulling the 
figure out of the water, the hunters standing by...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Hand me that tarp. Let's cover this guy...

2ND HUNTER
What guy? He's got paws.

The other hunter tossing a plastic tarp over the body as they all turn 
to regard the headlights of the Yoyodyne van...the cop heading that 
way...

	196
BUCKAROO ARRIVING now too, scraping to a stop on his motorcycle in 
heavy brush, creeping closer to the crash site for a better look...

	197
BUCKAROO'S POV: The ungainly SPHERICAL SPACECRAFT and that amazing DEAD 
CREATURE on the ground, covered now with a sheet of semi-transparent 
plastic...observing John Bigbooté and John Gomez producing official 
I.D.s and appearing to BUCKAROO AS CRIMSON ALIENS...TO THE COPS AS...

ORDINARY CITIZENS:	198

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Bigbooté, Officer. Executive Vice President, Yoyodyne Propulsion 
Systems.

JOHN GOMEZ
(of the spacecraft)
One of our birds.

The highway patrolman returning Bigbooté's I.D., still a little 
skeptical about the whole thing, pointing to THE DEAD CREATURE UNDER 
PLASTIC.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That fella over there-that one of yours, too, is it?

John Bigbooté having a ready answer...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
The droid, you mean?

	199
Buckaroo moving quickly to the back of the van, starting to open the 
rear door with a locksmith's pick attached to his special SWISS ARMY 
LIGHTER.

JOHN O'CONNOR
Button up in there, Professor, if you know what's good for you.

John O'Connor stepping out for a smoke.

EXT.  VAN - NIGHT	203

Buckaroo watching the alien John O'Connor move off in the direction of 
the hunters, retrieving his dropped Swiss Army lighter, not noticing 
that the once blinking L.E.D. on the homing device has gone out!  
Buckaroo again picking the lock...

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	204

...ordinary citizen John O'Connor meanwhile observing the hunters still 
hanging around, one of them engrossed in the Buckaroo comic, his pal 
trying to figure out how to operate the dead alien's unusual 
flashlight...

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT	207

John Bigbooté, John Gomez, and the cop looming above the dead 
creature...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Looks like nothing I ever seen. I seen droids in space movies, but 
they're nothing like this-

JOHN GOMEZ
It's a three-man thermopod...

John Bigbooté shooting John Gomez a hard stare...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Thermopod?  What's a...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Very T.S.  Top Secret, right John Gomez?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Yeah, well, I was gonna call Buckaroo Banzai out here to have a look.  
Right up his alley, I think.

John Bigbooté's mood suddenly changing...tensing...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
You called Buckaroo Banzai?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Not yet.  I said I was gonna.

The three of them looking up at another pair of headlights arriving, A 
SEDAN, the cop yelling at them:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Go on!  Keep it moving!

JOHN GOMEZ
We got a truck on the way to mop things up for you.  Else this place 
could become a zoo, not to mention a haven for gawkers.

The highway patrolman moving off to deal with the sedan...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
We'll just go ahead and start breaking it down.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Don't touch it!  I got my own help on the way!  That's an order!

John Bigbooté frowning, telling John Gomez:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
There's a crowbar in the truck.

John Gomez nodding, heading back to the van...

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	208

...as Buckaroo pries his way into the crate, extracting the shaken 
Professor Hikita.

A SPARK dancing between them as they touch!	209

	210
PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than 
flapjacks.

PROF. HIKITA
What?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us.  
Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...

Buckaroo trying to show Professor Hikita the MATHEMATICAL FORMULA 
written on his hand.

PROF. HIKITA
You can see them? 

Buckaroo holding a finger to his lips...whispering...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. 
What is it?

PROF. HIKITA
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me 
scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.

Buckaroo opening the door to the van.

BUCKAROO SEES the red alien John Gomez coming closer...	211

	212
PROF. HIKITA
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.

PROF. HIKITA
Planet 10?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(pointing quickly)
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and 
start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions.  
Just synthesize it-

The professor still without the crucial information, however...John 
Gomez approaching...

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, the formula--

Thinking fast, Buckaroo presses the palm of his hand to Professor 
Hikita's forehead, the ball-point ink transferring...THE IMPORTANT 
FORMULA IMPRINTED IN REVERSE ON THE PROFESSOR'S SHINY PATE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Hurry!  Please.

Meanwhile back on Buckaroo's bus, in the nerve center, Rawhide and 
Perfect Tommy look at a BLANK OSCILLOSCOPE operated by a Blue Shield

RAWHIDE
Too long.  We better get somebody over there.  Put up the grid, last 
known location--

Trouble?

RAWHIDE
Nah-Damn sophisticated equipment always breaking down.

Reno wondering if there's more to it than Rawhide's saying...Rawhide 
losing himself in a copy of American Horseman.

Penny leaning forward, thinking, picking at a guitar left on the seat 
in front of her, watching the mysterious Hong Kong Cavaliers.

Perfect Tommy arriving, whispering something in Rawhide's ear, Rawhide 
nodding...

Penny looking over at Perfect Tommy across the aisle, Perfect Tommy 
confiscating the guitar...his guitar.

PENNY PRIDDY

Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that 
thing?

PENNY PRIDDY
Better than him.

The cop turning, shouting at John Gomez from his squad car:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Whadda you think you're doing?  Hey!

The cop in a jam, heading back toward the pod, as the two newly arrived 
redheads follow him despite his instructions:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
I said back off!  I mean it.  Now get in your car and get the hell 
outta here!

him again...

Wish life was so simple, Billy.  Remember that outfit the Justice 
Department checked into last year-Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?

BRAINY KID (BILLY)
The big space and weapons high tech consortium way behind on their 
delivery of the controversial new Truncheon Bomber?

PERFECT TOMMY
You got her.  Buckaroo's orders: access their data bank.  Attack their 
systems.  Up to it?

BILLY

Parker will get through!

THE ARACHTOID WING COMMANDER exchanging words with his second-in-

lunges out with HIS TELESCOPING ARM, chopping the cop's Adam's apple, 
knocking him to the ground...

kick O'Connor below the belt...dropping him to the turf...now spying 
yet another set of headlights coming down the road...

CLOSE TO DROPPING BUCKAROO!

CASPER LINDLEY
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the 
Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty 
tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll 
be worried.

Buckaroo reaching for the mike, relieved to feel only a SLIGHT 
ELECTRICAL CHARGE on touching it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not the famous Scooter....?

Wow.  You know it.

Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.

RAWHIDE
Grover's Mills, Grovers' Mills...1938.  Why's that so darn familiar?

RENO
Looks like none of these guys ever lived anywhere else.  No places of 
birth.  And all of them with the same first name: John.

New Jersey studying the screen...

NEW JERSEY

You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?

NEW JERSEY
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast 
that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were 
landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out 
to be a hoax.

Then that's it!

WALNUT FLYING OUT OF THE NIGHT!  A scream dying in Sam's throat as he 
clutches his heart, John Bigbooté dragging him back into the garage.

INT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	256

...while the red alien John Gomez remains outside as a lookout, the 
alien John O'Connor quickly peering into the locked Jet Car and 
smashing the window, searching in vain for the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Not here!  No Overthruster!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Whorfin will kill us!

JOHN O'CONNOR
You look!  It's not here!

JOHN GOMEZ
Professor Hikita!

EXT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	257

Outside, John Gomez making a startling discovery: the figure of 
Professor Hikita near an upstairs window of the research building only 
yards away...when suddenly overhead...

	258
GOMEZ'S POV...CASPER LINDLEY'S CHOPPER...landing behind a stand of 
trees as the alien intruders scatter for cover.

INT.  DEN - NIGHT	259

Mrs. Johnson sitting near a crackling fire, at a small desk stacked 
high with books and papers, her nose in an advanced chemical 
engineering text.

...looking up as the front door opens, admitting Buckaroo Banzai, 
Casper and Scooter bringing up the rear...

MRS. JOHNSON
Buckaroo!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is the professor here? Where's Penny?

MRS. JOHNSON
Both of 'em safe and sound. What's going on?  Everybody's freakin' out.

A shaken Rawhide, Reno, Perfect Tommy appearing on the stairway...

RENO 
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What? How do you know that?

RAWHIDE
It's all on the record. Come on-

Buckaroo heading up the stairs...

	260
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY...BUCKAROO MOVING QUICKLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR with his 
men, being debriefed on the run:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect 
Tommy?  The invisible body?

PERFECT TOMMY
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 
at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

RENO
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and 
they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?

PERFECT TOMMY
Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing 
around with his own stupid Overthruster.

RAWHIDE
Faulty design.  It sucked.

RENO
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep 
that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension 
when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind 
snapped?  Of course!  What else?

PERFECT TOMMY
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to 
talk to the head honcho.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It?  Who does?

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	261

Professor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at...

	262
...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce 
TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES...

	263
...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON 
HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	264

...while Billy places John Parker's UNUSUAL YELLOW RECORD on a 
turntable in Buckaroo's cluttered office...Casper and Scooter and the 
Cavaliers seeking protection behind a PLEXIGLAS 'BLACKBOARD', their 
faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations...

	265
...Buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer, FASCINATED TO SEE HE 
STILL POSSESSES ENOUGH STATIC ELECTRICITY IN HIS HAND TO DRAW A SHEET 
OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET!

RENO 
Stand back, man...

	266
...as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry 
of SMOKE AND SPARKS, A GORGEOUS BLACK HUMAN FEMAL sizzles up from the 
grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air...A HOLOGRAM!

HOLOGRAM
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Emdall from Planet 10.  
A common grave danger confronts both our worlds.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	267

Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs. Johnson advances with a load of 
cold beers and Birdseye burritos...passing by a figure frozen in the 
shadows...OUR POV: THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR.  Mrs. Johnson gone, none 
the wiser.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	268

Mrs. Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight 
of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room...

MRS. JOHNSON
Oh, wow...

Reno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the 
HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the 
corner of Buckaroo's desk...

	269
JOHN EMDALL
After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, 
the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as 
your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and 
condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend 
eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed 
too good for their ilk.

	270
RENO
Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her?

MRS. JOHNSON
She's not in her room...I looked.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing?

	271
JOHN EMDALL
Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and 
the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely 
away on another plane of existence.

	272
Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere 
in the room...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
"John Parker" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike 
dressed up in aluminum foil.  With a weird album...how the hell was I 
supposed to know he came from outer space?

Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the HOLOGRAM...

John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man...	273

JOHN EMDALL
And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin 
further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns 
us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back 
through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should 
attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic 
communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to 
Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.

PERFECT TOMMY
An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American 
first strike!

JOHN EMDALL
Exactly, Perfect Tommy.  The Soviets will retaliate.  Your President 
Widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike...and within twenty 
minutes the danger to Planet 10 will be removed...

RENO
God, if it's not one thing it's another.

JOHN EMDALL
But...because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your 
planet.  Stop John Whorfin before sunrise! If you fail we will be 
forced to help you destroy yourselves.  End of discussion.

	274
There's an awful pause...and then a SCREECH as John Emdall spirals 
downward into the grooves of the record again.

	275
CASPER LINDLEY
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You wanna take the chance, Casper?

CASPER LINDLEY
Not me. No way.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula.  
Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!

Buckaroo heading for the door...

RENO
Where're you goin'?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To get my guns.

PERFECT TOMMY
His guns?  Holy shit.

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	276

...Professor Hikita and his assistant leaning over the electron tube 
apparatus, removing a rubber stopper from one of the receptacles, in 
the process GETTING AN ACCIDENTAL WHIFF of that BIZARRE GLOWING GREEN 
COMPOUND...Professor Hikita and assistant letting out gasps, seeing a 
sight that nearly stops their hearts...

THEIR POV	277

AT THE WINDOW...JOHN BIGBOOTÉ...AND A RED ARACHTOID!

	278
Professor Hikita, petrified, stepping back, grabbing the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER and knocking over a chair, as THE ALIEN CREATURE smashes 
the window!

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDOR - NIGHT	279

Rawhide, hearing screams from the Professor's laboratory, races down 
the corridor, gun drawn...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	280

Buckaroo coming into his bedroom, opening a dresser drawer when 
suddenly...A NOISE BEHIND HIM!  Buckaroo whirling instinctively with 
twin EBONY HANDLED COLTS a fraction of a second from firing...at PENNY!

...the latter poking her head out of Buckaroo's closet just long enough 
to see him aim his silver pistols, jumping back into the closet, 
slamming the door...an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the 
closet, finding it locked...knocking...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open up or I'll shoot it off.

PENNY PRIDDY
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I 
thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like 
me.

Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, 
seeing THE PHOTOGRAPH on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet-
so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo...his pretty companion A DEAD 
RINGER FOR PENNY.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, look-

PENNY'S VOICE
You look.  Who is she?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's 
maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet 
door.

PENNY'S VOICE
Yeah, whose world is coming to an end?  You only wanted me because I 
remind you of her.

Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with 
arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we 
got married, and that's about all I can say.  Right now.
(no response)
Penny?

A silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking...slowly 
opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female 
clothing...

PENNY PRIDDY
Married--?  So that's it!  Buckaroo Banzai, a married man.  Where is 
she?  With the kids some place?

Buckaroo turning...Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul...

PENNY PRIDDY
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like 
you...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was killed, Penny.

PENNY PRIDDY
Oh, my.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.

A pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back 
to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the 
dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories...

PENNY PRIDDY
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around 
here!

PENNY PRIDDY
How did she die?  I wanna know.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You don't wanna know.

PENNY PRIDDY
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.

PENNY PRIDDY
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime 
League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of 
Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I wish he was.  He's real enough.

Penny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his 
guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a 
BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed 
photograph of Peggy...

PENNY PRIDDY
God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which 
I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget 
her though.

One look at Buckaroo says it all...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Never.

PENNY PRIDDY
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got 
mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go where?  Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(squatting close to her)
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic.  
Because it's gonna be all right.

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.

PENNY PRIDDY
Believe in Penny Priddy?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Absolutely.

Penny looks into his eyes...

PENNY PRIDDY
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another 
adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go 
with you.  Please...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's too dangerous.

PENNY PRIDDY
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...

Starry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige 
when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK...

...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in...
	281

PERFECT TOMMY
(breathless)
Buckaroo--! Sorry--

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is it, Tommy?

PERFECT TOMMY
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going 
haywire over at the lab...

Buckaroo running for the door, calling over his shoulder to Penny:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stay here, I'll be back.

PENNY PRIDDY
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	282

Buckaroo, the Cavaliers, and the Lindleys race out of the house toward 
the research building...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	283

Penny hurriedly changes clothes...puts on Peggy's clothes...when 
suddenly THE SIGHT OF JOHN O'CONNOR standing in the hallway door, 
leering at her...

PENNY PRIDDY
Whadda you want?

John O'Connor, remembering her from the press conference...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Nothing right now, Penny Priddy.

John O'Connor vanishing...Penny again at a loss...

INT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE - NIGHT	284

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers running inside, racing up a bright yellow 
staircase to the second floor...

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	285

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers entering, finding the motionless lab 
assistant in Professor Hikita's wrecked laboratory...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Dead.  Damnit!

PERFECT TOMMY
Where's the professor?

RENO
Where's Rawhide?

CASPER
Who'd do a thing like this?

NEW JERSEY
Arachtoids.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Spread out. They can't be far.

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDORS - NIGHT	286

SHOTS of Cavaliers in empty hallways, guns drawn, discovering evidence 
of intruders...OFFICES RANSACKED, FURNITURE UPSET...EXPERIMENTS FOULED 
UP...

	287
...Buckaroo turning a corner, finding a SMALL AMOUNT OF SMOKE in the 
hallway...turning the corner...

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	288

...stepping into a LARGE ROOM clouded with SMOKE from a burning file 
cabinet, Rawhide and a HULDING FORM struggling in the gloom...

...Buckaroo unable to get a clear shot at the beast when suddenly 
Rawhide succeeds in knocking his adversary to the floor, the "man" 
HISSING!

RAWHIDE
Look out, Buckaroo!

Rawhide putting himself in the line of fire, suddenly clutching his 
lower back...Buckaroo starting toward Rawhide but...

RAWHIDE
Behind you!

Buckaroo turning as THE SHADOW OF THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR falls on his 
back!

...Buckaroo firing his guns, wounding the creature, the disoriented 
FIGURE retreating out into the corridor as Buckaroo turns in time to 
see Rawhide's assailant dive into a hole in the floor!  A hole in the 
floor?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You okay?

RAWHIDE
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the 
Overthruster...

Buckaroo edging toward that strange orifice in the linoleum, going into 
it himself...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT	289

As Penny rushes in, her ears picking up weird noises...THE SOUND OF 
PEOPLE in the acoustical tiles overhead...Penny trying to follow the 
racket down the first-floor hallway...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	290

Buckaroo in the dim light of the crawl space, making his way past air-
conditioning ducts toward the sound of someone or something crawling up 
ahead...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Professor--!?

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Here, Buckaroo!

SOUNDS IN THE DARKNESS, Buckaroo holding his pistol still at the ready 
but useless in these cramped quarters...Buckaroo finding a worklight, 
flicking it on...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	291

Penny meanwhile following the NOISES AND VOICES OVERHEAD into an empty 
office, grabbing a ladder and knocking out a ceiling panel...

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo!  Rawhide!  Reno?  Anybody?

	292
ANOTHER POV...unfortunately someone else is watching Penny from inside 
that very office...the wounded John O'Connor sitting in a swivel desk 
chair behind the door, oozing blood of a strange color and consistency, 
staring ferociously at Penny...MORE CLATTER OVERHEAD...as Penny 
elevates herself partially into the hole...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	293

PENNY'S POV...Professor Hikita only yards away, on his belly, able to 
come no further, unable to wedge himself beneath a large duct...the 
arachtoid John Bigbooté closing in behind the professor...Buckaroo 
closing in behind Bigbooté.

PROF.  HIKITA
Take it, young lady!  Grab it!

	294
Unseen by John Bigbooté, the OVERTHRUSTER skittering across the crawl 
space and into Penny's hands!

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	295

Penny stepping down off the chair and onto the desk top, her back still 
to the wounded John O'Connor as she quickly stuffs the OVERTHRUSTER 
into her purse...an action unseen by the ghastly, bleeding thug who...

	296
...EXTENDS HIS ARM UP AND ACROSS THE ROOM...HIS HUMAN HAND TIGHTENING 
AROUND HER MOUTH...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	297

Buckaroo advancing toward the professor...

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Go back, Buckaroo!

The arachtoid John Bigbooté whirling, firing a STINGER that whizzes 
past Buckaroo's head, missing by inches...as Buckaroo FIRES 
twice...John Bigbooté screaming...kicking at a small fresh air vent, 
somehow squeezing his huge body out the tiny opening like a rat.

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	298

Buckaroo helping Professor Hikita up out of the floor...Rawhide lying 
very still now, surrounded by Reno, Perfect Tommy and New Jersey...

...one look between New Jersey and Buckaroo sufficient to tell us that 
Rawhide hasn't got a chance...Buckaroo kneeling beside his old pal, 
Rawhide forcing a smile...

RAWHIDE
You're a welcome sight...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Just 'grazed' you, huh?

New Jersey extracting a strange MANY-PRONGED STINGER from Rawhide's 
back.  Buckaroo looking at it...Rawhide maintaining a sense of humor...

RAWHIDE
Apache?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoid.

RAWHIDE
So I was right.  That's nice to know...

Across the room, Pinky Carruthers comes in with Casper and Scooter 
Lindley, and that black man from Planet 10, John Parker...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to...

Pinky's words catching in his throat as he sees Rawhide's condition.

	299
Buckaroo turning, seeing not a 'guy' but A GIANT ARACHTOID standing 
there...

	300
Rawhide fading fast, Buckaroo lobbing the STINGER to "John Parker"...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Any antidote for these things?

John Parker holding the stinger in his palm...

JOHN PARKER
No, none.

...as it suddenly comes alive!  He drops it to the floor, stomps it to 
death...

PERFECT TOMMY
That mean you're on our side?

RAWHIDE
(sinking)
We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo.

Buckaroo turning from the BLACK ARACHTOID to his dying buddy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
We will, old fried, we will.

RAWHIDE
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...

BUT RAWHIDE CLOSING HIS EYES FOR THE FINAL TIME, as Buckaroo feels for 
a pulse...the look in the great man's eyes saying it all...sadness 
mixed with anger...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There's another one we owe 'em.

...THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER STARTING UP...

CASPER LINDLEY
They're stealing my chopper!

The Cavaliers racing for the window...

RENO
And they got Penny!  Look!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't shoot!

PROF. HIKITA
She has the Overthruster!

JOHN PARKER
Then your planet is doomed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No!
(calmer)
We'll get it back.

Buckaroo shoving Perfect Tommy aside, at the window himself now.

	301
BUCKAROO'S POV...a fleeting glimpse of THE STOLEN LINDLEY CHOPPER...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	302

CLOSE ON the familiar face of the Secretary of Defense seen from an 
unusual angle...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL PRESIDENT WIDMARK lying on his 
belly, surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of 
government, staring down at a special mirror that reflects his 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary pressing a point further an 
igniting a Camel with a lighter from the President's nightstand.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
It's not Buckaroo Banzai per se, Mr. President. It's his men...some of 
then foreigners...Asiatics, their names changed, their true backgrounds 
shrouded in secrecy! I mean, when you come right up against it, what do 
we really know about any of 'em?

A NURSE appears with two little pills...

NURSE
These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That's okay, Bonnie, I won't be operating any heavy machinery today.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(desperate)
We've never had a weapon like the Jet Car in the past, Mr. President.  
Light-weight, highly mobile, stick on some anti-tank missiles, a couple 
grenade launchers, hell, we could buy ourselves two hundred Jet Cars 
for the price of ten tanks, send 'em swarming all over Ivan like bumble 
bees, sir, right clear through their precious little Iron Curtain like 
it was Swiss cheese!  They gotta be just scared shitless!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
As are all sane men today.

SECREATRY OF DEFENSE
Hey, and me too.  That's why I'm saying until Buckaroo Banzai agrees to 
submit his boys to at least a routine government security check, that 
Jet Car should be in the hands of Defense, and if they won't sell us 
the technology, then Mr. President, by God, sir, we have got to take 
it!  In the national interest.

The lighter in the Secretary's hand suddenly BEEPING, startling him and 
prompting the President to claim the gizmo and point it at...

	303
...an astounding TV-telephone where the FACE OF BUCKAROO BANZAI 
APPEARS...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it 
like out there in the real world?

Secretary of Defense McKinley stepping around behind the bed, coming 
into Buckaroo's field of vision...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something 
very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like 
the Earth's caught in a crossfire.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT	304

On a highway somewhere near the Eastern seaboard, Buckaroo's bus speeds 
toward Yoyodyne...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	305

Buckaroo standing at a TV-telephone in his MOBILE ELECTRONIC NERVE 
CENTER, the arachtoidal John Parker right at his side amid a flurry of 
activity... technicians accumulating INFO on THE ALIEN FATHER SHIP FROM 
PLANET 10...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To cut right to the bottom line on this, sir, we have reason to believe 
that there are moving freely among us, vicious red aliens disguised as 
the owners and operators of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

...Perfect Tommy, Reno, even Casper Lindley, coming in and out of the 
picture, transforming themselves into a crack commando unit donning 
assault/chemical-warfare uniforms...little Scooter Lindley among them, 
too, doing like his dad.

	306
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Yoyodyne Propulsion?  The people working on our Truncheon bomber?  
Under control of alien nationals?  Reds?  Commies, you say?

	307
...New Jersey studying an initial computer enhancement of THE AWESOME 
BLACK ARACHTOID SHIP HEADED TOWARD EARTH...

	308
BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not exactly, Mr. Secretary, no.  Real aliens.  Giant red arachtoids 
camouflaged as human beings...and what they're really building, forget 
your Truncheon bomber, Mr. Secretary, is this enormous rocketship to 
escape back through the Eighth Dimension and then on to Planet 10.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Now wait one second...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The gentleman standing here with me is called John Parker, and he can 
corroborate everything I've said because he's from Planet 10 too.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	309

The President dumbfounded...John Parker on TV appearing as nothing more 
than a wild and wooly Rastafarian...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo...you and I, we go back a long, long way together...but...

JOHN PARKER ON TV
(interrupting)
Time is short, Mr. President. To prevent John Whorfin's escape, my 
comrades are at this moment taking up a geostationary position over New 
Jersey. This situation is explosive!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Explosive? What are you saying, man? Some kind of race war in New 
Jersey--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, sir.  This 'man' as you call him, is not a human being, Mr. 
President.  He's a black arachtoid.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
That's some kind of spider, isn't it?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	310

New Jersey joins Professor Hikita at a microscope, analyzing a slide 
smeared with that weird alien 'blood'...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Buckaroo, my good friend...I'd like to help you...but don't you think I 
would've heard from my SAC radar by now if...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	311

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
SAC wouldn't know what to look for, sir.  Because these black 
arachtoids are cleverly hidden inside a huge thundercloud.

The Secretary of Defense takes action, picks up a phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Get me John Bigboote at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, Inc.  Then...
(to the President)
...the FBI.  Let's see if this spade's wanted.  What the hell's his 
name again?  Jackson?

JOHN PARKER ON TV
Parker.  I have delivered a hologram from my president, John Emdall, 
who has made it clear that unless John Whorfin is destroyed at once, 
she intends to fire an atomic beam from your American airspace...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
A what?

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are 
ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other 
off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each 
other pretty well, I think.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
John...?  John Bigboote?  Right, Bigbooté, sorry.  Anyway, hey, guy, 
how's everything over there at Yoyodyne?  How's my big bomber coming?  
Nothing out of the, you know, ordinary?  Spiders?  I know you're 
busy...lunch?  Sounds good...when's good for you?  Next Tuesday?  I'm 
writing it down in my book.  See you then...Uncle Sam's treat.

The Secretary writes nothing down, hangs up, looking unsatisfied with 
the conversation just concluded.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	312

Buckaroo glancing over at Professor Hikita and New Jersey, the latter 
squinting into the microscope...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Well.  I don't know what to say, Buckaroo...aliens from Planet 10, 
nuclear extortion, spiders in thunder clouds, a girl named "John"...

NEW JERSEY
There's your answer!  Electromagnetic bacterial crap!

PROF. HIKITA
Programmable!

NEW JERSEY
We inhale the bacteria.  It swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms 
our consciousness.  Diabolical.  We only see what they want us to see.

PROF. HIKITA
Electric brainwashing.

John Parker nearby, helping Reno synthesize more of Professor Hikita's 
ARACHTOIDAL ANTIDOTE and pour the liquid into GAS MASK FILTERS...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY STEPPING CLOSER INTO THE PICTURE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Just curious, Buckaroo, but where's the Jet Car at these days?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I've got it, Mr. Secretary.  But unfortunately the Oscillation 
Overthruster is in Penny Priddy's possession and she's been kidnapped 
and taken to Yoyodyne, further exacerbating the situation. We're on our 
way there right now.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	313

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Who the hell's Penny Priddy?

The Secretary of Defense giving the President a sly 'I told you so' 
look...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	314

Perfect Tommy coming over, interrupting...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, John Parker has the arachtoid cloud on line 2!

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	315

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Excuse me a moment, Mr. President.  We're talking to the cloud right 
now.

And his image fades.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Good God...

The President picks up the phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command. I want 
some hard data on that cloud. We got any killer satellites over Jersey-
-?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	316

Everyone studying a much MORE DETAILED COMPUTER ENHANCEMENT of the 
alien cloud...

The Alien John Parker on the phone, whispering...	317

RENO 
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to John Parker)
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.

JOHN PARKER
(into phone)
Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a virtue, Wing Commander, sir.

Perfect Tommy interrupting again, holding yet another telephone...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?

INT.  SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	318

Meanwhile in a grimy narrow control booth high above the factory floor, 
a terrified Penny Priddy sits BOUND and GAGGED, John O'Connor SPREADING 
THE CONTENTS FROM A HONEY-BEAR SQUEEZE BOTTLE over her naked arms while 
long trails of ORDINARY PICNIC ANTS make their way up her legs...John 
Bigbooté looking on...

Penny's UNOPENED big clear plastic purse on Doctor Lizardo's desk, the 
OVERTHRUSTER right under his nose and he doesn't even know it as he 
speaks into the phone handed to him by an ASSISTANT.  BEGIN 
INTERCUTTING.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Well, well...Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you don't remember me?  Ah, I'm 
flattered.  We know the same people.  In fact, one of them is here with 
me now...your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.

	319
BUCKAROO BANZAI
"Doctor"--?

	320
DOCTOR LIZARDO
May I pass along my congratulations for your great achievement.  In the 
miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly enshrined! However...
(a pause)
...Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem. And provide the 
crucial missing circuit for my Overthruster.  Perhaps you can convince 
her to try.

Lizardo holding the phone toward Penny, ripping her gag off...

PENNY PRIDDY
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me! 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny--?!  Are you all right?

Doctor Lizardo yanking the phone from Penny, remaining silent for a 
second to torture Buckaroo's soul...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She knows nothing, Lizardo.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Then shall we say "A Penny for your thoughts?" You can come in her 
place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone, with your Overthruster!
(hanging up)
He'll bring it.  I know his type.

Penny glancing surreptitiously at her large transparent purse, THE 
OVERTHRUSTER IN A JUMBLE OF COSMETICS!

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Take her to the pit!  Use more honey.  Find out what she knows.

Smiling smugly, Lizardo heads for the door, Penny squirming in her seat 
as the TINY ANTS dig in...

PENNY PRIDDY
Who are you?  Hanoi Shan?  The Scourge of Burma!  The Pivot of Mystery?  
Well, you're not destroying me like you did my sister!

Lizardo simply sneering at her as he goes out the door...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT	321

A flurry of well-ordered activity taking place...Hong Kong Cavaliers 
and Blue Shield Irregulars along with Pinky Carruthers.  Casper and 
Scooter...sitting up front like paratroopers, cleaning their back-pack 
FLAMETHROWERS...SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS...Buckaroo giving them a chalk talk, 
an aerial photograph of Yoyodyne on the clear plexiglas 'blackboard'...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see 
them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't 
be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we 
fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.

JOHN PARKER
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.

Buckaroo nodding...THE CAVALIERS BREATING THEIR ANTIDOTE FILTERS, 
SEEING NOW "THE ALIEN" JOHN PARKER WITH A MIXTURE OF DISBELIEF AND 
HORROR...Casper and Scooter Lindley especially unsettled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the Overthruster.  
That'll be my job: get it back in one piece.  Here's the main gate.  
I'll pass through first, alone.  The rest of you divide into two strike 
groups-Apache Team...that's you, Reno...and Chaparral Team, Perfect 
Tommy.  John Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

Perfect Tommy not too thrilled about that.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Top priority is the Overthruster. Whorfin can't escape without it. The 
built-in tracking device should make it relatively simple to 
locate...maybe hard to get.

INT.  BOWELS OF YOYODYNE - NIGHT	322

Penny being dragged by John O'Connor through a slimy underground 
corridor, past a strange piece of machinery.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT	323

The President of the United States talks into a cigarette lighter and 
peeks up a nurse's skirt by means of his floor mirror...

	324
MIRRORED POV:  The nurse's reflection replaced by that of his NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR...

	325
PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody 
figure this lighter out?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
No, sir.  I think the flint...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
What's happening with my call to SAC?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They 
report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no 
cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same 
problem.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Should we be on Code Red?

GENERAL CATBURD
We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red...no sense jumping off 
half-cocked, Mr. President.

The President twisting around to glower at Catburd eating an orange, 
sitting near a table of flowers and fruit baskets.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
I don't know...Buckaroo Banzai's never been wrong before.

Senator Cunningham pacing nervously...

GENERAL CATBURD
The man went through solid matter, for crying out loud. Who knows what 
it did to his brain...maybe scrambled his molecules. All I'm saying is, 
let's not panic here!  I'm sure there's a rational explanation...

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(turning from a strange phone)
Russian radar is down, sir.  They've just gone to Code Red.

Silence.  And then calmly and quietly:

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
We've got no choice then.  Call my wife.

The National Security Advisor turning back to his telephone:

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Code Red.  "Butch says we're crimson."

GENERAL CATBURD
Mr. President, none of us here are lunatics or irrational men...
(looking at Cunningham)
...or persons.  I'm a soldier and I'm a damn good one, enough 
decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don't mind telling you, I'm 
sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am scared. I'm 
barely holding my fudge right now.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself 
together.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts!
(pause)
Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first.  They think 
we're godless monsters just like them.  Put yourself in their 
samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over 
the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming 
into the Great Hall of the People.  Now, do you think they're gonna 
listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do 
you think they will?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(being handed a dispatch)
Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours.  We're both totally 
defenseless.  More or less.

GENERAL CATBURD
Hail Mary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
So what's our counter option, General Catburd?  Earn your salary.

GENERAL CATBURD
I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir.  Hit 'em 
primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their 
heads and do it to us first.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Larry, where's my Football?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Out in the hall, sir.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT	326

An apple-cheeked Marine Lieutenant sits watching a television soap 
opera, only the sinister BLACK BRIEFCASE chained to his wrist setting 
him apart from missions of other viewers...General Catburd sticking his 
head out of the President's room...

GENERAL CATBURD
What're you waiting for, boy?  Get in here with that thing.

...as an out-of-breath Mrs. Johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates, 
out-foxing SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and the rest of the President's 
entourage, cutting through, clutching the YELLOW RECORD...

MRS. JOHNSON
For the President!  From Buckaroo Banzai!

EXT.  RENDEZVOUS POINT - NIGHT	327

A dimly lighted parking lot not far from Yoyodyne.  A KOLODNY BROS. 
PLUMBING VAN arrives, disgorging several tough BLUE SHIELDS as Buckaroo 
and Professor Hikita confer...the alien John Parker doing some highly 
unusual warm-up exercises on the tarmac...Reno telling the arriving 
Blue Shields:

RENO
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.

PERFECT TOMMY
Asshole probably got lost.

NEW JERSEY
Or nailed for speeding.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can I have everyone's attention?  I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm 
not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight.  
It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and 
we all saw what happened to Rawhide.  So if for any reason this is 
good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs...

Buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to 
him, the Cavaliers smiling, needling him...

RENO
What, Buckaroo?  You trying to tell us something?

The JET CAR racing up, skidding to a stop, Billy jumping out, the big 
engine still running.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let's just fry those arachtoids.

Buckaroo embracing Professor Hikita, turning back to his men, pulling 
on his helmet:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Give me thirty minutes.  Then come in and mop up.

Buckaroo tossing a quick Blue Shield salute, shutting himself into his 
speed machine.

PROF. HIKITA'S POV as Buckaroo blasts off...an exhaust trail of white 
smoke as he rockets up the highway!

INT.  YOYODYNE - NIGHT	329

Penny Priddy, more bedraggled and filthy than ever, being dragged by 
John O'Connor deeper into the bowels of Yoyodyne, down a flooded 
subterranean corridor...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	330

CLOSE ON THE PRESIDENT'S FACE...JOHN EMDALL'S VOICE OVER...talking 
thermonuclear war...wrapping her speech up...WHOOSH!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Well... that's certainly food for thought.

	331
Mrs. Johnson lifting the needle off the SMOKING RECORD...as the 
President's National Security Advisor places a call on that ominous 
STRANGE PHONE, a palpable tension rising, urgency bordering on panic...

...General Catburd and the young Marine lieutenant rummaging through a 
confusion of envelops in the BLACK BRIEFCASE.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
No answer at the Kremlin, sir. Just dead silence.

GENERAL CATBURD
Here you go, Mr. President...the Sealed Authenticators.  The Plan D 
Documents for your eyes only...John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves 
a knockout little force posture...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
You know, on second thought, maybe we should think this through a bit 
more so that future generations of...

THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM START TO BLINK ON AND OFF...silencing the 
Senator...Catburd handing the President a writing implement...pulling 
out a special writing tray from the bed...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
"Name of the enemy"?  What, Planet 10?  My hand's shaking.  How on 
earth can I even...have to stay awake, alert...that's my job.  That's 
what the people put me here for.

INT.  FATHER SHIP - NIGHT	332

Meanwhile inside the strange vaporous entity...BLACK CREATURES scuttle 
about their jobs in semi-darkness, monitoring the Earth below...

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Where is Buckaroo Banzai?

BLACK ARACHTOID AT SCOPE
John Parker tells us he's approaching Yoyodyne, Wing Commander, sir.

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Keep me posted.

the chain link barrier, swinging it open...

INT.  SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	334

In the nerve center of Yoyodyne, a nervous John Bigbooté watches Dr. 
Lizardo addressing his ragtag followers on the floor below...Bigbooté 
with his hands on Lizardo's mike cord, trying to get up enough nerve to 
pull the plug on his boss...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Blacks are on this planet! Here in New Jersey! Coming to destroy us! We 
must move! Escape or die! 

	335
OVER LIZARDO'S SHOULDER: A view down below on the littered floor of a 
huge aircraft factory that houses a GIANT SPOACESHIP OF BIZARRE DESIGN, 
a customized 747, wingless, jagged, the entire vehicle suspended twenty 
feet off the floor on movable cranes, work ladders stretching up to its 
several doors...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You must work faster to finish the Great Vehicle. So that we can enter 
the Eighth Dimension and free our trapped comrades! So we can return to 
our homeland and seize power once again! 

...Lizardo's followers extending their three-fingered hands in fascist 
salutes as he whips them into a feverish state:

BACK TO:	336

DR. LIZARDO
Where are we going?  Tell me!

RED ARACHTOIDS
To Planet 10!

DR. LIZARDO
When?

RED ARACHTOIDS
Real soon!

Dr. Lizardo peers down at the hangar floor.

HIS POV of the JET CAR locked in the iron jaws of a GIGANTIC ROLLING 
MACHINE...

INT.  JET CAR/LAUNCH HANGAR - NIGHT	338

The Jet Car's engine shut down, Buckaroo CHECKING HIS OVERTHRUSTER 
HOMING DEVICE as he's trundled toward John Gomez, in a graveyard of 
HUGE YELLOW SPIKES, his eyes taking in everything, from the last-minute 
preparation of the GIANT SPACECRAFT to:

	339
BUCKAROO'S POV...the evil figures of Dr. Lizardo and John Bigbooté 
standing high in the speed operator's pulpit...

	340
Buckaroo yanked out of the cockpit...John Gomez poking at the JET CAR'S 
dashboard, ripping out its cassette deck, finding the crucial 
Overthruster missing and shaking his head in Lizardo's direction.

JOHN GOMEZ
Not here!

THEIR POV	341

An angry John Bigbooté racing down the stairs toward the Jet Car...as 
over the PUBLIC ADDRESS BOOMS:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
WHERE IS THE OVERTHRUSTER!

BACK TO:	342

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I thought you had it!

For that seemingly flippant but honest answer, Buckaroo gets punched by 
John Bigbooté...doubling him over...

DR. LIZARDO'S VOICE
Take him to the Shock Tower!

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	343

Murky, dank, an insect paradise...Buckaroo standing trapped inside an 
ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD...John Bigbooté looking on...

...Dr. Lizardo flashing two separate, incredibly complex ELECTRICAL 
DIAGRAMS on A MONITOR SCREEN in rapid-fire order.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Solve them! The shock tower is a lie detector. Any untruth triggers a 
brutal charge to your auditory meatus...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You're not getting a damn thing outta me until Penny's safe.

DR. LIZARDO
Curse you, Banzai! Don't you realize what you're saying? Your planet's 
about to be destroyed, and you're wasting time like this...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I've got nothing but time.

CLOSE ON THE POLYGRAPH NEEDLE SUDDENLY JUMPING!	344

	345
THE TOWER ZAPPING BUCKAROO, A FIERCE ELECTRIC SHOCK TOSSING HIM BACK 
AND FORTH LIKE A RAG DOLL...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife...doomed is your soul, and 
damned is your life!

Lizardo pressing a button, administering a second SHOCK to Buckaroo, 
while an aide turns a dial, INCREASING THE VOLTAGE

DOCTOR LIZARDO
I want my missing circuit now!

INT/EXT.  PRESIDENT'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT	346

A VIEW OVER THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE'S SHOULDER as the chopper 
descends, lands in a parking lot where Buckaroo's bus sits guarded by 
Cavaliers and Blue Shields...THE CAMERA FOLLOWING the Secretary right 
out into it all...A CARPET CLEANING VAN ARRIVING, THREE MORE TOUGH BLUE 
SHIELD IRREGULARS REPORTING FOR WORK..."THE RUG SUCKERS".

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Who the hell are those guys?  Where's Buckaroo?

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	347

Buckaroo still held in his electric straitjacket...Lizardo nodding to 
the ARACHTOID in charge of a bank of glowing closed circuit TV 
sets...the same picture popping onto every set:  PENNY HANGING IN "THE 
PIT".

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You bloody--!

DOCTOR LIZARDO
She'll live...for a while, and she won't enjoy it.

Lizardo indicates his favorite monitor...the INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER 
equation flashing across its face.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Only you can save her from the fate of your friend, Mr. Rawhide!  Solve 
this equation.  I must have the crucial missing circuit.

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR...a riot of circuits and junctions...	348

BACK TO:	349

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin.

DR. LIZARDO
Whorfin?  How do you know that's my real name?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
John Emdall told me.

Buckaroo smiles at Lizardo's surprise, Lizardo signaling John Bigbooté 
who turns on the voltage, ZAPPING Buckaroo!

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS (PARKED) - NIGHT	350

The Secretary of Defense pacing the aisle of the bus, looking at his 
watch while the Cavaliers and newly arrived Blue Shields conceal their 
eagerness for battle...checking watches, cleaning weapons.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Anybody got a report-anybody got anything?  Or are we still blacked 
out?

Perfect Tommy looking back into World Watch One...

PERFECT TOMMY
Light precipitation.  Partly cloudy tomorrow.

SECREATARY OF DEFENSE
This bus should be in the hands of Defense.

...Scooter Lindley, wearing a gas mask, approaches the alien John 
Parker with a BLUE SHIELD BALLPOINT PEN and a piece of paper...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Could I have your autograph, Mr. Parker?

John Parker at first not understanding the nature of the 
request...looking at the ball-point pen, Scooter flipping the point for 
him...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Say, "To my best friend Scooter..."

JOHN PARKER
You got it.

...the Secretary of Defense, NERVOUSLY CRACKING HIS KNUCKLES...moving 
up the aisle, suddenly screaming:

SCRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell are we doing?!  I don't believe this...what're we waiting 
for?  Christmas?

PROF. HIKITA
(checking his watch)
Ten minutes more.  Buckaroo's orders.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Damn Buckaroo!  I'm the eyes and ears of the President of these United 
States of America!  In loco presidentis!  Which means I'm in charge 
here!

PERFECT TOMMY
Not on this bus, you're not.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Who the hell do you think you are?

PERFECT TOMMY
Perfect Tommy.

That answer alone enough to drive the Secretary up the wall...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well let me tell you something, Mr. Perfect Tommy: I don't need this 
shit.  I could be on Easy Street with a cushy job in the private 
sector.  But instead,  I got me a nine-hundred-million-dollar way-the-
hell-behind-schedule top-secret bomber being built down there by 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and I don't intend to set twiddling thumbs 
in a bus while Buckaroo Banzai goes crashing around my airplane looking 
for his damn girlfriend, driving a car that itself is probably worth 
more to this country than all the tea in China!  I'm talking National 
Security risk and we are going in there like gentlemen and straighten 
this thing out before somebody gets hurt!  You got that?

...the Secretary suddenly grabbing a weapon from a surprised Blue 
Shield and turning it toward the driver...

REVERSE ANGLE...THE SECRETARY CRACKING A SHOT OFF AT THE WINDSHIELD!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Hit it, soldier boy!  Move this buggy!  That's a goddamn executive

Hey, so we get into action quicker this way.  We tell Buckaroo our 
watches were fast.

Ordinary citizen John Parker taking a step toward the Secretary, 
offering him a gas mask...the Secretary turning on him...

That's far enough, black boy...

A mystified John Parker stepping back.

GUARD
It's Bigbooté.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What? Hell, I'll do it yourself if I want it done right, huh?

The Secretary pushing the astonished guards aside and picking up the 
telephone, the guards trying to stop him and in the process turning 
their backs on the bus as it SILENTLY CRUISES PAST THE GATE INTO 
YOYODYNE...

PERFECT TOMMY
Under where?  Hold on...

But John Parker entering a crawl space beneath the huge 
building...Chaparral Team having no choice, following.

EXT.  YOYODYNE GATE - NIGHT	359

The Secretary of Defense struggling with the guards for possession of 
the phone, drawing his stolen weapon...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now you get this straight...you're up to your ass in alligators, and 
I'm here to drain the swamp.  So I'm gonna use this phone...because it 
is all over for you, Baby Blue...
(picking up the phone)
This is the Secretary of Defense at the poorly guarded west gate.  I 
wanna speak to John Bigbooté, person to person.  Okay, okay...Bigbooté.

A FORM suddenly dropping from the ceiling, landing on Perfect Tommy, a 
fierce struggle in the darkness...John Parker to the rescue, garroting

What the hell...that ain't no Truncheon bomber, my friend.  I never 
approved that!

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	368

The Secretary following the speedy John Bigbooté around a bend, unable

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

Bigbooté giving no indication of seeing him, rounding a corner ducking 
into his office...

...the Secretary rounding the corner too but seeing no sign of 
Bigbooté...instead just an office door, a nameplate reading JOHN 
BIGBOOTÉ, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT...the Secretary of Defense opening 
the door...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	369

...moving past a vacant receptionist's desk to John Bigbooté's 
cavernous, strangely furnished chamber...EMPTY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote?!  You can run, but you can't hide.  I want some facts!

...but no sign of John Bigbooté.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	370

Buckaroo and New Jersey still tracking Penny, moving through another 
flooded, slimy corridor we remember...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	371

...the Secretary spying a phone on the receptionist's desk amid 
scattered Oreo cookies, picking the phone up, clicking it a couple of 
times to get a dial tone...totally ignoring AN AMAZING FRAMED PICTURE 
OF A RED ARACHTOID MOTHER AND CHILD ON THE DESK RIGHT IN FRONT OF 
HIM...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Operator...operator...how the hell does a person get an outside line 
around here?

...his gaze now focusing squarely on that cheap framed photograph of 
the RED ARACHTOIDS...Secretary McKinley losing his bearings...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Oh, Lord.  Never mind...forget it...

...his mind reeling, refusing to accept the obvious, the oddly designed 
furniture and chairs in the room, somehow insect-like...a sudden 
sound...a WOMAN'S SCREAM that seems to come from...underneath the 
floor?

...the Secretary cocking his weapon and stepping around the desk as an 
amazing thing occurs...A TRAPDOOR IN THE OFFICE FLOOR opening, the 
Secretary going to investigate, able to observe...

	372
HIS POV of...John O'Connor coming up a ladder and, in the room below, a 
barely conscious Penny still in her private hell, trussed and taped, 
ANTS CRAWLING ON HER ARMS...the lurid specter of John Bigbooté staring 
at her...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	373

PENNY'S CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE UNOPENED ON THE DESK BESIDE HER, as the 
Secretary of Defense suddenly knocks John O'Connor down the ladder and 
jumps into the room, injuring his ankle...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell's is going on here, Bigboote? Where's my bomber? 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
That's 'Bigbooté'.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I don't give a flying handshake what it is! Where's my bomber?

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ 
Let's just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two 
reasonable... 

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Your private life's your own concern, pal.  Where the hell is my 
bomber?  Look at this place...where's your pride?  It's like a pigsty 
down here!

	374
THE TELESCOPING ARM of John Bigbooté suddenly shooting out and lifting 
the Secretary off the floor, banging him into the wall...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It's not my goddamn planet!  Understand, monkey boy!? 

...BIZARRE LAMPS SWAYING as GUNFIRE upstairs prompts Bigbooté to 
release the Secretary, to urge O'Connor to head for a door off the 
hallway...

JOHN O'CONNOR
But John Whorfin said kill her. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Damn John Whorfin--! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	375

Bigbooté and O'Connor emerging in the hallway...seen by Buckaroo Banzai 
and New Jersey as RED ARACHTOIDS...

JOHN PARKER
Look out, Buckaroo Banzai!

Buckaroo turning and just in time, the alien JOHN GOMEZ right behind 
him...and behind Gomez, John Parker and Perfect Tommy with flame 
throwers...

...Buckaroo and New Jersey hitting the deck as the RED ARACHTOID gets 
smoked, the aliens John Bigbooté and John O'Connor escaping in the 
confusion...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	376

The Secretary of Defense still on the floor, spotting the OVERTHRUSTER 
in Penny's purse, taking it just as Buckaroo and New Jersey rush into 
the room...lights swaying...shadows dancing...

...the Secretary struggling to his feet as Buckaroo cuts Penny 
down...spraying her with a white insecticide, New Jersey checking her 
vital signs, Buckaroo shocking New Jersey accidentally with a jolt of 
STATIC ELECTRICITY, as the Secretary slips the OVERTHRUSTER under his 
coat...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(to no one in particular)
It's not over yet...I'll bounce back...always have.  I'll come through 
this thing smelling like a goddamn rose-just watch me.

The Secretary limping out of the room...New Jersey trying to get 
penny's pulse while Buckaroo peels back her eyelids...

NEW JERSEY
Leave her to me. You take care of business. 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Thanks.

Buckaroo looking at New Jersey, knowing he can trust him, rummaging 
through Penny's purse...no Overthruster...

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	377

Dr. Lizardo and the alien John O'Connor and the alien John Bigbooté 
seeing their deteriorating position OVER A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV...VIDEO 
IMAGES OF THE INVADING FORCES...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Sound the call to board ship!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Without the crucial missing circuit?  We'll never make it! 

JOHN O'CONNOR
They are only monkey boys!  We can still crush them here--! 

Lizardo picking up a primitive INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER THE SIZE OF AN 
APPLE CRATE...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You heard my orders!  Activate the Special Horns!

INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	378

Buckaroo joining the alien John Parker, the two of them tearing down 
one of the flooded passages...suddenly covering their ears from those 
PAINFUL, EAR-SPLITTING HORNS!

INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT	379

Secretary of Defense McKinley makes his way through several RED 
ARACHTOIDS running in blind panic...SIRENS WAILING...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Coming through!  Clear it!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	380

...the light of a new day starting to glow through grimy windows...as 
down on the floor, Dr. Lizardo is about to scale a spindly ladder into 
his BIG SUSPENDED SPACESHIP...Lizardo spotting Buckaroo, John Parker 
and Hong Kong Cavaliers entering this sacred space...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Massacre them! Without quarter! 

Dr. Lizardo pushing his own soldiers aside, scurrying into his 
SPACESHIP with John Bigbooté and John O'CONNOR.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	381

no sooner inside than a cowardly order is issued to John O'Connor:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Close the doors! 

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	382

Meanwhile, the floor of the hangar...the alien John Parker using 
strange judo, the amazing Blue Shields fighting like Samurai, ducking 
STINGERS, FIREING into the enemy at point blank range...

	383
BUCKAROO SEEING Dr. Lizardo's engine start up, CLOUDS OF BLACK SMOKE 
pouring from the exhaust pipes...

	384
John Parker fighting his way toward the ship...

	385
WHILE OVER YONDER the Secretary of Defense spots the JET CAR unattended 
amid that field of weird yellow totems...

ANOTHER ANGLE	386

John Parker reaching the BIG SPACESHIP to find Buckaroo already there, 
Buckaroo taking the lead up a tall ladder that seems to reach to a REAR 
ENTRANCE.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	387

Buckaroo settling into a weird little chair, John Parker at his side, 
facing the opposite direction in a love-seat arrangement...at a wall 
cluttered with confusing instruments and a framed photo of LIZARDO...NO 
WAY INTO THE BIG SHIP FROM HERE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is this thing?  A fighter?

JOHN PARKER
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	388

John Bigbooté in the co-pilot's seat, as Doctor Lizardo attempts to 
connect his clumsy overthruster.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Overthruster in place. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It won't work! It won't! 

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Shut up, John Bigboote, you coward! 

John O'Connor pushing John Bigbooté aside as Lizardo hits another 
switch and for a fraction of a second ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE, A BLINDING 
GREEN LIGHT!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	389

The spacecraft lurches forward twelve feet!  Stops.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	390

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Again, John O'Connor!  Again!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	391

...AS WITHOUT WARNING LIZARDO'S BIG SHIP LURCHES AGAIN LIKE A TETHERED 
BEAST!

ANGLE ON THE WALL PULSING!	392

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	393

BUCKAROO BANZAI
They haven't got enough power.  They'll never penetrate!

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	394

Dr. Lizardo, a raging madman in the cockpit, using a RADIO MIKE:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Almost!  Almost!  Lower my vehicle onto the runway!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No!  Please!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	395

THE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT, TRAPPING THEM...

JOHN PARKER
We're going down!  Onto the runway!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The door's locked.

INT.  JET CAR/LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	396

Meanwhile, unnoticed, Secretary of Defense John McKinley reaches the 
JET CAR, starts to climb in...

SMALL VOICE
Another step, I'll drink your blood--!

The Secretary turning, not seeing anyone at first...then little Scooter 
Lindley with an M-14 trained on him...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Get 'em up!

Scooter means business...as he suddenly demonstrates, blowing away an 
oncoming ARACHTOID before turning the gun back on the Secretary, who 
raises his hands...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
What's that?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Can opener...just a...

Scooter taking the CURIOUS OBJECT from his prisoner, not fooled for a 
second.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	397

AWFUL THUMPING VIBRARIONS as John O'Connor hits the Overthruster switch 
again!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGER - DAWN	398

THE HANGER WALL BEGINNING TO OOZE...GLOWING.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	399

Dr. Lizardo and John O'Connor ecstatic...John Bigbooté terrified...

INT.  THEMOPOD - DAWN	400

Buckaroo and John Parker rattling in their seats!  No escape...

INT.  HANGER WALL - DAWN	401

The sudden "expulsion" by the wall of a TWEEDY, FLESHY OBJECT 
RESEMBLING A LUMP OF CLAY which rapidly begins to define itself as the 
real, 1938-MODEL BLACK-HAIRED DOCTOR LIZARDO, standing in total 
bewilderment, SEVERAL 15th CENTURY BUCCANEERS spit out next, equally 
disoriented...

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	402

The "other Lizardo" (Whorfin) meanwhile undergoing a painful reverse 
transformation: FROM OLD MAN BACK TO RED ARACHTOID!  HIS EYES 
GLOWING...LIGHT ENERGY GLOWING INSIDE HIS MOUTH!

JOHN WHORFIN (LIZARDO)
Full speed ahead!

JOHN BIGTOOTE
We haven't a chance.  Your Overthruster's for shit!  We'll all just...

JOHN WHORFIN
One more word out of you, Bigboote...

JOHN BIGTOOTE
Bigbooté.

WHORFIN'S ARM ELONGATING, FLASHING OUT, breaking John Bigbooté's neck!  
John O'Connor moving up a notch at Yoyodyne.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	403

Buckaroo and John Parker picking up all of Whorfin's intraship 
communications...

WHORFIN'S VOICE
Full speed ahead!  Battle stations!

	404
THEIR POV OF THE HANGER AREA:  nightmarish excitement down below!  The 
floor rushing up as...

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	405

The BIG SPACESHIP makes violent contact with its runway, rocketing 
ahead!

	406
THE COCKPIT POV AS THE SHIP RUSHES TOWARD THE WALL...the real Doctor 
Emillio Lizardo barely ducking out of the way!  Buccaneers scattering!

EXT.  HANGAR WALL/YOYODYNE - DAWN	407

THE BIG SPACESHIP CRASHING THROUGH THE HANGAR WALL, clumsy, heavy...

	408
REVERSE ANGLE...WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP lifting off into the dark 
morning sky, taking Buckaroo and John Parker with it on its WOBBLY, 
UNCERTAIN FLIGHT...BANKING VIOLENTLY...

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	409

The crew of BLACK ARACHTOIDS aboard the ethereal father ship also at 
their battle stations...

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Banzai has failed!  John Whorfin is airborne!

BLACK ARACHTOID OFFICER
but not in the Eighth Dimension.  Shouldn't we wait?  Maybe John 
Parker-

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
I have my order from John Emdall!  8000 miles.  Mark.  Activate 
particle beam.  Lock on Smolensk.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	410

John Parker fiddling with a RADIO, homing in on the black ship's 
frequency, overhearing:

BLACK ARACHTOID CHATTER
Particle beam activated...lock on Smolensk...one minute to rapid 
rupture...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell them to stop.  They're your friends!

JOHN PARKER
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!

John Parker talking to the father ship as Buckaroo struggles to unlock 
the strange little saucer from Whorfin's big vehicle.

	411
BUCKAROO'S POV (SIDE OF SHIP)...THE PROBLEM.  A SERIES OF ODD SUCTION 
DEVICES outside holding the thermopod in place.

	412
CLOSE ON DASHBOARD.  Buckaroo finally finding the proper release 
switch!

EXT.  WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	413

CLOSE ON the SUCTION BOLTS disengaging!  Freeing the small craft!

EXT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	414

His vehicle falling sideways, John Parker trying to ignite its ENGINES!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	415

In a free fall, the engines finally igniting and the thermopod 
rocketing upward!

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	416

BLACK ARACHTOID OFFICER
Sir, a thermopod has peeled off from Whorfin's ship!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
So what?  Big deal.  Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

INT. THERMOPOD - DAWN	417

Buckaroo struggling to master the strange craft...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?

JOHN PARKER
Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

John Parker trying a likely button.

	418
ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD...ACTIVATING THE OVERTHRUSTER BEAM WHICH 
BLASTS OUT HARMLESSLY INTO THE MORNING SKY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.

EXT.  SUBURBAN SKIES - DAWN	419

SPACESHIPS THUNDER over the lights of the awakening city below...

INT.  THEMOPOD - DAWN	420

BLACK ARACHTOID CHATTER
(over radio)
Twenty seconds to rapid rupture.  Two zero.  Prepare the heat shields!

Time running out...Buckaroo receiving fire from Whorfin's big 
spaceship, THE SMALL VEHICLE LURCHING...THE TWO VEHICLES ON A COLLISION 
COURSE!

EXT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	421

The little ship dropping like a stone, barely avoiding a head-on with 
Whorfin and company!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	422

Buckaroo unhappy with John Parker's marksmanship...their "love seat" 
rotating, reversing their functions...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Take the throttle, John Parker!

INT.  WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	423

John Whorfin and John O'Connor scrambling into evasive action, but it's 
too late.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	424

Buckaroo Banzai and John Parker diving toward them, their OVERTHRUSTER 
FIRING!  FIRING!

INT.  WHORFIN'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	425

Whorfin shaking his RED FIST in defiance...

JOHN WHORFIN
Banzai!  I'll see you in hell!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	426

FLYING ON A COLLISION COURSE once again, THE OVERTHRUSTER BEAM FINALLY 
HITTING HOME AND THE BIG SPACESHIP DISINTEGRATING, VAPORIZING...John 
Whorfin and his ilk history...

	427
REVERSE ANGLE ON John Parker...still on a collision course with the 
GIANT BALL OF HOT VAPOR THAT WAS LORD WHORFIN...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!

JOHN PARKER
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Now!

EXT.  YOYODYNE - DAWN	428

As the Cavaliers and Blue Shields anxiously watch, THE SKY CRACKLES AND 
THE CLOUDS GLOW!

INT.  FATHER SHIP - DAWN	429

BLACK ARACHTOID RADAR
John Whorfin destroyed!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Deactivate particle beam!  Tracking zero zero zero!

EXT.  SKY - DAWN	430

The sun coming up...and as we wonder what terrible fate has befallen 
Buckaroo Banzai and John Parker...A TINY FIGURE APPEARS high in the 
clouds!  A BIZARRE PARACHUTE catching the wind, floating lazily to 
earth.

	431
CLOSER SHOT: Buckaroo!  Safe and sound, looking up and SALUTING John 
Parker as the little THERMOPOD flip-flops, tumbles heavenward AT AN 
INCREDIBLE RATE OF SPEED...heading home.

EXT.  YOYODYNE - DAWN	432

Buckaroo touching down...Professor Hikita among the victorious Blue 
Shields scarcely able to believe his eyes as he spots...no, it can't 
be...rising from the debris...

PROF. HIKITA
Emilio!

Now it's the young Doctor Lizardo's turn to stare incredulously...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Toichi--?  I'll be damned.

The two scientists approaching one another...afraid to touch as if the 
other might prove a mirage...

	433
RENO FINDING A CUTLASS ON THE GROUND...as Buckaroo, face blackened with 
soot, his clothing torn, hurries toward several Blue Shields (gas masks 
off) herding a half-dozen "HUMAN" PRISONERS while other Shields and 
Cavaliers share congratulatory handshakes...RED STINGERS still stuck in 
their bullet-proof vests...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?

PERFECT TOMMY
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy 
if you want my opinion.

Perfect Tommy and Reno pacing Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Got a casualty list?

RENO
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're 
illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could 
throw the book at 'em...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back 
to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't 
in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and 
inside out...

Perfect Tommy whistling...

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, Scooter Lindley, fall in!

Scooter's eyes lighting up as he runs over...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Is this what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

The Oscillation Overthruster, safe and sound.  Buckaroo amazed, 
receiving the precious object, giving Scooter a Blue Shield 
salute...the Secretary of Defense watching jealously from a short 
distance, his clothing disheveled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Looks like one Junior Shield is in line for a ride in The Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!
(suddenly crestfallen)
I'll have to ask my dad.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Well, go ahead, what're you waiting for?

Scooter running off.

	434
A dour-faced, shaken New Jersey appears in the doorway of the big bus, 
Buckaroo's smile immediately vanishing...

NEW JERSEY
I did all I could.  I did my best...

Buckaroo racing past new Jersey and into the bus...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUT - DAWN	435

Buckaroo hurrying through the front section.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAWN	436

Buckaroo hurrying through the COMMUNICATIONS NERVE CENTER...

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Buckaroo, Reno said check with you - something about "pirates"?  He 
mean the baseball team?

No response.

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Buckaroo, the President's on line on.  Calling about is everything okay 
with the alien space cloud and Planet Ten...or should he just go ahead 
and destroy Russia...? 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell him yes on "1" and no on "2". 

Buckaroo going into his PRIVATE REAR SECTION of the bus...

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Which was "yes"? Destroy Russia? Or "2"...?

INT. BEDROOM/BUS - DAWN	437

Buckaroo reaching his private quarters, finding Penny on his cot, a 
sheet pulled over her face...ethereal morning light caressing her still 
body...

...Buckaroo distraught, pulling the sheet back to reveal Penny in final 
repose, speckled with dead ants, honey and powdery white insecticide... 
Buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish.

	438
His lips moving toward hers...when suddenly a SPARK LEAPS OUT, ARCING 
FROM THE TIP OF BUCKAROO'S NOSE TO THE TIP OF PENNY'S!

	439
And she stirs...a faint nerve response, Buckaroo seizing her with both 
hands...SPARKS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny!

...shaking her, exhorting her...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open your eyes!  Look at me!  Penny!

...but nothing, no more signs of life...

	440
...Buckaroo kissing her in despair, pressing his lips against her 
lips...the kiss of the century, A POWERFUL ELECTRIC JOLT!

	441
...the fire of life as Penny opens her eyes, sees her haggard hero 
before her.

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo...you look awful.

	442
And indeed they both do, but who cares?  ANOTHER GALVANIC KISS, 
CRACKLING GOOD as the tiny bedroom heats up and we do the decent 
thing...IRIS OUT...as CREDITS ROLL and the FANTASTIC VOICE OF Dr. 
Buckaroo Banzai serenades us home...

...the Hong Kong Cavaliers harmonizing like honey, the world once again 
a safe, snug harbor.

          only.  He hacks an opening, bats fly out AT CAMERA and the

          INT. MISSION CONTROL
          
          The CONTROLLER moves away from his video unit.  A kid from
          the tour who has lagged behind hits a switch.  The screen
          turns into a video game with SFX.  He flips knobs.
          
          
          INT. LUNAR SHUTTLE
          
          The crew are tossed from side to side and try to regain
          control of the ship.
          
          
          EXT. NIGHT SKY
          
          The Lunar shuttle careens towards the terminal, out of
          control.
          
          
          INT. CONTROL ROOM
          
          The kid is still playing like mad.  A flash appears on the
          screen.  SFX VIDEO GAME EXPLOSION and a corresponding
          EXPLOSION from outside.  SIRENS WAIL.  CONTROLLERS run
          around.  The kid is oblivious and walks away.
          
          
          EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT
          
          BUD KRUGER, head of the space center, and the COMMISSIONER
          get out of a limo under a sign that reads, "MERCURY
          SHUTTLE."  They walk and talk.
          
                                  KRUGER
                   Commissioner, we both know the Mercury
                   shuttle needs another month of pre-launch
                   testing.
          
                                  COMMISSIONER
                   Forget it.  The boys on the board want
                   that shuttle to go on schedule.

                   And what do the boys on the board know
                   about safety, Commissioner?  Let me talk
                   to them.
          
                                  COMMISSIONER
                   Bud, get wise to the political realities.
                   The boys on the board are under a lot of
                   pressure from the boys downtown.

                   And I'll be the one they'll hang if
                   there's a screw-up.

          PLANT MELTDOWN, 500 WORKERS SERIOUSLY TANNED" -- and doesn't
          notice his shoes are getting black polish.
          
                                  COMMISSIONER
                   Listen, Bud, the boys downtown are under
                   heavy fire from the boys in Washington.
                   That's why they're putting pressure on the
                   boys on the board.

                   Well, you tell the boys on the board to
                   tell the boys downtown to let the boys in
                   Washington know that the press has been
                   nosing around my people in the front

                   handle the press and leave the boys in
                   Washington to the boys downtown and the

          Simon and Elaine are approached by a BUSINESSMAN with
          handful of roses.
          
                                  BUSINESSMAN
                   Would you like to buy a rose to help bail
                   out Chrysler?  We're an all-profit
                   organization and need all the money we can
                   get.
          
          Simon hands the Businessman a dollar and takes a rose.

          Simon hands Elaine the rose.  She takes his arm as they walk
          towards the sign that reads, "MERCURY SHUTTLE."
          
                                  SIMON
                   For the best little computer officer on

                   Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was
                   once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago
                   run.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged
                   to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very
                   lucky woman.
          
          A man with a suitcase on a leash walks beside them.  The
          case pulls him along like a dog and takes a leak on a post.

                   Women and the space program have come a
                   long way, sweetheart.  But after the
                   wedding, no more complicated computers for
                   my little girl.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   But, darling, they've offered me a chance
                   to head up the computer analysis division
                   for the Jupiter probe.
          
                                  SIMON
                   You're heading up the division in charge
                   of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
          
          He kisses Elaine and smiles.

                   And that's an order, Lieutenant.
          
          The man with the case on a leash passes a woman with a case
          on a leash.  The cases start a violent, BARKING DOG FIGHT.

          undone, with a huge cigar, which he eats during the
          conversation, talks to his wife on his car phone.  A worker

                   We've got a condition red with our
                   marriage.  I think you're in love with
                   that shuttle, not with me.  I want a
                   divorce, Sarg.

          Sarg throws the lit match towards the "ABSOLUTELY NO
          SMOKING" sign.  The worker grimaces but nothing happens.
          
                                  MARGE
                   Sarg, there's been someone else for
                   fifteen years.  You were just too involved
                   in your work to see it.
          
          They hang up.  Sarg bites off the end of his cigar and spits
          it in the direction of the "NO SPITTING" sign, blowing the
          worker OUT OF FRAME with a MASSIVE EXPLOSION.  Sarg hops
          into his car, takes a Lava lamp from the seat and puts it on
          the car roof -- like Kojak's flasher.  The lamp flashes, the
          SIREN WAILS, as Sarg pulls away.

          football players -- other half-clad athletes (hockey,
          baseball, wrestling, basketball) line up for their turn at
          her.  Sarg has to climb over them to kiss her goodbye.
          
                                  SARG
                   Don't wait up for me, sweetheart.  We're

                   You just can't see it, can you, Sarg.
          
                                  SARG
                   We'll talk tomorrow, hon.  I promise.

                   just have to be locked up with the
                   luggage.
          
          The man in the cage seems to relish the latter suggestion.

          Jimmy's dog.

          outfits.
          
                                  JACOBS
                   Sir, these are the designs for the flight
                   uniforms.  I think the captain's is to
                   die.

                   Good, good, no, no, good.  What's this?!
                   I said no studded dog collars, Jacobs.
          
          Jacobs grabs the drawings and leaves in a huff.

          Ted turns to leave and bumps right into Elaine.  She holds
          him.

          In b.g. a car is parked by a huge rocket engine.  A worker
          opens the hood and strings jumper cables to the rocket.  A
          sign above rocket reads, "ROCKET ENGINE TEST AREA."
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted, you're overworked.  You've been
                   flying yourself into the ground.

                   Let's relax tonight, just the two of us.
                   I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the
                   way you like it, with spaghetti.

          Simon signals the guards.  They grab Ted.  He struggles and
          rants.  A DOCTOR in white approaches and injects something
          into Ted's arm.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   No!  Wait!  You're hurting him!
          
          Ted falls unconscious.  Simon holds Elaine.
          
                                  SIMON
                   Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a
                   threat to this mission and his behavior
                   does absolutely nothing to promote peace
                   in the Middle East.

                   So mentally ill?
          
          Elaine collapses on Simon's shoulder, sobbing.  Simon smiles
          evilly.  The technician with the jumper cables, b.g.,
          signals the driver to start the car.  The car revs and the
          rocket fires.

                   Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you.
                   But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a
                   good provider.  I want that at this stage
                   of the game, Ted.  He might have his
                   faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning
                   of the word fear and I need that in a man.

          Ted pushes through crowd and passes a spherical booth with
          sign that reads, "ORGASMIC EXPERIENCES, 25¢."  MRS. GOOCH,
          an elderly woman, stops Ted next to the booth door.
          
                                  MRS. GOOCH
                   Young man, would you have change for a
                   twenty?
          
                                  TED

                   I might have two tens.
          
                                  MRS. GOOCH
                   Thank you anyway, but I wanted it in
                   quarters.
          
          Ted keeps moving past a police line which has gone up around
          Frank Morgan's body.  We HOLD on the murder scene.  A
          DETECTIVE kneels beside the body which now has a chalk mark
          around it.

                                  DETECTIVE HALLICK
                   Senseless or not, Sergeant, there's a
                   pattern here.  This is the 12th victim
                   this week with a chalk mark around the
                   body.  I want this whole area cordoned
                   off!  I want everyone in this terminal
                   booked and beaten until they talk.  I want
                   an M.O. on everyone who has seen THE SOUND
                   OF MUSIC and I want the entire population
                   of Hawaii off that rock and into the water
                   within one hour.
          
          Hallick stands up and finds the area surrounded by 30
          accordian players playing "Lady of Spain."
          
                                  DETECTIVE HALLICK
                   Sergeant.  I said cordon off, not
                   accordian off!  Now dust this area for
                   prints.
          
          One cop pulls out a duster and dusts the wall.  Other cops
          follow after him hanging prints by Picasso, Lautrec, etc.
          
                                  DETECTIVE HALLICK
                   And run a check on their plates.
          
          A cop looks at people's upper false teeth plates.

          A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER straddles the body and shoots it
          "BLOW-UP" style.

                                  COMMISSIONER
                   That just doesn't make any sense.

                   I wonder how your boys in Washington are
                   going to take this one.

                                  KRUGER
                   You've made your point, Commissioner.
                   There's only one other pilot who can
                   handle that shuttle and that's Clarence
                   Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I
                   want him pulled.

          He runs out.

                   little nervous about Oveur's record.
          
          The Commissioner throws an album on Kruger's desk.  On the
          cover is a photo of Oveur with an accordian.  The title

          Ted, tied in chair, watches the cigarette roll up to some
          oil rags.  They burst into flame.  The flames lap up against
          a yellow oil drum labeled "EXPLOSIVE."  PAN to three more
          drums labeled, "DYNAMIC!", "BRILLIANT!", "A MUST SEE!".
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL OUTSIDE STORAGE ROOM
          
          EDITH and DAVE WALTERS, a middle-aged couple, carry their
          hand luggage.  Edith appears very nervous.
          
                                  DAVE
                   I'm telling you, Edith, space travel is
                   safer than driving a car.
          
          The storage room door EXPLODES open in front of them.  Ted
          flies out with the debris.  Edith faints.  Ted gets up,
          brushes himself off and heads to the ticket counter just as
          the ticket agent flips a sign over that reads, "MERCURY --
          SOLD OUT."  Ted spots a SCALPER and reaches for his wallet.
          
                                  SCALPER
                   Mercury seats.  I got a pair.  I got aisle
                   seats, window seats.  Check 'em out.
          
          
          INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT - MORNING
          
          Computerized panels line all walls.  Windows are similar to
          an airplane -- outside carwash brushes soap down the nose.
          The "HOT WAX" sign flashes.  Two attendants wipe windows
          with soap gloves and move to the DISTANT STRAINS of "CAR
          WASH."  Elaine sits at computer, two other CREW are in their
          seats.  Simon enters with Oveur.
          
                                  SIMON
                   Gentlemen, this is Captain Oveur.  He's
                   taking over for Frank Morgan.
          
                                  MR. UNGER
                   What's the problem?
          
                                  SIMON
                   Morgan was senselessly murdered about an
                   hour ago.
          
          Elaine gasps.

                        (black, sports afro)
                   Murdered?  I hope it's not serious.
          
                                  SIMON
                   We won't know until after the autopsy.
          
                                  MR. DUNN
                   Of course.  Welcome aboard, sir.

                                  SIMON
                   Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger,
                   and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.

          INT. TERMINAL SECURITY CHECK AREA - "MERCURY GATE"
          
          The Terrorists still seem confused as to where they're
          going.  They pass through the security metal detector, guns
          raised above their heads.  A GUARD runs a hand-held metal
          detector up and down their bodies.  At the same time, Mrs.
          Gooch is being held spread-eagle against the wall.  One
          Guard holds a gun to her head, another frisks her.  Ted
          moves through behind the Terrorists.

          A young boy passes through the X-ray tunnel.  His dental
          chart appears on the screen.  A DENTIST at the other end
          stops him and looks in his mouth.

          A car wash attendant opens a side door to the cockpit and
          enters in headphones, moving to "CAR WASH," with a vacuum.
          He cleans the floor and an ashtray and finds a baseball
          behind the Captain's seat which he pockets.

                   diversions of bourgeois liberals,

          Dr. Rumack and Elaine walk across the well-groomed lawn.
          Elaine carries a box of spaghetti-to-go.  As they walk, they
          pass patients in wheelchairs pushed by nurses.  The further
          they walk, the more wheelchairs appear until the lawn is
          jammed with two hundred wheelchairs bumping into each other,
          patients falling out, total wheelchair chaos.
          
                                  ELAINE

                   The human brain is a highly complex organ,
                   Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to
                   the bladder.

                   So you see, our task isn't made any easier
                   by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   What can I do, Doctor Rumack?
          
          He stops next to a sign, "HOSPITAL GARDEN."
          
                                  RUMACK

                                  RUMACK
                   You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's
                   been working out a lot of his aggressions
                   here in the garden.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Is that a good sign, Doctor?
          
          Rumack holds the "HOSPITAL GARDEN" sign.
          
                                  RUMACK
                   It does the job.
          
          
          ANGLE ON TED
          
          He is ripping up small trees, shrubs, etc., and throwing
          them onto a huge pile of mud that resembles the mountain
          that Dreyfuss built in "Close Encounters."

                   Hello, Ted.
          
          Ted ignores her as he works frantically.

                   I brought you some spaghetti.
          
          Ted still ignores her as he works feverishly.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   What are you doing, Ted?

          Ted scurries around.

          He ignores her.  Rumack walks up and puts an arm around her
          shoulder.  Elaine starts to sob.

                   these stress pills.
          
          Stella hands him a pill which he pops automatically, but
          misses his face with his drink.  She leaves the bottle next
          to Ted.  ZOOM on bottle.

                   Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious
                   you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman.
                   I can relate to that.

                   What about tonight -- just you and me.  We
                   can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone
                   else on the ship -- I've already proven

                   please tell my wife that there is nothing
                   that can go wrong.  I think she'd like to
                   hear it from you.
          
          Testa spots Dunn's tattered sleeve emerge from the washroom
          door, groping for a handhold.  She screams and dumps coffee
          in Edith's face.  She runs to help Dunn, grabs his sleeve.
          It comes off in her hands.  She keeps pulling.  His jacket
          comes off, his pants, underwear, socks, an entire
          clothesline of garments like bras, towels, etc.  She hears a
          SCREAM.  Then silence.

          INT. COCKPIT
          
          Simon is taking another slug of booze; Elaine enters.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Simon!
                        (she spots Oveur slumped on the
                         panel)
                   Captain Oveur!
          
          Elaine pulls him up.
          
                                  OVEUR
                        (still gasping)
                   Mets... nine... Phils... three... Cubs...
                   four...
          
          Elaine drops him and turns to Simon.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Simon, what's happening?!
          
                                  SIMON
                   He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed
                   him.  That computer is running this ship
                   and we're heading right for the sun.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Can't we change course?
          
                                  SIMON
                   We're computer locked and the manual
                   navigation unit is down.
          
          Elaine looks at the floor.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Then Ted was right!

                                  SIMON
                   My career is shot.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Your career!  What about the lives of
                   those people out there.  Simon, what
                   happened to the man I thought I loved?
          
          She goes to the door.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I've got to get Ted.  Just don't come
                   apart on me now, Simon.
          
          She leaves.  Simon's uniform starts bursting at the seams,
          buttons pop off.
          
          
          INT. CABIN
          
          The Terrorists stop Elaine.  There's pandemonium in the
          cabin.
          
                                  TERRORIST 1
                   This is flight to Miami, yes?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   No.
          
          Elaine addresses the PASSENGERS.
          
                                  ELAINE

                   Please, ladies and gentlemen, please calm
                   down.  Listen to me!
          
          They calm down.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   We've been thrown off course just a tad.
          
                                  PASSENGER
                   What's that mean?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   In space terms, about 70 million miles.
          
          The Passengers appear interested and sensible, nod their
          heads.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   The bumps you feel are car-sized asteroids
                   smashing into the hull.
          
          The hood of a car smashes through the cabin wall.  The
          Passengers still appear interested and sensible.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Also, we're heading right for the sun and
                   can't seem to change course.
          
          Passengers still appear interested and sensible.  They all
          put on sunglasses.
          
                                  PASSENGER
                   Are you telling us everything?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Not exactly.  We're also out of coffee.
          
          The Passengers errupt in total panic.

                   But Father, I'm not Catholic.
          
                                  O'FLANAGAN
                   Then worship the god of your choice.

                   unfaithful just once.  Remember Jill, my
                   first secretary?  Forgive me.
          
                                  MARY-JANE
                   I knew all about it.  I was unfaithful
                   once, too.
          
                                  BOB
                   That's all behind us now.

          McCrosky bursts through the doors and heads to the monitors.
          He wears a raincoat and shirt and tie.  He is met by
          Controller 1.  They move across room.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   Get me a cup of coffee, mister.
          
                                  CONTROLLER 1

                   Yes, sir! Welcome home, sir!
          
          McCrosky takes off his raincoat revealing scuba tank.  He
          takes off his tank as well.

          Another Controller passes.  McCrosky stops him.

                   First the earth cooled.  Then the
                   dinosaurs came but were too big and died
                   and everything got rotten and turned into
                   oil and the Arabs bought Mercedes Benzs
                   and then there was the best TV special on
                   Judy Garland.  Then we lost the war with
                   Albania.  Then...
          
          McCrosky leaves Jacobs babbling.

                   Things sure haven't changed.
          
          McCrosky stands in front of a huge painting of himself.
          Both he and painting are in the same pose -- one hand
          loosens the tie, he drinks coffee with the other, a

                   couldn't do it.  But when the going got
                   tough that kid pulled it together.

                   Kramer, the WORP control handle just came
                   off in my hand.

                   I'd give my right arm to get just one of
                   these buttons or levers up there right
                   now.
                        (on radio)
                   Okay, Striker.  You're going to have to
                   pull that lever panel off.

          She hands him a vodka and orange juice.  Ted throws it on
          his face.  He reaches down and rips the panel off, exposing
          all sorts of wires.

                   Now find a piece of metal and stick it in
                   there.
          
          Ted looks around for a piece of metal.  Elaine pulls a bobby
          pin from her hair.

                   Will this work, Ted?
          
          Her long brown hair falls sexily.  She sweeps it back with a
          toss of her head.  Ted is overwhelmed by her.

                              SYNOPSIS

     En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the
     starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language,
     originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.

     Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange
     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.

     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-
     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and
     cannot be removed.

     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing
     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not
     kill it on the ship.

     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,
     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been
     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose
     on the ship.

     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears
     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's
     bizarre life cycle.

     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the
     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a
     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which
     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

     FADE IN:

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital
     displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future.

     Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic
     machinery chuckles softly to itself.

     Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken.
     Circuits close, lights blink on.

     CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the
     machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal:

     INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT

     A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with
     instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid.

     Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER
     COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers.

     FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the
     freezers pop open.

     Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.

                              ROBY
               Oh... God... am I cold... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Is that you, Roby?

                              ROBY
               I feel like shit... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, it's you all right.

     Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.

                              FAUST
                    (groans)
               Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead.

                              BROUSSARD
               You look dead.

                              MELKONIS
               The vampires rise from their graves.

     This draws a few woozy chuckles.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (shakes his fist in the
                     air triumphantly)
               We made it!

                              HUNTER
                    (not fully awake)
               Is it over?

                              STANDARD
               It's over, Hunter.

                              HUNTER
                    (yawning)
               Boy, that's terrific.

                              STANDARD
                    (looking around with a grin)
               Well, how does it feel to be rich
               men?

                              FAUST
               Cold!

     This draws a LAUGH.

                              STANDARD
               Okay!  Everybody topside!  Let's get
               our pants on and get to our posts!

     The men begin to swing out of the freezers.

                              MELKONIS
               Somebody get the cat.

     Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

     This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation.  There
     are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by
     viewscreens, all blank for the moment.

     There are seats for four men.  Each chair faces a console and is
     surrounded by a dazzling array of technology.

     STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding their
     seats.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.

                              ROBY
                    (putting down the cat)
               Cattle ranch!

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm not kidding.  You can get one if
               you have the credit.  Look just like
               real cows, too.

                              STANDARD
               All right, tycoons, let's stop
               spending our credit and start
               worrying about the job at hand.

                              ROBY
               Right.  Fire up all systems.

     They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles.  The control
     room starts to come to life.  All around the room, colored lights
     flicker and chase each other across glowing screens.  The room fills
     with the hum and chatter of machinery.

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, you want to give us some
               vision?

                              MELKONIS
               Feast your eyes.

     Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches.  The
     strip of viewscreens flickers into life.

     On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (after a pause)
               Where's Irth?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, scan the whole sky.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  On the screens the images all begin to pan.

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a
     starfield.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.  This camera is remote controlled,
     turning silently on its base.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted on
     the HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT.

     When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP
     "SNARK," hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a
     background of glimmering stars.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, contact traffic control.

     Melkonis switches on his radio unit.

                              MELKONIS
               This is deep space commercial vessel
               SNARK, registration number E180246,
               calling Antarctica air traffic
               control.  Do you read me?  Over.

     There is only the HISS OF STATIC.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (staring at a screen)
               I don't recognize that constellation.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, plot our location.

     Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               I got it.  Oh boy.

                              STANDARD
               Where the hell are we?

                              BROUSSARD
               Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We
               haven't even reached the outer rim
               yet.

                              ROBY
               What the hell?

     Standard picks up a microphone.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we
               are not home.  Our present location
               seems to be only halfway to Irth.
               Remain at your posts and stand by.
               That is all.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, I've got something here on my
               security alert.  A high priority from
               the computer... 

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons)
               Computer, you have signalled a
               priority three message.  What is the
               message?

                              COMPUTER
                    (a mechanical voice)
               I have interrupted the course of the
               voyage.

                              ROBY
               What?  Why?

                              COMPUTER
               I am programmed to do so if certain
               conditions arise.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, this is Captain Standard.
               What conditions are you talking
               about?

                              COMPUTER
               I have intercepted a transmission of
               unknown origin.

                              STANDARD
               A transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               A voice transmission.

                              MELKONIS
               Out here?

     The men exchange glances.

                              COMPUTER
               I have recorded the transmission.

                              STANDARD
               Play it for us, please.

     Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A
     STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN
     LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls
     silent.

     The men all stare at each other in amazement.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what language was that?

                              COMPUTER
               Unknown.

                              ROBY
               Unknown!  What do you mean?

                              COMPUTER
               It is none of the 678 dialects
               spoken by technological man.

     There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.

                              STANDARD
                    (silencing them)
               Just hold it, hold it!
                    (glares around the room)
               Computer: have you attempted to
               analyze the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               Yes.  There are two points of salient
               interest.  Number one: it is highly
               systematized, indicating intelligent
               origin.  Number two: certain sounds
               are inconsistent with the human
               palate.

                              ROBY
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Well, it's finally happened.

                              MELKONIS
               First contact... 

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, can you home in on that beam?

                              MELKONIS
               What's the frequency?

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what's the frequency of
               the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               65330 dash 99.

     Melkonis punches buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got it.  It's coming from
               ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds,
               declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

                              STANDARD
               Dell -- show me that on a screen.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll give it to you on number four.

     Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a
     small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               That's it.  Let me straighten it out.

     He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in
     the center.

                              STANDARD
               Can you get it a little closer?

                              BROUSSARD
               That's what I'm going to do.

     He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers.

                              MELKONIS
               It's tiny!

                              STANDARD
               Any rotation?

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah.  Two hours.

                              STANDARD
               Gravity?

                              BROUSSARD
               Point eight six.  We can walk on it.

     Standard rises.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, get the others up to the
               lounge.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and
     FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.

                              MELKONIS
               If it's an S.O.S., we're morally
               obligated to investigate.

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

                              HUNTER
               I don't know.  Seems to me we came on
               this trip to make some credit, not
               to go off on some kind of side trip.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (excited)
               Forget the credit; what we have here
               is a chance to be the first men to
               contact a nonhuman intelligence.

                              ROBY
               If there is some kind of alien
               intelligence down on that planetoid,
               it'd be a serious mistake for us to
               blunder in unequipped.

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, we're equipped --

                              ROBY
               Hell, no!  We don't know what's down
               there on that piece of rock!  It
               might be dangerous!  What we should
               do is get on the radio to the
               exploration authorities... and let
               them deal with it.

               Except it will take 75 years to get
               a reply back.  Don't forget how far
               we are from the Colonies, Martin.

                              BROUSSARD
               There are no commercial lanes out
               here.  Face it, we're out of range.

                              MELKONIS
               Men have waited centuries to contact
               another form of intelligent life in
               the universe.  This is an opportunity
               which may never come again.

                              ROBY
               Look --

                              STANDARD
               You're overruled, Martin.  Gentlemen
               -- let's go.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, I want greater magnification.
               More surface detail.  I want to see
               what this place looks like.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll see what I can do.

     He jabs his controls.  The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD THE
     PLANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.

                              STANDARD
               It's out of focus.

                              ROBY
               No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud
               layer.

                              MELKONIS
               My God, it's stormy for a piece of
               rock that size!

                              ROBY
               Just a second.
                    (punches buttons)
               Those aren't water vapor clouds;
               they have no moisture content.

                              STANDARD
               Put ship in atmospheric mode.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - OUTER SPACE

     The great dish antenna on the SNARK folds down against the main body
     of the ship, and other parts flatten out, until the ship has assumed
     an aerodynamic form.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Dell, set a course and bring us in
               on that beam.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK's engines cough into life, and send it drifting toward the
     distant dot that is the planetoid.

     CAMERA APPROACHES THE PLANETOID, until it looms large on screen.  It is
     turbulent, completely enveloped in dun-colored clouds.

     The SNARK drops down toward the surface.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Activate lifter quads.

                     studies his instruments)
               Crossing the terminator.  Entering
               night side.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - IN ORBIT

     Beneath the orbiting SNARK, night's curtain rolls across the planet.

     Descending at an angle, the SNARK drops down into the thick atmosphere
     of the planetoid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.

                              STANDARD
               Turn on navigation lights.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK"

     Hydroplaning down through the pea-soup atmosphere, a set of brilliant
     lights switches on, cutting through the dust, but hardly improving
     visibility.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

               Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are
               directly above the source of the

                              STANDARD
               What's the terrain down there?

                              BROUSSARD
               Well, line of sight is impossible
               due to dust.  Radar gives me noise.
               Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared --
               noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There.
               Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.

                              STANDARD
               Is it solid?

                              BROUSSARD
               It's... basalt.  Rock.

                              STANDARD
               Then take her down.

                              BROUSSARD
               Drop begins... now!  Fifteen
               kilometers and dropping... twelve... 
               ten... eight and slowing.  Five.
               Three.  Two.  One kilometer and
               slowing.  Lock tractor beams.

     There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders.

                              ROBY
               Locked.

                              BROUSSARD
               Kill drive engines.

     The engines fall silent.

               Engines off.

                              BROUSSARD
               Nine hundred meters and dropping.
               800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers
     above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.

     Landing struts unfold like insect legs.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               And we're... down.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the
     panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT.

                              BROUSSARD
               Jesus Christ!

     The lights come back on again.

                              STANDARD
               What the hell happened?

                              ROBY
                    (hits a switch)
               Engine room, what happened?

                    (over, filtered)
               Just a minute, hold it, I'm
               checking.

                              ROBY
               Has the hull been breached?

                              BROUSSARD
               Uh... 
                    (scans his gauges)
               No, I don't see anything.  We've
               still got pressure.

     There is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then:

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are
               clogged with dust.  We overheated and
               burned out a whole cell.

                              STANDARD
                    (strikes his panel)
               Damn it!  How long to fix?

                              ROBY
                    (into microphone)

               Hard to say.

                              ROBY
               Well, get started.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Right.  Talk to you.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take a look outside.  Turn the
               screens back on.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black.

                              BROUSSARD
               Can't see a blessed thing.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute
     darkness around it.

     THE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING
     LIGHTS.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              STANDARD
               Kick on the floods.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     A ring of FLOODLIGHTS on the ship come to life, pouring blinding light
     out into the night.

     They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and
     clouds of blowing dust.  The wind shrieks.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              ROBY
               Not much help.

     Standard stares at the dark screens.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we can't go anywhere in this
               darkness.  How long till dawn?

                              MELKONIS
                    (consults his instruments)
               Well... this rock rotates every two
               hours.  The sun should be coming up
               in about 20 minutes.

                              BROUSSARD
               Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see
               something then.

                              ROBY
               Or something will be able to see us.

     They all look at him.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT (MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE)

     The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the
     darkness and the storm.  MAIN THEME MUSIC BEGINS, EXTREMELY OMINOUS.

     THE TITLE APPEARS:

                              ALIEN

     RUN TITLES.

     Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES.  The
     silhouette of the SNARK becomes visible, like some strange insect
     crouching motionless on the barren plain.  The floods shut off.  Dense
     clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and
     reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.

     END MAIN TITLES.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange
     dust.

     PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.  The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, and
     Melkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffee
     and staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust.

                              ROBY
               There could be a whole city out
               there and we'd never see it.

                              BROUSSARD
               Not sitting on our butts in here,
               that's for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any
               response yet?

                              MELKONIS
                    (pulls off his earphones)
               Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn
               transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've
               tried every frequency on the
               spectrum.

                              BROUSSARD
               Are we just going to sit around and
               wait for an invitation?

     Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his console
     and speaks into the mike.

                              ROBY

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speaking
     into a wall intercom.

                              FAUST
               I never saw anything as fine as this
               dust... these cells are all pitted on
               a microscopic level.  I have to
               polish these things smooth again, so
               it's going to take a while.  Okay?

               Sandy... how far are we from the
               source of the transmission?

                              MELKONIS
               Source of transmission is to the
               northeast... about 300 meters.

                              ROBY
               Close... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Close enough to walk to!

                              STANDARD

               Zero.  Dry as a bone.

                              STANDARD
               Any microorganisms?

                              ROBY

                              ROBY
               Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we won't need pressure suits,
               but breathing masks are called for.
               Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of
               portable unit that we can use to
               follow that transmission to its
               source?

     Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams
     into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE
     WIND OUTSIDE.

     A mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it
     hits the ground.

     Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet.
     Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock.

     The men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at
     their clothes.  Nothing can be seen.

                              STANDARD
               Which way, Sandy?

     Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder.

                              MELKONIS
                    (pointing)
               That way.

                              STANDARD
               You lead.

     Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the
     others.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Martin.  We're on our way.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his
     console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a
     screen.

                              ROBY
               Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you
               on my board.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Good.  I'm getting you clear too.
               Let's just keep the line open.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and
     shrieking wind.  With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements,
     they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean.

     Melkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction
     finder.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Can't see more than three meters in
               any direction out here.  We're
               walking blind, on instruments.

     They wade on, following Melkonis.  Abruptly he halts.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               What's wrong?

                              MELKONIS
               My signal's fading.

     He studies the direction finder.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               It's the dust, it's interfering... 

     His concentration is so great that he does NOT NOTICE HUNTER COMING UP
     BEHIND HIM.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... Hold it, I've got it again.  It's
               over that way.

     Standing DIRECTLY BEHIND ROBY, Hunter speaks.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening?

     Startled out of his wits, Roby GASPS and whirls around to face Hunter.

                              ROBY
                    (startled silly)
               Hell!

     Hunter stares at Roby, whose momentary terror dissolves into
     embarrassed anger.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men push their way through the storm.  Melkonis stops again,
     studies the direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               It's close, real close.

                              STANDARD
               How far?

                              MELKONIS
               We should be almost on top of it.  I
               just can't quite... 

     Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points.  The others stare
     in the direction he is pointing.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POINT-OF-VIEW

     Through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out
     some kind of HUGE SHAPE.

     As we watch, the dust clears slightly, REVEALING A GROTESQUE SHIP
     RISING FROM THE SHIP LIKE SOME GIGANTIC TOADSTOOL.  It is clearly of
     non-human manufacture.

     ANGLE ON THE MEN

     They are struck dumb by the sight of the craft.  Finally, Standard
     finds his voice.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, uh, we've found it.

                              ROBY
                    (sharply -- over, filtered)
               Found what?

                              STANDARD
               It appears to be some sort of
               spacecraft.  We're going to approach
               it.

     They start toward the alien ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               There are no signs of life.  No
               lights... no movement... 

     Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               We're, uh, approaching the base.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF TOADSTOOL SHIP - DAY

     A strangely shaped DOOR yawns open at the base of the ship.  Dust and
     sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance.

     With great caution, the men approach the entrance and group around it.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Appears to be a door hanging open,
               the entrance is clogged with debris.

                              BROUSSARD
               Looks like a derelict.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to
               hold the conversation to a minimum
               from here on.

     INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DAY

     The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness,
     spewing dust.  In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless
     shapes.

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the
     doorway.  They switch on flashlight-like devices called "DATASTICKS",
     and step in.

   

   

     Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct
     machinery.

                              MELKONIS
               Air lock?

                              STANDARD
               Who knows?

                              BROUSSARD
               Let's try and find the control room.

     As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls,
     ceiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.

                              MELKONIS
               Look at these holes.  This place
               looks like Swiss cheese.

     Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.

                              BROUSSARD
               This hole goes up several decks --
               looks like somebody was firing a
               military disintegrator in here.

     They all peer up the hole into darkness.

                              STANDARD
               Climbing gear.

     Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it.
     He aims it up into the hole and fires.

     The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There
     is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll go first.

                              STANDARD
               No, you'll follow me.

     Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and
     presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the
     hole, using his feet for leverage where he can.

     Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP

     This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the
     hole.

     Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a
     beam through the hanging dust.

     Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own
     light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole.

     THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns
     of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes.

     Broussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it.

     It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings.
     Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is
     empty.

     Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have
     illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON,
     SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR.

     They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS A
     GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.

                              MELKONIS
               Holy Christ... 

     Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton
     is seated.  He moves his light closer and peers at the panel.

                              STANDARD
               Look at this... 

     They approach.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Something has been scratched here... 
               into the veneer.  See?

     Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a
     sharp instrument, is a small triangle:

   

   

     Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the
     beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES.

     Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.

                              MELKONIS
               LOOK OUT, IT MOVED!

     Standard knocks his hand down.

                              STANDARD
               Keep away from that gun!

     Standard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he
     begins to move toward the far side of the room.

     They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it.
     There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back
     and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Just machinery.

                              BROUSSARD
               But functioning.

     Melkonis looks down at his direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               That's where the transmission is
               coming from.

     He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a
     hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones.

                              BROUSSARD
               A recording.  A damned automatic
               recording.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET

     SINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK.  As we watch, the sunlight turns the color
     of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its
     wake.  The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly
     combatting the darkness and the storm.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching
     holographic pictures projected onto a screen.  These are photos taken
     by their "datasticks" (flashlight/cameras).

     Standard is commenting on the changing slides.

                              STANDARD
               ... This is the control room... 

     Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the
     suited men standing against banks of machinery.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... Some details of the control
               room... 

     The SKELETON appears on the screen.  The men react with mutters.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is the skeleton... another
               view of the skeleton... the
               transmitting device... 

     The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is a closeup of the triangle
               we found scrawled on the console in
               front of the skeleton... 

     Standard changes the slide.  The screen goes white.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... And that's it.

     He turns off the projector and brings the lights up.

                              HUNTER
               Phenomenal.  Staggering.

                              BROUSSARD
               We've got to go back and take a lot
               more pictures, holograph
               everything.

                              MELKONIS
               And bring back as much physical
               evidence as possible, too.  The rest
               of the skeleton.  Some of the
               machinery.  Written records, if there
               are any.

     Roby is slumped in his chair.  He has said nothing.

                              STANDARD
               Martin?

                              ROBY
               I agree.  This is the single most
               important discovery in history.

                              STANDARD
               But?

                              ROBY
               What killed it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, that thing's been dead for
               years.  Maybe hundreds of years.  The
               whole planet's dead.

                              FAUST
               The way I figure it, they landed
               here for repairs or something, then
               they couldn't take off again.  Maybe
               the dust ruined their engines.  They
               set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody
               came.  So they died.

                              ROBY
               He died.

                              FAUST
               What?

                              ROBY
               Not they... he... 

     They all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod.  CAMERA MOVES
     OVER TO REVEAL THE ALIEN SKULL SITTING ON A TABLE.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               ... There was only one skeleton.

     There is a moment of silence.

                              STANDARD
               Jay... how's it coming on the
               repairs?

                              FAUST
               Well... I'm going to have to blow the
               engines out... 

                              STANDARD
               And when will you be ready to do
               that?

                              FAUST
               Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

                              STANDARD
               Then why the hell are you sitting
               around here?

                              FAUST
               Right.

     The men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in
     thought, staring at the skull.  Melkonis lingers in the room with him.

                              MELKONIS
               And there sits man's first contact
               with intelligent life in the
               universe.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON THE SHIP, its spotlights cutting into the gloom.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     A room throbbing with power, enormous pulsing engines capable of
     releasing unimaginable energies.

     Faust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the
     engines, with spotlights on it.  He is wearing goggles and thin gloves.

                              FAUST
               You ready up there?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Broussard and Melkonis are seated at their consoles, conversing with
     Faust while they watch their instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure, we're ready.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

                              FAUST
               Okay.  I'm going to start the
               extraction procedure now.

     He pauses to wipe his brow.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the
     photographic slides on the screen.  He is clicking slowly through them.
     He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it.

     The alien's misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him.  He
     picks it up, holds it up to the screen for comparison, and studies it.

     Standard appears in the doorway.

                              STANDARD
               Alas, poor Yorick.

     Roby STARTS, puts down the skull.  Standard sits at the table.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (nodding at the screen)
               Find anything we missed?

                              ROBY
                    (shrugs)
               I don't even know what I'm looking
               for.

                              STANDARD
               Still worried?

                              ROBY
               Oh well... you know me.

                              STANDARD
               I've always respected your opinion,
               Martin.  If something worries you, it
               worries me.

     Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY
     DRAWN TRIANGLE ON THE ALIEN CONTROL PANEL.

                              ROBY
               What would you say that was supposed
               to mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well... it's obviously intentional... 
               some kind of attempt at
               communication... maybe it's a symbol
               that means something to them... 

                              ROBY
               But why draw it on the wall?

     Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily.

     He rises and goes to the coffee machine.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (picking a hair out of
                     the coffeepot)
               This ship is full of cat hair.

                              STANDARD
               Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as
               the engine's fixed --

     BEEP!  The communicator interrupts Standard.  He leans across and
     presses the button.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               This is Chaz.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come
               topside for a minute?

                              STANDARD
               What's up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Well, the sun just came up again,
               and it seems the wind's died down.
               It's as clear as a bell outside.
               There's something I think you ought
               to see.

                              STANDARD
               I'm on my way.

     He and Roby head for the door.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive.

                              STANDARD
               What is it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Take a look.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The dust no longer blows.  The day is crisp, clear, and silent.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               I was scanning the horizon to see
               what I could pick up.  Look there, on
               that screen.

                              STANDARD
               What is it, I can't --

     BLIP!  Broussard enlarges the image.

     The screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon.

     They all stare at the image for a long moment.  The silhouette of the
     PYRAMID IS INSTANTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE SCRAWLED TRIANGLE in the alien
     ship.

   

   

     Standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz.  All hands topside.
               Now.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     ANGLE ON A VIEWSCREEN.  It shows the PYRAMID on the horizon.  CAMERA
     PULLS BACK to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the
     room.

                              STANDARD
               Doesn't seem much doubt about it,
               does there?

                              MELKONIS
               That creature sure must have
               considered it important... using his
               last strength to draw it... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe they built it.

                              FAUST
               As what?

                              BROUSSARD
               A marker for buried instrumentation?

                              HUNTER
               Or a mass grave.

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe the rest of the crew is in
               there -- in some kind of suspended
               animation, waiting to be rescued.

                              MELKONIS
               It wasn't necessarily built by them.

     On the screens, a puff of DUST blows in front of the pyramid.

                              ROBY
               Here comes the dust again.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     WITH A SHRIEK, THE DUST STORM RETURNS, completely obscuring the SNARK.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Well, does anyone else agree with
               Martin that we should not explore
               it?

     Everyone looks around the room, but no one volunteers.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Then the sooner we get moving, the
               better.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     LONG SHOT OF THE STONE PYRAMID, dust blowing in front of it.  It is a
     crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless,
     tapering toward the top.

     Standard, Broussard, and Melkonis, wearing the protective suits,
     approach the pyramid.  As they draw near, it becomes clear that the
     pyramid is roughly 50 feet tall.

                              STANDARD
               We can't make out any details or
               features yet... but it's definitely
               too regular for a natural
               formation... 

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby and Hunter are present.  They are listening to Standard's VOICE ON
     THE RADIO.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... There's one thing I can say for
               sure though... 

     BUZZZZZ!  Standard's voice is DROWNED OUT BY STATIC.

                              ROBY
               Now what's wrong?

                              HUNTER
               I've completely lost their signal.

                              ROBY
               Can you get them back?

                              HUNTER
               I'm trying.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The three men come to the base of the massive structure.  Dust and sand
     have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the
     base.

                              MELKONIS
               This looks ancient.

                              STANDARD
               Can't tell -- these weather
               conditions could erode anything,
               fast.

     They walk around the base.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's no entrance.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe the entrance is buried.  Could
               be under our feet.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe there is no entrance; the
               thing may be solid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Well, there ought to be some way we
               can get through to them --

     The INTERCOM BEEPS.  Faust's voice is heard.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna
               charge up the engines for a minute,
               okay?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.

     A LOUD, POWERFUL THROBBING BEGINS, drowning out all other sounds, as
     the engines are tested.

     A light on Roby's panel is FLASHING.  We can see that it is the
     COMPUTER ALERT.

     Irritably, Roby throws the switch.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Yes!

                              COMPUTER
               I have a temporary sequence on the
               monitor --

                              ROBY
               Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!

     He puts an earphone to his ear and switches the computer's voice over.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Go ahead!

     There is a PAUSE while Roby listens to the computer.  His eyes widen.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               You mean... you've translated it?

     Another PAUSE as he listens to the earphone.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Well come on, come on!  What does it
               say?

     Another PAUSE.  Roby's face changes; he looks CHILLED TO THE BONE.  His
     mouth works.

     Abruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE.

                              HUNTER
                    (looking over at Roby)
               What?  What was that?

                              ROBY
               The computer just translated the
               goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S.
               It was a warning.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe we can get in by the top.

                              STANDARD
               You want to try?

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure.

     Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the
     top of the pyramid.  It catches.  He clips himself to the wire.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               You guys just wait down here till I
               say it's okay to come up.

     Broussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side
     of the pyramid.

     OMINOUS ANGLES showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust
     blowing, the wind shrieking.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair.  Broussard arrives at
     the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's a hole at the top.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Can we come up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               No, it's too small, only room enough
               for one person.

                              STANDARD
               Can you see anything in the hole?

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard leans over and looks into the hole.  He sees only blackness.

     Freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on
     the "flashlight" function, and shines it down into the hole.

                              BROUSSARD
               I can see... partway down.  It just
               goes down like a stovepipe.  Smooth
               walls.  I can't see the bottom --
               light won't reach.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Faust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face.

                              FAUST
               Yes?  What is it?

                              ROBY
               Jay, we've got a problem.  I was
               wondering if there was any way you
               could shortcut the repairs and give
               us immediate takeoff capability.

                              FAUST
                    (quickly)
               Why, what's wrong?

                              ROBY
               The computer's translated the alien
               signal, and it's kind of alarming.

                              FAUST
               What do you mean?

                              ROBY
               It couldn't translate the whole
               thing, only three phrases.  I'll just
               read it to you the way I got it:
                    (reads from a strip of paper)
               "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO
               NOT LAND... "
                    (looks up at the others)
               And that's all it could translate.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Hanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from
     his belt.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Dell, you want to come down, we can
               figure out where to go from here.

                              BROUSSARD
               No, I want to go in.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Standard and Melkonis exchange a glance.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Dell, but just for a
               preliminary look-around.  Don't
               unhook yourself from your cable.  And
               be out in less than ten minutes.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

     Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He
     unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end
     of it to his chest unit.

     He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by
     the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Okay, I'm in the mouth of the
               chimney now, and I'm starting down.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Take care.

     Broussard activates the climbing unit and lowers himself down into the
     hole.

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel,
     Broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the
     depths.

     The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in darkness.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's noticeably warmer in here.  Warm
               air rising from below.

     He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops,
     pushing off each time with his feet.

     He stops to catch his breath.  His breathing rasps loudly in his
     helmet.

     A little sunlight filters down from above.  Looking up, he can see the
     mouth of the hole, a glowing spot of light.

     Standard's voice comes over his earphones.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Are you okay in there?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (gasping for breath)
               Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom
               yet.  Definitely a column of warm air
               rising; it keeps the shaft clear of
               dust.

                              STANDARD

               What was that Dell, I lost you, do

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't
               talk now.

     He kicks off and continues down, taking longer and longer hops as he
     gains confidence.

     Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the light on his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               I'm way below ground level.

                              HUNTER
               I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area
               around the pyramid is dead to
               transmission.  I think we should go
               after them.

                              ROBY
               No.

                              HUNTER
               What do you mean, no?

                              ROBY
               We're not going anywhere.

                              HUNTER
               But they don't know about the
               translation!  They could be in danger
               right now.

                              ROBY
               We can't spare the personnel.  We've
               got minimum takeoff capability right
               now.  That's why Chaz left us on
               board.

                              HUNTER
               Why, you chickenshit bastard --

                              ROBY
               Just can that crap!  I'm in command
               here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's
               leaving this ship!

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard resumes his downward climb.  SUDDENLY, HIS FEET LOSE THEIR
     PURCHASE AS THE WALLS OF THE SHAFT DISAPPEAR.

     The tunnel has reached its end.  Below him is an unfathomable,
     cavernous space.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (huffing and puffing)
               Tunnel's gone -- cave or something
               below me -- feels like the tropics
               in here; air is warm and humid... 
                    (consults his instruments)
               ... high oxygen content, no dust,
               it's completely breathable --

     Puffing with exertion, he releases his purchase on the stone walls and
     begins to lower himself on power.  Now he is dangling free in darkness,
     spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds.

     Finally, his feet hit bottom.  He grunts in surprise and almost loses
     his balance.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - DAY

     Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of
     sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above.  Around is
     solid darkness.

     He flashes his datastick around.  The beam reveals that he is in a
     stone room.  STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls.  They have
     a primitive, religious appearance.  Row after row of pictograms stretch
     from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language.  Huge
     religious symbols dominate one wall.

     Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque
     monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's unbelievable!  It's like some
               kind of tomb... some primitive
               religion!  Hey, is anybody there?  Do
               you read me?  Standard!

     Annoyed, Broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them
     hanging around his neck.  He takes a deep breath of the wet air.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - LATE AFTERNOON

     Standard and Melkonis are standing around nervously.

                              STANDARD
               If we don't hear from him soon, I
               think we better go in after him.

                              MELKONIS
               Sun will be down in a minute.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - LATE AFTERNOON

     Face bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is
     dominated by a large, broad pedestal.  On the pedestal are ROWS OF
     LEATHERY URNS OR JARS, EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE BROUSSARD STUMBLED ACROSS
     IN THE ALIEN SHIP -- EXCEPT THESE ARE ALL SEALED.

     He walks around the urns, studying them.  They all have sealed lids.  He
     shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it.

     He lifts his mask radio to his lips.

                              BROUSSARD
               I don't know if you can hear me, but
               the place is full of large bottles
               or jars, just like the one we found
               on the other ship -- except these
               are all sealed.  Also they're soft to
               the touch.

     He peers more closely at the leathery object.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Another funny thing -- I just put my
               hand on it, and now there are these
               raised areas appearing where my
               fingertips were.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     THE SUN DROPS BELOW THE HORIZON, throwing the landscape into gloom.
     Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights.

                              STANDARD
               Let's go.

     He attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - NIGHT

     Broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the
     wall.  They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters.

     He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he
     turns back to the "urn" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN
     THE TOP OF IT.

     He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn."  There lies
     the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and
     studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside
     surface is spongy and irregular.

     Then he turns the light to the now-open "urn."

     He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, AND WITH
     SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES
     ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD.

     With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the
     thing with his hands.

   

   

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT

     The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top,
     lights bobbing in the darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (puffing with exertion)
               Here's his line.  We can haul him out
               of there if we have to.

                              MELKONIS
               It'll yank him right off his feet if
               he's not expecting it.  The line
               could get tangled in something.

                              STANDARD
               But what can we do?  He's out of
               radio contact.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we should just wait a few more
               minutes.

     Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole.

                              STANDARD
                    (making up his mind)
               No, I told him to be out in ten
               minutes.  It's been much longer.
               Let's get him out of there.

     Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the
     tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which
     Broussard's line dangles.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               The line's slack.  Christ, do you
               think the idiot unhooked himself?

     He switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the
     line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the
     motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               There, it caught!

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still coming up, or is it
               hooked on something?

                              STANDARD
               No, it's coming.

                              MELKONIS
               Can you see anything?

     Standard shines his light down into the hole.

                              STANDARD
               No, I can't see far enough.  The
               line's moving, though.

     For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid,
     saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls.
     Then Standard shines his light back down in.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I can see him!  Here he comes!

     The winch begins to LABOR HEAVILY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Get ready to grab him!

     Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the
     wire.  Standard reaches for him -- then RECOILS SHARPLY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Look out!  There's something on
               his face!

     Melkonis attempts to come to his aid.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               Don't touch him, watch it!

     In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally
     regain their balance.  They shine their lights on Broussard.

     He appears to be completely unconscious -- AND THE OCTOPUS THING IS
     STILL WRAPPED AROUND HIS FACE, MOTIONLESS.

                              MELKONIS
               Oh God, oh God no.

                              STANDARD
               Help me -- I'm going to try to get
               it off.

     With his gloved hands, Standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to
     pull it from Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It won't come -- it's stuck.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               How the hell should I know?  Come on,
               give me a hand, let's get him out of
               there!

     The two men grapple with Broussard's limp body, lifting him from the
     hole.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent.  There is a long moment
     while nothing is said, then:

                              HUNTER
               I've got 'em!  They're back on my
               screens!

                              ROBY
                    (leaps to his feet)
               How many?

                              HUNTER
               Three blips!  They're coming this
               way!

     Roby grabs a microphone.

                              ROBY
                    (into mike)
               Hey, can you guys hear me?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming
               back!

                              ROBY
               Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen,
               there's been a new development --

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Can't talk now; Broussard's injured.
               We'll need some help getting him
               into the ship.

     Roby collapses into a chair, suddenly limp with apprehension.  He's
     feared something like this all along, and now it has begun to happen.

                              ROBY
                    (to himself)
               Oh no.

                              HUNTER
                    (into intercom)
               Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the
               main air lock!

     Hunter dashes from the room.

     Roby remains where he is, seated at his console.  He is stunned, his
     mind racing.  CAMERA MOVES IN ON HIS FACE.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     Hunter comes racing down the steps and hurries up to the inner lock
     door.

     He presses the wall intercom.

                              HUNTER
                    (into intercom)
               Martin, I'm by the inner lock door!
               I'll wait here for you to let them
               in!

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              ROBY
                    (strangely quiet)
               Right.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     Faust comes running up, covered with grime.

                              FAUST
               What the hell's going on?

                              HUNTER
               Don't know -- Broussard got hurt
               somehow.

                              FAUST
               Hurt!  How?

                              HUNTER
               Don't know -- maybe we'll be real
               lucky and he just broke his neck.
                    (a beat)
               I knew we shouldn't of come down
               here.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Roby is seated alone in the room, listening to the transmission from
     Standard and Melkonis.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, are you there?

     Roby leans forward and speaks into the microphone.

                              ROBY
               Here, Chaz.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We're coming up now, open the outer
               lock door.

                              ROBY
               Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               It's some kind of organism, it's
               attached itself to him.  Let us in.

     Roby does not reply.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer
               door.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, if it's an organism, and we
               let it in, the ship will be
               infected.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We can't leave him out here, open
               the door.

                              ROBY
                    (urgently)
               Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken
               every rule of quarantine.  If we
               bring an organism on board, we won't
               have a single layer of defense left.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is an order!  Open the
               door!

     Hating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     A RED LIGHT goes on, on a console on the wall.  The whine of a large
     servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic CLUNK.

                              HUNTER
               Outer door's open.

     After a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another
     CLUNK.  The outer door has closed again.  The red light goes off.

     The inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through,
     carrying the sagging body of Broussard.  A cloud of choking dust
     follows them out of the lock.

                              STANDARD
                    (pulling off his mask)
               You men stay clear, there's a
               parasite on him.

     Hunter and Faust RECOIL.

                              HUNTER
               Oh -- God -- oh --

                              FAUST
               Is it alive?

                              STANDARD
               I don't know but don't touch it.
               Give us a hand here, let's get him
               up to the Autodoc.

     Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     One of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the
     medical room, carrying Broussard.

     Revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with
     machinery.  The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed,
     which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.

                              STANDARD
               Help me, come on, let's get him up
               here.

     They slide the man onto the bunk.

                              HUNTER
               That thing, God almighty, didn't you
               try to get it off him?

                              STANDARD
               It wouldn't come.

     Standard yanks off his gloves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Medical gloves.

     They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull
     them on.

     Gingerly, they approach Broussard.

     Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing
     on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to
     pull it free.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It's really on there tight.

                              FAUST
               Here, let me try.

     Faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip
     of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his
     weight.

                              STANDARD
                    (grabbing Faust's hands)
               Stop it, you're tearing his face.

     A trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek.

                              MELKONIS
               It's not coming off -- not without
               his whole face coming off too.

                              STANDARD
               Let's let the machine work on him.

     Efficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a
     couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard
     is sucked into the slot in the wall.

     He is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of
     disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light.

     A bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different
     parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.

     ROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.

     Standard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard
     each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE
     FACE.

     The others are shocked.

                              HUNTER
               Hey now, what is this?

                              STANDARD
               Ask him.

                              ROBY
                    (slowly puts his hand
                     to his cheek)
               I understand why you did that.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

                              MELKONIS
               He wouldn't open the lock; he was
               going to leave us out there.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I
               mean, you brought the goddamn thing
               in here.  Maybe you deserve to get
               slapped.

                              FAUST
                    (embarrassed)
               Excuse me, I've got work to do.

     Faust exits.

                              HUNTER
               I keep my mouth pretty much shut,
               but I don't like hitting.

                              ROBY
                    (to Standard)
               I guess I had it coming.  Let's call
               it settled.

     After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns
     his attention to the machinery.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (slowly)
               Would somebody fill me in?

                              STANDARD
               He went into the pyramid alone.  We
               lost radio contact with him.  When we
               pulled him out, it was on his face.
               It won't come off, not without
               injuring him.

                              HUNTER
               Where did it come from?

                              MELKONIS
               He's the only one that knows that.

                              HUNTER
               How does he breathe?

     They study the monitors.

                              MELKONIS
               Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth
               are blocked.

                              STANDARD
               Let's look inside his head.

     Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray
     image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER
     TORSO.

     The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the
     creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is
     that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open,
     and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED
     INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.

                              ROBY
               Look at that.

                              HUNTER
               What is it -- I can't tell
               anything --

                              ROBY
               It's some kind of organ -- it's
               inserted some kind of tube or
               something down his throat.

                              HUNTER
                    (turning sick)
               Oh... God... 

     Hunter bends over and RETCHES.

                              ROBY
               I think that's how it's getting
               oxygen to him.

                              HUNTER
               It doesn't make any sense.  It
               paralyzes him... puts him into a
               coma... then keeps him alive.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't expect to understand a life
               form like this.  We're out of our
               back yard.  Things are different
               here.

                              HUNTER
               Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we
               can't leave the damn thing on him.

                              MELKONIS
               We don't know what might happen if
               we tried to kill it.  At least right
               now it's keeping him alive.

                              HUNTER
               How about cutting it off?  We can't
               pull it loose, but we can cut off
               everything but the bottom layer,
               where it's stuck to his face.

                              STANDARD
               You're right... we can't stand here
               and do nothing.

     Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head.
     Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch
     and Broussard slides back out of the booth.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled in his mask)
               Somebody give me a scalpel.

     Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall,
     and carefully passes it to Standard.

     Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his
     hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button
     with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum.

     Standard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously.
     Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and
     holds it inconspicuously at his side.

     Standard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to
     the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the
     back of Broussard's head.

     Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue.
     Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               I've made an incision... it's not
               reacting... but some kind of
               yellowish fluid is leaking out of
               the wound... 

     The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to
     Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of
     smoke curls up from the stain.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               Hold it, this stuff's smoking!

     The others REACT nervously.

     By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has
     dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble
     and sizzle, and more smoke rises.

     The men start to COUGH.

                              MELKONIS
               God, that smoke's poisonous!

                              HUNTER
                    (pointing)
               It's eating a hole in the floor!

     Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the
     corridor outside, coughing their lungs out.

     Standard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a
     bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and
     in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They
     begin to smoke.

     Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves.
     Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

                              STANDARD
               That stuff's eating right through
               the metal!  It's going to eat through
               the decks and right out through the
               hull!

     By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to
     the level below.

                              STANDARD
               There!  Look!

     A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and
     drips to the floor.

     It bubbles on the floor.

                              MELKONIS
               Jesus, what can we put under it?

     Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below.

     INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW

     Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at
     the ceiling.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               There.  Should be coming through
               about there.

                              HUNTER
               Careful, don't get under it!

     INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE

     Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid
     sizzles.

                              MELKONIS
               Christ, that stinks.

     Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the
     floor.

                              ROBY
               Seems to have stopped penetrating.

     Hunter comes charging up the steps.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening up here?

                              ROBY
               I think it's fizzled out.

     Hunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the
     pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by
     the end.

                              MELKONIS
               I never saw anything like that in my
               life... except molecular acid.

                              HUNTER
               But this thing uses it for blood.

                              MELKONIS
               Hell of a defense mechanism.  You
               don't dare kill it.

     Standard comes up the stairs.

                              STANDARD
               It's stopped?

                              MELKONIS
               Yes, thank heaven.

                              STANDARD
               We're just plain lucky.  That could
               have gone right through the hull --
               taken weeks to patch it.

                              MELKONIS
               Reminded me of when I was a kid and
               the roof leaked -- everybody running
               for the pots and pans.

                              ROBY
               My God, what about Broussard?

     They turn and run up the stairs.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen).
     Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.

                              ROBY
               Did it get on him?

     Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD
               No, thank God... just missed him.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still dripping?

                              STANDARD
                    (examining it)
               It appears to have healed itself.

                              HUNTER
               It makes me sick to see him like
               that.

                              MELKONIS
               Isn't there some way we can get it
               off him?

                              STANDARD
               I don't see how.  But let's do what
               we can for him.

     Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the
     diagnostic coffin.  He presses more buttons, and the displays light up
     again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think we'd better get some
               intravenous feeding started.  God
               knows what that thing is leaching
               out of him.

     Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade
     Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.

                              ROBY
                    (studying the screens)
               Look there, what's that stain on his
               lungs?

     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's
     chest.  In the center, the stain is completely opaque.

                              MELKONIS
               It appears to be a heavy fluid of
               some sort... it blocks the X-rays... 

                              ROBY
               That tube must be depositing it in
               him.

                              MELKONIS
               Could be some kind of venom, or
               poison... 

                              HUNTER
               This is horrible.

                              ROBY
               Hey!  what about the film?

                              STANDARD
               What film?

                              ROBY
               Broussard had film in his datastick,
               didn't he?  We can see what happened
               to him.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Again we are watching slides in the darkened room.  This time Standard,
     Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs
     taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.

     The camera reveals the "urns."  The climax of the sequence of stills
     comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA --
     and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to
     show a series of meaningless blurs.  Then the reel ends.

                              HUNTER
               That must have been when he got it.

                              ROBY
               The same thing must've happened to
               the creatures on the other ship... 
               except they took one of those jars
               on board, and opened it there.

                              MELKONIS
                    (clicks back through the
                     slides to a picture of
                     one of the "urns")
               At first I thought they were jars
               too, or artifacts anyway.  But
               they're not.  They're eggs, or spore
               casings.  Let's go back to the
               heiroglyphics.

     CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a
     blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of
     heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.

                              STANDARD
               I personally can't make any sense
               out of it... 

     CLICK.  CLICK.  Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing
     different angles on the glyphs.

                              MELKONIS
               It's a crude symbolic language --
               looks primitive.

                              HUNTER
               You can't tell -- that kind of stuff
               could represent printed circuits... 

                              STANDARD
               That sounds a little fanciful... 

                              MELKONIS
               Primitive pictorial languages are
               based on common objects in the
               environment, and this can be used as
               a starting point for translation... 

                              ROBY
               What common objects?

                              HUNTER
               Listen, hadn't somebody better check
               on Broussard?

                              STANDARD
                    (rising)
               I'll do it.  The rest of you
               continue.

                              HUNTER
                    (rising)
               I'll come with you.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

     Standard and Hunter come down the passageway.

                              STANDARD
               You know, it's fantastic -- the
               human race has gone this long
               without ever encountering another
               advanced life form, and now we run
               into a veritable zoo.

                              HUNTER
               What do you mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well, those things out there aren't
               the same, you know -- the spaceship
               and the pyramid.  They're from
               different cultures and different
               races.  That ship just landed here --
               crashed like we did.  The pyramid and
               the thing from it are indigenous.

                              HUNTER
               How could anything be indigenous to
               this asteroid?  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe it wasn't always dead.

     They arrive at the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     The door slides open, and they step into the room.  Hunter activates
     the bed, and it slides out of the wall.

     THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.

                              HUNTER
               It's gone.

     They rush to Broussard's prone form.  THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HIS
     FACE.

     Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing.  HIS FACE IS
     COVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.

                              HUNTER
               Now we're in for it.

                              STANDARD
               The door was closed.  It must still
               be in here.

     They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the
     door.  Standard grabs his arm.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               No, don't open the door.  We don't
               want it escaping.

                              HUNTER
                    (very nervous)
               Well, what the hell good can we do
               in here?  We can't grab it -- it
               might jump on us --

                              STANDARD
               Maybe we can catch it.

     Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               As long as we're careful not to
               damage it... 

     Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly
     around the room.  There are very few places to hide.

     He bends down and peers under the bunk.

     As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE
     THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.

     He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO
     THE FLOOR.

                              STANDARD
                    (leaping back)
               Shit!

     But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its
     tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.

     Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and
     takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not
     respond.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think it's dead.

     With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite
     into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid.

     INTERIOR - LABORATORY

     Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a
     stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up.

     Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.

                              STANDARD
               Look at these suckers -- no wonder
               we couldn't get it off him.

                              ROBY
               Is that its mouth?

                              MELKONIS
               More likely that organ -- the tube-
               like thing -- fits up in there.

     With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy
     aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.

                              ROBY
               Ugh.

     Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.

                              STANDARD
               Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme
               something to grab it with!

     It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.

     Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at
     Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes
     the thing in the tongs.

     It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Christ!  Let's get it out of here!

     Carrying the thing, he heads for the door.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing
     in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     They come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the
     inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is
     already on the intercom:

                              ROBY
                    (shouts into intercom)
               For Chrissake, open the main lock!

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the
     thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed
     by the inevitable dust.

     Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY

     The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust,
     smouldering and fuming.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     The outer door rolls shut.

                              ROBY
                    (slumping against the
                     wall)
               My God, it's lethal even when it's
               dead!

     Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in
     the floor.

     Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor.  There,
     he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              HUNTER
                    (over intercom,
                     filtered)
               Yes?

                              STANDARD
               How's Broussard?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               He's running a fever.

                              STANDARD
               Still unconscious?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               Yes.

                              STANDARD
               Can you do anything for him?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               The machine will bring his
               temperature down.  His vital
               functions are strong.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

     He switches off the intercom.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (suddenly exhausted)
               I need some coffee.

     He turns and walks away.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats;
     Standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.

                              MELKONIS
               These day and night cycles are
               totally disorienting.  I feel like
               we've been here for days, but it's
               only been how long?

                              ROBY
                    (stroking the cat)
               About four hours.

                              STANDARD
                    (staring into his coffee
                     cup)
               I'm sorry to say it looks like you
               were right in the first place,
               Martin.  We never should have landed
               here.

                              ROBY
               Look, I'm not trying to rub
               anybody's nose in anything.  The
               important thing is just to get away
               from here as fast as possible.

                              STANDARD
               I can't lean on Faust any harder --
               he's been working non-stop on the
               engines.

                              ROBY
               If we knew exactly what happened to
               the beings on the other ship --

                              MELKONIS
               We do know that.

                              ROBY
               Yeah?

                              MELKONIS
               They never made it off the planet.
               The parasites won.

     This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.

                              ROBY
               Where did the parasites come from?

                              STANDARD
               They seem native to the planet.  It's
               got an atmosphere and a dense
               gravity.  It's dead now, but once it
               must have been fertile.

                              MELKONIS
               No.  It's just too small to support
               fauna as big as the parasites.  If
               there were a native ecology, it
               would have to be microscopic.

                              ROBY
               Couldn't the pyramid have been built
               here by space travellers?

                              STANDARD
               Too primitive.  It's a pre-
               technological construction.  That
               slab was engineered by an Iron-Age
               culture at best.

                              MELKONIS
               They're from a dead civilization;
               they're spores from a tomb.  God
               knows how long they've been here.

                              ROBY
               I think we better take another look
               at those heiroglyphs.

     Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in.  He is covered
     with dirt and grime.

                              FAUST
               Hey, guess what?

                              STANDARD
               What?

                              FAUST
               The engines are fixed.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK's engines cough and then with a ROAR BEGIN TO BELCH OUT
     STREAMS OF SUPERHEATED AIR, cutting through the tulgy dust.

     The ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimited
     power.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     They are all at their posts.

                              STANDARD
               Switch on tractor beams.

     There is a hair-tingling ELECTRICAL HUM which permeates the whole
     ship, and it begins to float, like a cork in water.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Lock tractor beams.

     The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Retract landing struts.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force.
     The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Take us up.

                              ROBY
                    (into intercom)
               Up one kilometer, Jay.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Switch on lifter quads.

     A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - DAY

     The hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking
     atmosphere.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Engage artificial gravity.

     Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES.

                              ROBY
               Engaged.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take her into an escape orbit.

     The men get busy with switches.

                              ROBY
               I'm altering our vector now; should
               give us an easy escape velocity --

     A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              ROBY & MELKONIS
                    (in concert)
               What was that?

     In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               This dust is getting clogged in the
               intakes again!

                              STANDARD
               Just hold us together till we're in
               space, that's all!

     The pitch of the engines changes, deepens.

     EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY

     The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds.
     Visibility is zero.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning
     to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to
     suck up some of the dust.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS
     THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim,
     set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically
     they mutter technical instructions to each other.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT
     INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They all CHEER.

                              ROBY
                    (pounds his panel)
               We made it!  Damn, we made it!

                              STANDARD
               You bet we made it.  Martin, set
               course for Irth and accelerate us
               into stardrive.

                              ROBY
               With great pleasure.

     Roby begins to punch buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I feel like an escapee from Hell.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER

     The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the
     universe all around.

     There is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching
     the ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red.  This is
     redshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They are unstrapping.

                              ROBY
               That's the part that always makes me
               feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we
               accelerate into light speed.

                              STANDARD
               Quit complaining; we're in space.

     They rise and head out of the room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     As they walk along.

                              STANDARD
               I think the best thing to do with
               Broussard is to just freeze him as
               he is.  It'll arrest the progress of
               his disease, and he can get complete
               medical attention when we get back
               to the Colonies.

                              ROBY
               We'll have to go into quarantine,
               maybe for quite a while.

                              STANDARD
               That's okay, he can remain in
               hypersleep until they're ready to
               treat him.

     They enter the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP
     in BED -- AWAKE.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (hoarsely)
               ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some
               water... 

     Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water.  Broussard gulps it
     down in a swallow.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               More.

     Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard,
     who greedily consumes the entire thing.  Then he sags, panting, on the
     bunk.

                              STANDARD
                    (softly)
               How do you feel, Dell?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (weakly)
               Wretched.  What happened to me?

                              STANDARD
               Don't you remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly
               remember my name.

                              ROBY
               Are you in pain?

                              BROUSSARD
               Not exactly, just feel like
               somebody's been beating me with
               rubber hoses for about six years.

     Melkonis laughs at this remark.  Broussard smiles faintly at him.

                              STANDARD
               Hell, you're in great shape, you've
               got your sense of humor back!

                              BROUSSARD
               God I'm hungry.

                              ROBY
               Dell, what's the last thing you can
               remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               ... I don't know... 

                              ROBY
               Do you remember the pyramid?

                              BROUSSARD
               No.  Just some horrible dreams about
               smothering.  Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               We're going home.  We're in
               hyperspace.

                              MELKONIS
               We're going into the freezers now.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm really starving; can we get some
               food before we go into the freezers?

                              STANDARD
                    (laughs)
               I think that's a pretty reasonable
               request.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions
     greedily.  The cat eats from a dish on the table.

                              HUNTER
               Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a
               straight shot back to the Colonies,
               and then we can start taking bids on
               the paydirt.  Any bets on the top
               bid?

                              FAUST
                    (chewing)
               Well, we should at least be able to
               each buy our own planet.

     They all CHUCKLE.

                              MELKONIS
               I'm going to write a book about this
               expedition.  I'm going to call it
               "The Snark Log."

                              STANDARD
                    (stiffly)
               The commander normally has first
               publication rights.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we could write it together.

                              ROBY
               First thing I'm going to do when we
               get back is eat some biological
               food.

                              MELKONIS
               What's the matter, you don't like
               this stuff?

                              ROBY
               Tastes like something you'd feed a
               chicken to make it lay more eggs.

                              STANDARD
               Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag
               than this, but I've had worse too,
               if you know what I mean.

                              FAUST
               I kind of like it.

                              ROBY
               You like this shit?

                              FAUST
               It grows on you.

                              ROBY
               You know what they make this stuff
               out of?

                              FAUST
                    (annoyed)
               Yes, I know what they make it out
               of, so what?  It's food now.  You're
               eating it.

                              ROBY
               I didn't say it was bad for you,
               it's just kind of sickening, that's
               all.

                              HUNTER
               Do we have to talk about this kind
               of crap at the dinner table?

     Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS.

                              STANDARD
               What's wrong?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (his voice straining)
               I don't know... I'm getting these
               CRAMPS!

     The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips.
     He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles
     whitening.

                              STANDARD
               Breathe deeply.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (screaming)
               OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD!

                              ROBY
               What Dell -- what?

     Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is
     trembling violently from head to foot.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (incoherent shriek)
               OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!

     A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.

     THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS
     TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A
     MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.

     Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and
     bolts.

     The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's
     chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood
     -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and
     scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.

     When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.
     Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest,
     spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with
     blood and slime.

                              HUNTER
               Oh, no.  Oh, no.

                              FAUST
               What was that?  What the Christ was
               that?

                              MELKONIS
               It was growing in him the whole time
               and he didn't even know it!

     Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse.

                              ROBY
               That thing used him for an
               incubator!

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped
     body tumbles silently out.

     AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into
     eternity.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't go into hypersleep with
               that thing running around loose.

                              HUNTER
               We'd be sitting ducks in the
               freezers.

                              ROBY
               But we can't kill it.  If we kill it,
               it will spill all its body acids
               right through our hull and out into
               space.

                              FAUST
               Shit... 

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to catch it and eject it
               from the ship.

                              MELKONIS
                    (sighs)
               Well, I kind of hate to point it
               out, but all our supplies are based
               on us spending a strictly limited
               amount of time out of suspended
               animation... and as you know, we used
               up most of that time in harvesting.

                              STANDARD
               We've got about a week left, right?

                              HUNTER
               And then we run out of food and
               oxygen.

                              FAUST
               The water will still recycle.

                              ROBY
               We won't need it then.

                              STANDARD
               All right, so that's what we've got.
               A week.  It's plenty of time.

                              ROBY
               But if we haven't caught it in a
               week, then we have to go into the
               freezers anyway.

     They enter the bridge.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               So does anybody have any
               suggestions?

                              FAUST
               We could put on our pressure suits
               and blow all the air out of the
               ship.  That would kill it.

                              STANDARD
               No, we can't afford to lose that
               much oxygen.  We're going to have to
               flush it out.

                              MELKONIS
               How?

                              STANDARD
               Room by room, corridor by corridor.

     No one likes this thought.

                              MELKONIS
               And what do we do when we find it?

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we
               had a really strong piece of net, we
               could bag it.

                              FAUST
               We could cut a section out of that
               metallite netting.  It won't hold up
               to that acid, but aside from that
               it's pretty strong.

                              ROBY
               We have to avoid injuring it.  What
               we really need is some electric
               animal prods.

                              HUNTER
               I think I could cobble something
               together.  A long metal rod with a
               battery in it.  Give it a hell of a
               shock.

                              STANDARD
               Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm
               issuing a standing order: from this
               moment forth, every one of us will
               wear protective garments, including
               helmets.  Let's get down to the
               locker and change.

     They start for the exit.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is
     garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot
     policeman, including clear plastic helmet.

     He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different
     gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical
     wall.

     He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside-
     down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down
     them.

     INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space.
     He also wears the protective suit.

     Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie
     here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels
     provide the only illumination.

                              STANDARD
               I thought I'd find you here.

                              MELKONIS
               I was thinking of a line from an old
               poem: "Water, water everywhere, but
               not a drop to drink."  All that space
               out there, and we're trapped in this
               ship.

                              STANDARD
               That's the one about the albatross,
               right?

                              MELKONIS
               We can't even radio for help; the
               carrier wave wouldn't reach its
               destination till long after we'd
               died and turned to dust.  We are
               utterly, absolutely alone.  Can
               anybody really visualize such a
               scale of distances?  Halfway across
               Creation... 

                              STANDARD
               We came out there, we'll go back.  A
               long time by the clock, but a short
               time to us.

                              MELKONIS
               Time and space have no meaning out
               here.  We're living in Einsteinian
               equation.

                              STANDARD
               I can see you're putting your spare
               time to good use.
                    (leans forward and taps
                     him on the knee)
               Let me tell you something: you keep
               staring at hyperspace for long
               enough, they'll be peeling you off a
               wall.  I've seen it happen.

                              MELKONIS
                    (smiles at him)
               We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We
               even have our own special diseases.

                              STANDARD
               Come on -- let's go above and see
               how they're coming with the gear.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of
     shimmering metallic netting.

     Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.

                              HUNTER
               These have portable generators in
               them.  They're insulated down to here
               -- just be careful not to touch the
               end.

     He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal
     object.  A blue spark leaps.

                              FAUST
               Might even incinerate the damn
               thing.

                              STANDARD
                    (sharply)
               I hope not.

                              HUNTER
               Don't worry, it won't damage it,
               it'll just give it a little
               incentive.

                              STANDARD
               How do we locate the creature?

                              FAUST
               With these.

     He picks up a small portable unit.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Tracking device.  You set it to
               search for a moving object... It
               hasn't got much range, but when you
               get within a certain distance, it
               starts beeping.

     Standard takes the device and studies it.

                              STANDARD
               These will be very useful.  At least
               we won't have to go digging around
               in closets with our bare hands.  All
               right, here's the battle plan: we're
               going to break into two teams and
               start systematically covering the
               ship.  Whoever finds it first,
               catches it in the net and ejects it
               from the nearest airlock.  Clear?

                              ROBY
               Even simple.

     Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:

                              STANDARD
               For starters, let's make sure the
               bridge is safe.

     Faust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room.

                              FAUST
               It's clear.

                              STANDARD
               All right -- Roby and Melkonis will
               go with Faust.  Hunter and I will
               make up the second team.

     They start doling out the equipment.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               We'll all carry communicators.  We
               want to keep in constant touch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Melkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it,
     carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to
     side.

                              FAUST
               Nothing yet... nothing... we can move
               pretty fast as long as there's
               nothing on the tracker.

     INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS

     Standard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a
     double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Roby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:

                              FAUST
               Hold it.

     Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               I've got something.

     Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.

                              ROBY
               Where's it coming from?

                              FAUST
                    (peers closely at tracker
                     and frowns)
               Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.
               Needle's spinning all over the dial.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it malfunctioning?

     Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.

                              FAUST
               No, just confused.  It's coming from
               below us.

     They all look down at their feet.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal
     stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.

     The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the
     ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining.

     They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading
     the net across the corridor.

                              ROBY
               Okay.

                              FAUST
                    (looking at tracker and
                     nodding down the passageway)
               That way.

     They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw
     metal flooring.  It is extremely dark.

                              ROBY
               What happened to the lights?

                              FAUST
               Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to
               replace 'em.

     They switch on the helmet lights.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Hold it.

     They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               It's within 4 meters.

     Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust,
     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of
     approaching the source of the signal.

     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any
     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.

     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one
     wall.

     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets
     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,
     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod
     inside.

     WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF
     THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.

     Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:

                              ROBY
                    (very annoyed)
               Oh, hold it!

     They open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and
     spitting, it scampers away.

                              MELKONIS
               We're making fools of ourselves!

     Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              ROBY
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got it up here!  It's trapped!
               Get up here fast!

                              ROBY
               Where are you?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Food-storage room!

                              ROBY
               We're coming!

     They dash for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive
     at:

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Standard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.

                              HUNTER
               We saw it inside and slammed the
               door on it!  It's in there now!

     On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.

                              ROBY
               What's it doing, having a seizure?

                              STANDARD
               It started crashing around right
               after we locked it in.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               I guess we open the door and net it.

                              HUNTER
               I hate to open that door.

     Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.

                              STANDARD
               It looks completely different from
               the first one -- it's more like a
               worm with legs... and tentacles.

                              FAUST
               Well we better do something.

                              HUNTER
               Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped
               in there.  We could just leave it in
               there all the way back to Irth.

                              STANDARD
                    (snaps)
               Don't be an idiot.

                              FAUST
               I know what we can do.  We can pump
               poison gas into the room and kill
               it.  Through those ventilator slots
               there.

     He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.

                              ROBY
               Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our
               food supplies in there!  We can't
               pump poison gas all over them!

                              STANDARD
               Once we kill the thing we won't need
               the food any more -- we can go
               straight into hypersleep.  Also, it
               sounds like that thing is already
               doing a pretty good job on our
               supplies; it may be fouling them
               all.

                              ROBY
               You win.

                              FAUST
               Somebody gimme a hand, I'll get the
               stuff.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATER

     CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel-
     shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door.
     This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large
     metal tank with pressure gauges.

                              STANDARD
               Get those masks on.

     They pull on gas masks.

                              ROBY
               This stuff's deadly -- I hope we
               know what we're doing.

                              STANDARD
               Go ahead, Jay.

     Faust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas
     through the hose and into the room.

     Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN
     BE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING.

     Then the sounds stop altogether.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Shut it off.

     Faust shuts off the pump.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               What do you think?  Now we go in.

     Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows
     out.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     The room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in
     their gasmasks.

     The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered
     all over the floor.

                              FAUST
               Looks like he helped himself.

     Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised.

     Then Hunter points.

                              HUNTER
               God damn it.

     They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL
     HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
               It escaped.

     They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.

                              ROBY
               Where does that go?

                              FAUST
               All over the ship; we'll have to
               check the charts to know for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Then let's go and do it.

     They head for the door.

                              HUNTER
               Have we got any food at all left in
               the ship?

     They slam the door shut and seal it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of
     ventilator shafts.

                              FAUST
               That one section of the ventilator
               shaft has only two outlets -- you
               notice?  The food storage room on one
               end --

                              HUNTER
               -- And the cooling unit on the
               other.

                              STANDARD
               So it's trapped in between -- now we
               have to drive it out.

                              FAUST
               Poison gas... 

                              HUNTER
               We can't pump poison gas down into
               the cooling unit!  It'll flood the
               whole ship!

                              STANDARD
               The only other thing I can think of
               is for somebody to crawl in there
               and flush it out.

                              ROBY
               Are you crazy?

                              STANDARD
               The man would need protection,
               obviously -- as well as some way to
               drive the thing before him.

                              FAUST
               How about a flamethrower?  That
               wouldn't poison the air.

                              MELKONIS
               So one of us goes into the airshaft
               and drives the thing along --

                              STANDARD
               While the rest of us wait down in
               the cooling unit with the net.

                              HUNTER
               Sounds like a rough one.

                              STANDARD
               Got a better idea?

     Hunter shrugs.

                              ROBY
               So the only question left is: who
               gets to crawl down the airshaft?

                              STANDARD
               Let's be democratic.

     He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one
     of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a
     tiny little ball.

     He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table
     like dice.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Martin, take one.

     Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank.

     Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank.

     Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They
     are both blank.

     They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open it up, Cleave.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower.  Faust is
     helping him.

     Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.

                              FAUST
               Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you
               won't need me, but if you do, I'm
               here.

                              HUNTER
                    (grimly)
               Right.

     Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just
     large enough to crawl through.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     It is completely dark in the shaft.  Hunter reaches up and turns on his
     helmet light.  Then he switches on his radio.

                              HUNTER
               Hey, do you guys read me down there?

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net.  We hear the hum
     of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.  Large airshafts run
     off in different directions.

                              STANDARD
               Yeah, we're getting into position.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Okay, I'm starting now.

     He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel.  He turns a
     corner.

     After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.

     Hunter twitches.  He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE
     DARKNESS.  It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly
     heats up.  Smoke drifts back into his face.  He begins to sweat.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.

                              ROBY
                    (pointing)
               There.  That's where it's got to come
               out.

     He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the
     opening.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               That's a flip-flop gate to channel
               the air, but we can use it to trap
               the thing.

                              STANDARD
               Right now let's keep it closed.

     Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it.  The
     screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got Hunter... and something else
               as well, in front of him.

                              STANDARD
               Are they close?

                              MELKONIS
               They're on the next level up.

                              STANDARD
               Let's get moving with this net.

     They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees.  Up ahead, he can see that
     the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.

     He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his
     flamethrower.

     Then he starts crawling down, head first.

     When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning
     which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.

     Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.

     Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is
     narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering.  He hears a HISSING CRY up
     ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.

     Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal
     flaming burst toward the sound.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Melkonis is staring at his screen.

                              MELKONIS
               They're getting pretty close now.

                              STANDARD
               All right, then -- when it gets to
               the other side of the door, you sing
               out, then drop the door.  Okay?

                              MELKONIS
               Okay.

                              STANDARD
                    (to Roby)
               And you and I will bag it, and then
               we'll take it to the ventral air
               lock, got it?

                              ROBY
                    (tensely)
               Uh-huh.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the
     flamethrower.

                              HUNTER
                    (whispers)
               Hey, you guys.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
                    (whispering)
               I don't think this shaft goes on too
               much farther... anyway it's getting
               pretty hot in here... 

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Okay, our screens show you as being
               near to the opening.  We'll open it
               up, then we'll cue you and you can
               start blasting.  That'll drive it
               right out.  You don't have to go any
               farther.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Good.

     He readies the flamethrower.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
               Okay, get ready.

     He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch
     the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric
     prod.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open the vent, Sandy.

     Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops
     down, opening up the shaft.

     A SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND
     IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN
     OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES.

     Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in
     one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN,
     THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK.

     CLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS
     DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING
     AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT.

     Standard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter
     climbs out of the shaft.

                              HUNTER
               What happened?  Where is it?

     They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the
     creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into
     darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (awed)
               How did it get so big?

                              ROBY
               By eating our food supplies.

                              HUNTER
               Where's Melkonis?

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Faust is still waiting.

                              FAUST
                    (into his communicator)
               Hey, are you guys still there?
               What's going on?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful --
               it's huge now.

                              FAUST
               Right.

     Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks
     the door behind him.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge.

                              HUNTER
               You mean his body was still kicking
               when it ran off with him?

                              ROBY
               It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a
               chicken.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows
     shortly.  They all look blank, stunned.

                              FAUST
               What happened?  Where's Sandy?

                              ROBY
               Dead.

                              FAUST
               Dead!

                              ROBY
               It's monstrous -- it grew, like some
               horrible tapeworm.  We were
               completely unprepared.

                              FAUST
               It's still in the ship?

                              STANDARD
               We'd better seal off the lower
               maintenance level; at least trap it
               there.
                    (throws a switch;
                     circuitry lights up)

                              HUNTER
               At least it can't get up here now.

                              ROBY
               Two down, four to go.

                              STANDARD
                    (angrily)
               What's that supposed to mean?

                              ROBY
               Nothing.

                              HUNTER
               Listen, it sure didn't like this
               flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               That's right -- we can't kill it on
               the ship, but we can at least keep
               it at bay -- and maybe drive it into
               the air lock.

                              HUNTER
               Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.

                              FAUST
               There's some more combustible fuel
               down in the storage lockers next to
               the lounge.
                    (rises)
               I'll go get it.

                              STANDARD
               No, I don't want us separated.

                              FAUST
               You just sealed it off; it can't get
               to that section.

                              ROBY
               Don't count on it.

                              HUNTER
               We sure need this flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               All right... but do not go below
               decks.

                              FAUST
               Right.
                    (heads for the door)

                              STANDARD
               And be right back.

	Faust exits.

                              ROBY
               I think it's time we took a hard
               look at those heiroglyphs.

     Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics
     appear on some of the screens.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Can you make out any pattern in all
               that?

                              STANDARD
                    (baffled)
               Well... yes... there's a pattern... but
               it's meaningless to me.

                              ROBY
               I know it looks like a senseless
               jumble, but if you look closely,
               there are recognizable forms.

                              HUNTER
               Recognizable!  In that?

                              ROBY
               In symbolic form... very stylized... 
               but if you stare at it, you can see
               some of the different creatures
               we've been dealing with.

                              HUNTER
               Well... I suppose that star-shaped
               thing could be the parasite that got
               on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?

                              ROBY
               And right next to it, that oval
               design with the markings -- it's a
               dead ringer for the spore casings.

                              STANDARD
               That next thing there -- six legs,
               tentacles -- that's the thing we saw
               in the food locker.

                              ROBY
               So the next step should be --

                              HUNTER
               -- The big one.  And there it is.

     Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible
     to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.

                              ROBY
               This is all the same creature.  We're
               seeing the different stages in its
               life-cycle.

                              STANDARD
               Then that tomb... must have been some
               kind of fertility temple... where
               they stored their eggs, and maybe
               held mating rituals... 

                              HUNTER
               ... And Broussard got caught in their
               reproductive cycle.

                              ROBY
               You will notice, though, that there
               are no more phases.  Only four forms
               are shown.  After that the pattern
               repeats.

                              STANDARD
               Which presumably means... 

                              ROBY
               ... More spores coming.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt
     halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEEN
     WRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES.

     He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THE
     DIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN.

     Faust hesitates and peers into the lock.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     The creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a
     bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Stealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall
     intercom and speaks into it.

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the lock -- blow the main
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from
     Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence.

                              STANDARD
                    (into intercom)
               What?

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the main air lock.  Blow the
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind
     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature
     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-
     HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.

     FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,
     crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.

     On the wall, a green light goes on:

                         "INNER DOOR CLOSED"

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches
     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.
     IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock
     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into
     the vacuum under pressure.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is
     sucked out toward the lock.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:

                         "CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION"

     After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control
     room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,
     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along
     by the air current.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds
     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt
     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,
     HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.

     Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running
     again.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the
     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his
     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound
     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.

     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a
     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch
     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.

     Done in, he collapses to the floor.

     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of
     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --
     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can
     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking
     underwater.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and
     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping
     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses
     bleed.

     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can
     only hear distant croaks.

     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others
     follow him.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM

     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging
     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen
     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.

     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening
     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL
     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the
     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.

     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.

                              ROBY
               How much oxygen did we lose?

     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.

                              STANDARD
               We've got six hours left.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Does anybody know what happened?

                              ROBY
               I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed
               in the air lock door.  His body held
               it open.

                              STANDARD
               Can we get to him?

                              ROBY
               No, I had to seal off a whole
               section.  We'd lose too much of our
               remaining air if we opened the
               connecting door.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the
     vacuum.  His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.

     The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.

                              ROBY
                    (picking up the cat)
               Poor kitty; puss puss puss.

                              STANDARD
               At least we're rid of the damn
               monster.  It must have been the first
               thing sucked out of the ship.

                              ROBY
               No such luck.  I saw it running down
               one of the corridors.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh no!  We can't fight this thing!
               There's only six hours of air left
               -- we're dead men!

                              STANDARD
               I don't buy that.  There's still time
               to destroy it and get ourselves in
               the freezers.

                              HUNTER
               How?

                              STANDARD
               It's time for drastic remedies.

                              ROBY
               It was time for that a couple days
               ago.

                              STANDARD
               That kind of remark is pointless.
               Now come on -- I want to hear every
               suggestion you can come up with, no
               matter how wild.

                              HUNTER
               We can't kill it on board.  It's huge
               now and must have tremendous amounts
               of that acid in its body.

                              ROBY
               I've got an idea, but you're not
               going to like it.

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
               Okay.  First we shut down all the
               cooling systems on the stardrive
               engines.

                              STANDARD
               That'll blow the ship up.

                              ROBY
               Right... but it'll take a few minutes
               for the engines to overheat and melt
               down the core.  In the meantime, we
               get in the lifeboat and leave the
               ship.

                              HUNTER
               Blow the ship up?

                              ROBY
               And the creature with it.  We can
               make it back to Irth in the
               lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               But the lifeboat can't accelerate to
               light speed.

                              ROBY
               Doesn't matter -- we're already at
               light speed.  And when we get back to
               the Colonies, they'll pick us up in
               the network.

                              HUNTER
               What about all the minerals and
               elements in the cargo hold?  That's
               the only reason we came out here.
               We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd
               be broke.

                              ROBY
               Our lives are more important.
               Anyway, we can take a small amount
               of the most valuable stuff with us
               on the lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               No, it won't work and I just
               realized why.  There's only one
               hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat.
               Only one of us could survive.

                              ROBY
               Yeah... I forgot.

                              STANDARD
               But the idea's good, if we could
               just turn it around somehow.

     They think.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               If we could just get the creature
               into the lifeboat, we could launch
               it into space and blow it up.

                              HUNTER
               Good!  That's good!

                              STANDARD
               We can load the lifeboat up with
               explosives and trigger them
               remotely, once the lifeboat is in
               space.

                              ROBY
               I think it's going to be almost
               impossible to drive it up into the
               lifeboat.

                              HUNTER
               We can use the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               It's not going to work.

                              STANDARD
               You can't say that; I think it's a
               good plan.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower needs more fuel.

                              STANDARD
               Right.  We've got a lot to
               accomplish.  Let's get moving.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship.
     A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.

     LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUS
     SHAPES.  Each container is well packed and labelled.

                              HUNTER
               Which explosive should we use?

                              STANDARD
               I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're
               portable, and they can be radio
               detonated.

     Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like
     broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.

     Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches
     one of them.

                              ROBY
               You know, it's funny -- this stuff
               we went to so much trouble to dig up
               -- this treasure, the paydirt --
               it'll make it back to Irth just fine
               -- even if we're not with it.

                              STANDARD
               Here, carry these.

     Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.

                              ROBY
                    (grabbing at him)
               Hey watch it!

                              STANDARD
                    (grinning)
               It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop
               it.

     They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when
     Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.

                              HUNTER
               Hold it!

     They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and
     points the tracker around.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
                    (nodding up some steps)
               Up there.

     They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks
     up the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               So what do we do?  Do we ignore it
               and finish loading the explosives
               into the boat -- or do we flush it
               out now?

                              STANDARD
               Now.  If we can get it into the boat,
               we won't have to blow it up -- we
               can just eject it into space.

     Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.

     INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL

     Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps.
     Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes.

     Then he continues up.

     EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     The view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up
     the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.

     Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS
     OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the
     movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass
     periodically.

                              STANDARD
                    (shouts)
               You can come up!  It's safe!

     The others come up the steps.

                              ROBY
                    (spying the corpse)
               Oh -- Jesus --

     Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn
     loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.

                              STANDARD
               The ship's gravitational attraction
               must have drawn him back.

                              HUNTER
                    (horrified)
               Should we go outside and bring him
               in?

                              STANDARD
               No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps
               after we've destroyed the thing.

     Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard
     remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and
     ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This
     passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.

     The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the
     equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an
     extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and
     beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount
     of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               Along the base of the walls there.

     They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls
     on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.

                              HUNTER
               This should do it.

                              ROBY
               I should hope so!  And we'd better
               make sure it's pretty far from the
               ship when we blow it.

                              STANDARD
               It will be.

                              HUNTER
                    (surveys the craft uneasily)
               What we really need is some red meat
               in here for bait.

                              ROBY
               Well, if we had some, I'd eat it.
               I'm starting to get hungry.

     By this time, they are exiting.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

                              STANDARD
               Well... now we have to herd that
               thing up here.

                              HUNTER
                    (nervously)
               Whoever's doing the herding is gonna
               have their hands pretty full.  I
               think somebody should stay by the
               lifeboat to slam the door on the
               thing once it's inside, and to serve
               as... as... 
                    (searches for a word)

                              ROBY
               Isn't "bait" the word you used?

                              HUNTER
               Hey look, somebody has to have his
               hands free to lock the creature in
               the lifeboat!

                              STANDARD
               Yes, and maybe launch the boat and
               blow it too... if the others are
               injured.

                              ROBY
               Who gets the privilege?

     INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up.

     ANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see
     it.  It has a big X on it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device
     like a transistor radio.

                              HUNTER
               Just keep your finger off the button
               till she's way away from the ship,
               that's all.

                              ROBY
               Is it armed?

                              HUNTER
               If you press the button right now,
               it will blow the whole nose of the
               ship off.

                              ROBY
               Thanks for the thought.
                    (puts detonator in his
                     breast pocket)

                              STANDARD
               All right, Martin, we'll be in touch
               with you on the communicator.

                              ROBY
               And you'll let me know when you've
               got it coming this way... 

                              STANDARD
               And you stand aside while we drive
               it in, then shut the hatch, launch
               the boat, and --

                              ROBY
               Kablooey.

     Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.

                              STANDARD
               Come on; we haven't much time, air
               is a factor.

     They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower,
     Hunter the tracker.

     Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to
     familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat
     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.

     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY."

     Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got something on the
               tracker... got to be it, it's
               too big for the cat.

     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO
     THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               It's coming from down there.

     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,
     breathing, etc.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP

     Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at
     the tracker.

                              HUNTER
               It must have stopped moving.  I'm not
               getting anything.

                              STANDARD
               Let me go first; you stay behind me.

     Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS
     OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.

     HUNTER SCREAMS.

     Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him
     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.

     Standard doesn't know what to do.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower!

                              STANDARD
               I can't, the acid will pour out!

     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN
     MORTAL AGONY.

     Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires
     -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER
     CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.

     Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of
     flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the
     shrieks and crashing noises.

     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.

                              ROBY
               Hello?  Standard?  Hunter?

     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his
     expression that he expects none.

     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has
     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other
     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He
     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.

     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps
     into the maintenance level.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that
     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he
     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.

     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,
     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.

     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the
     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.

     INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM

     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal
     ladder to the floor.

     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,
     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.

     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.

     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from
     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.

     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close
     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF
     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.

     Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps
     violently.

                              STANDARD
                    (a feeble whisper)
               Kill me... 

                              ROBY
                    (sickened)
               What did it do to you?

                              STANDARD
                    (moves his head slightly)
               Look... 

     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles
     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller
     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE
     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... 

                              ROBY
                    (looking around for a tool)
               I'll get you out of there.

                              STANDARD
               No... don't... 

                              ROBY
               But I can save you -- get you to the
               Autodoc!

                              STANDARD
               No good... it's eaten too much of
               me... 

                              ROBY
                    (in horror)
               What can I do?

                              STANDARD
               Kill me... 

     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look
     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and
     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and
     scrambles back up the ladder.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.
     At length, he regains control of himself.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED

     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters
     rolling past in the infinite distance.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a
     little oxygen tank on it.

                              ROBY
               Kitty go bye-bye.

     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss
     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in
     front.  It YOWLS.

     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the
     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal
     cannisters.

                              ROBY
                    (reading from labels)
               What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how
               about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of
               it.  This'll buy us an island on some
               nice planet.

     Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries
     back up the steps.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine
     room, containing the massive stardrive engines.

     He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the
     engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one
     by one.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  The cooling units for the
               stardrive engines are not
               functioning!  Engines will overload
               in 4 minutes, 50 seconds!  Attention!

     Finally Roby closes the last switch.  Shaking with nervousness, he
     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby hurries on, listening to the siren.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overheat and
               main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30
               seconds!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed.  Hands full,
     he starts to enter the connecting passageway.

     INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAY

     THE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THE
     LIFEBOAT.

     It HISSES and starts toward him.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws
     the switch.  The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the
     lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               4 minutes!

     Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button.  The thing can
     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.

     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding
     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the
     ship as he sprints for the engine room.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes, 30 seconds!

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.  The room is full of
     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in
     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.

     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit
     switches.

     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes!

     Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.

                              ROBY
               Computer!  I've turned all the
               cooling units back on!  What's wrong?

                              COMPUTER
               The reaction has proceeded too far.
               The core has begun to melt.  Engines
               will overload in 2 minutes, 35
               seconds.

     A look of terror comes onto Roby's face.  He turns and runs from the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time
     up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               2 minutes!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where
     the lifeboat is berthed.  He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward
     the passageway.

     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.

     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.
     Then he advances on the passageway.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the
     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on
     by the siren and the computer:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               90 seconds!

     He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his
     head into the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     HIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is
     EMPTY.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway.
     There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               60 seconds!

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and
     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the
     seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button.

     EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE
     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK."

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates
     away from the mother ship.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of
     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly
     circumstances.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the
     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches
     his head down over it.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,
     until it is barely a point of light.

     THEN IT BLOWS UP.

     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL
     DIRECTIONS.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling
     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.

     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of
     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed
     in orange light.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away
     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of
     his ship and friends.

     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN
     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.

     The cat SCREECHES.

     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of
     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.

     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.

     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on
     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any
     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,
     with the door standing open.

     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.

     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker
     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face
     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that
     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is
     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.

     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It
     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.

     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE
     GLASS.

     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the
     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.

     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the
     catbox.

     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull
     it on.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see
     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing
     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it
     into a crevice in the wall.

     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the
     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the
     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.

     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.
     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.

     Again he raps on the glass.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

                              ROBY
               Try a little of this, you fucking
               bastard.

     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT
     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.

     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid
     begins to flow from the wound.

     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a
     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.

     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into
     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel
     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT
     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.

   

   

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing
     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't
     let go.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and
     yanks it.

     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END
     OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.

     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,
     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is
     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.

     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:

                              "RAM JETS"

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the
     creature is wriggling.  THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN
     SHUT OFF.

     INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a
     writhing, smoking, foaming mass.

     As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats --
     then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all
     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling
     into infinity.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER

     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He
     seems calm and composed, almost cheerful.  The cat purrs in his lap.

                              ROBY
                    (dictating)
               ... So it looks like I'll make it
               back to the Colonies on schedule
               after all.  I should be to the
               frontier in another 250 years or so,
               and then with a little luck the
               network will pick me up.  I'm not as
               rich as I was a couple days ago --
               but I'm not exactly broke either.
               Incidentally, I did manage to
               salvage one souvenir out of this
               whole mess.

     He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls
     out the ALIEN SKULL.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Poor Yorick here should go at least
               partway toward proving I'm not a
               crank.  I wish it was him we'd met in
               the first place -- things might have
               turned out different.

     He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               This is Martin Roby, executive
               officer, last survivor of the
               commercial vessel SNARK, signing off.
               Come on, cat, let's go to sleep.

     Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder.  Then he rises and,
     carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open.

     He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against
     his chest.  With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER
     HIM.

                Story by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett


                      Screenplay by Dan O'Bannon





                                                                       1976






                              SYNOPSIS

     En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the
     starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language,
     originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.

     Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange
     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.

     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-
     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and
     cannot be removed.

     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing
     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not
     kill it on the ship.

     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,
     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been
     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose
     on the ship.

     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears
     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's
     bizarre life cycle.

     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the
     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a
     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which
     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

FADE IN:

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital
     displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future.

     Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic
     machinery chuckles softly to itself.

     Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken.
     Circuits close, lights blink on.

     CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the
     machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal:

     INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT

     A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with
     instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid.

     Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER
     COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers.

     FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the
     freezers pop open.

     Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.

                              ROBY
               Oh... God... am I cold... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Is that you, Roby?

                              ROBY
               I feel like shit... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, it's you all right.

     Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.

                              FAUST
                    (groans)
               Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead.

                              BROUSSARD
               You look dead.

                              MELKONIS
               The vampires rise from their graves.

     This draws a few woozy chuckles.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (shakes his fist in the
                     air triumphantly)
               We made it!

                              HUNTER
                    (not fully awake)
               Is it over?

                              STANDARD
               It's over, Hunter.

                              HUNTER
                    (yawning)
               Boy, that's terrific.

                              STANDARD
                    (looking around with a grin)
               Well, how does it feel to be rich
               men?

                              FAUST
               Cold!

     This draws a LAUGH.

                              STANDARD
               Okay!  Everybody topside!  Let's get
               our pants on and get to our posts!

     The men begin to swing out of the freezers.

                              MELKONIS
               Somebody get the cat.

     Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

     This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation.  There
     are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by
     viewscreens, all blank for the moment.

     There are seats for four men.  Each chair faces a console and is
     surrounded by a dazzling array of technology.

     STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding their
     seats.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.

                              ROBY
                    (putting down the cat)
               Cattle ranch!

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm not kidding.  You can get one if
               you have the credit.  Look just like
               real cows, too.

                              STANDARD
               All right, tycoons, let's stop
               spending our credit and start
               worrying about the job at hand.

                              ROBY
               Right.  Fire up all systems.

     They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles.  The control
     room starts to come to life.  All around the room, colored lights
     flicker and chase each other across glowing screens.  The room fills
     with the hum and chatter of machinery.

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, you want to give us some
               vision?

                              MELKONIS
               Feast your eyes.

     Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches.  The
     strip of viewscreens flickers into life.

     On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (after a pause)
               Where's Irth?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, scan the whole sky.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  On the screens the images all begin to pan.

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a
     starfield.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.  This camera is remote controlled,
     turning silently on its base.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted on
     the HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT.

     When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP
     "SNARK," hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a
     background of glimmering stars.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, contact traffic control.

     Melkonis switches on his radio unit.

                              MELKONIS
               This is deep space commercial vessel
               SNARK, registration number E180246,
               calling Antarctica air traffic
               control.  Do you read me?  Over.

     There is only the HISS OF STATIC.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (staring at a screen)
               I don't recognize that constellation.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, plot our location.

     Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               I got it.  Oh boy.

                              STANDARD
               Where the hell are we?

                              BROUSSARD
               Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We
               haven't even reached the outer rim
               yet.

                              ROBY
               What the hell?

     Standard picks up a microphone.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we
               are not home.  Our present location
               seems to be only halfway to Irth.
               Remain at your posts and stand by.
               That is all.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, I've got something here on my
               security alert.  A high priority from
               the computer... 

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons)
               Computer, you have signalled a
               priority three message.  What is the
               message?

                              COMPUTER
                    (a mechanical voice)
               I have interrupted the course of the
               voyage.

                              ROBY
               What?  Why?

                              COMPUTER
               I am programmed to do so if certain
               conditions arise.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, this is Captain Standard.
               What conditions are you talking
               about?

                              COMPUTER
               I have intercepted a transmission of
               unknown origin.

                              STANDARD
               A transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               A voice transmission.

                              MELKONIS
               Out here?

     The men exchange glances.

                              COMPUTER
               I have recorded the transmission.

                              STANDARD
               Play it for us, please.

     Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A
     STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN
     LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls
     silent.

     The men all stare at each other in amazement.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what language was that?

                              COMPUTER
               Unknown.

                              ROBY
               Unknown!  What do you mean?

                              COMPUTER
               It is none of the 678 dialects
               spoken by technological man.

     There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.

                              STANDARD
                    (silencing them)
               Just hold it, hold it!
                    (glares around the room)
               Computer: have you attempted to
               analyze the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               Yes.  There are two points of salient
               interest.  Number one: it is highly
               systematized, indicating intelligent
               origin.  Number two: certain sounds
               are inconsistent with the human
               palate.

                              ROBY
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Well, it's finally happened.

                              MELKONIS
               First contact... 

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, can you home in on that beam?

                              MELKONIS
               What's the frequency?

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what's the frequency of
               the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               65330 dash 99.

     Melkonis punches buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got it.  It's coming from
               ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds,
               declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

                              STANDARD
               Dell -- show me that on a screen.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll give it to you on number four.

     Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a
     small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               That's it.  Let me straighten it out.

     He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in
     the center.

                              STANDARD
               Can you get it a little closer?

                              BROUSSARD
               That's what I'm going to do.

     He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers.

                              MELKONIS
               It's tiny!

                              STANDARD
               Any rotation?

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah.  Two hours.

                              STANDARD
               Gravity?

                              BROUSSARD
               Point eight six.  We can walk on it.

     Standard rises.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, get the others up to the
               lounge.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and
     FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.

                              MELKONIS
               If it's an S.O.S., we're morally
               obligated to investigate.

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

                              HUNTER
               I don't know.  Seems to me we came on
               this trip to make some credit, not
               to go off on some kind of side trip.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (excited)
               Forget the credit; what we have here
               is a chance to be the first men to
               contact a nonhuman intelligence.

                              ROBY
               If there is some kind of alien
               intelligence down on that planetoid,
               it'd be a serious mistake for us to
               blunder in unequipped.

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, we're equipped --

                              ROBY
               Hell, no!  We don't know what's down
               there on that piece of rock!  It
               might be dangerous!  What we should
               do is get on the radio to the
               exploration authorities... and let
               them deal with it.

                              STANDARD
               Except it will take 75 years to get
               a reply back.  Don't forget how far
               we are from the Colonies, Martin.

                              BROUSSARD
               There are no commercial lanes out
               here.  Face it, we're out of range.

                              MELKONIS
               Men have waited centuries to contact
               another form of intelligent life in
               the universe.  This is an opportunity
               which may never come again.

                              ROBY
               Look --

                              STANDARD
               You're overruled, Martin.  Gentlemen
               -- let's go.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, I want greater magnification.
               More surface detail.  I want to see
               what this place looks like.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll see what I can do.

     He jabs his controls.  The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD THE
     PLANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.

                              STANDARD
               It's out of focus.

                              ROBY
               No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud
               layer.

                              MELKONIS
               My God, it's stormy for a piece of
               rock that size!

                              ROBY
               Just a second.
                    (punches buttons)
               Those aren't water vapor clouds;
               they have no moisture content.

                              STANDARD
               Put ship in atmospheric mode.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - OUTER SPACE

     The great dish antenna on the SNARK folds down against the main body
     of the ship, and other parts flatten out, until the ship has assumed
     an aerodynamic form.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Dell, set a course and bring us in
               on that beam.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK's engines cough into life, and send it drifting toward the
     distant dot that is the planetoid.

     CAMERA APPROACHES THE PLANETOID, until it looms large on screen.  It is
     turbulent, completely enveloped in dun-colored clouds.

     The SNARK drops down toward the surface.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Activate lifter quads.

                              BROUSSARD
               Activated.  Vertical drop checked.
               Correcting course.  On tangential
               course now, orbiting.
                    (brief pause as he
                     studies his instruments)
               Crossing the terminator.  Entering
               night side.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - IN ORBIT

     Beneath the orbiting SNARK, night's curtain rolls across the planet.

     Descending at an angle, the SNARK drops down into the thick atmosphere
     of the planetoid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.

                              STANDARD
               Turn on navigation lights.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK"

     Hydroplaning down through the pea-soup atmosphere, a set of brilliant
     lights switches on, cutting through the dust, but hardly improving
     visibility.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               Approaching point of origin.  Closing
               at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing.
               Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are
               directly above the source of the
               transmission.

                              STANDARD
               What's the terrain down there?

                              BROUSSARD
               Well, line of sight is impossible
               due to dust.  Radar gives me noise.
               Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared --
               noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There.
               Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.

                              STANDARD
               Is it solid?

                              BROUSSARD
               It's... basalt.  Rock.

                              STANDARD
               Then take her down.

                              BROUSSARD
               Drop begins... now!  Fifteen
               kilometers and dropping... twelve... 
               ten... eight and slowing.  Five.
               Three.  Two.  One kilometer and
               slowing.  Lock tractor beams.

     There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders.

                              ROBY
               Locked.

                              BROUSSARD
               Kill drive engines.

     The engines fall silent.

                              ROBY
               Engines off.

                              BROUSSARD
               Nine hundred meters and dropping.
               800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers
     above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.

     Landing struts unfold like insect legs.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               And we're... down.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the
     panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT.

                              BROUSSARD
               Jesus Christ!

     The lights come back on again.

                              STANDARD
               What the hell happened?

                              ROBY
                    (hits a switch)
               Engine room, what happened?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Just a minute, hold it, I'm
               checking.

                              ROBY
               Has the hull been breached?

                              BROUSSARD
               Uh... 
                    (scans his gauges)
               No, I don't see anything.  We've
               still got pressure.

     There is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then:

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are
               clogged with dust.  We overheated and
               burned out a whole cell.

                              STANDARD
                    (strikes his panel)
               Damn it!  How long to fix?

                              ROBY
                    (into microphone)
               How long to fix?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Hard to say.

                              ROBY
               Well, get started.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Right.  Talk to you.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take a look outside.  Turn the
               screens back on.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black.

                              BROUSSARD
               Can't see a blessed thing.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute
     darkness around it.

     THE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING
     LIGHTS.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              STANDARD
               Kick on the floods.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     A ring of FLOODLIGHTS on the ship come to life, pouring blinding light
     out into the night.

     They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and
     clouds of blowing dust.  The wind shrieks.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              ROBY
               Not much help.

     Standard stares at the dark screens.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we can't go anywhere in this
               darkness.  How long till dawn?

                              MELKONIS
                    (consults his instruments)
               Well... this rock rotates every two
               hours.  The sun should be coming up
               in about 20 minutes.

                              BROUSSARD
               Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see
               something then.

                              ROBY
               Or something will be able to see us.

     They all look at him.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT (MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE)

     The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the
     darkness and the storm.  MAIN THEME MUSIC BEGINS, EXTREMELY OMINOUS.

     THE TITLE APPEARS:

                              ALIEN

     RUN TITLES.

     Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES.  The
     silhouette of the SNARK becomes visible, like some strange insect
     crouching motionless on the barren plain.  The floods shut off.  Dense
     clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and
     reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.

     END MAIN TITLES.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange
     dust.

     PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.  The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, and
     Melkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffee
     and staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust.

                              ROBY
               There could be a whole city out
               there and we'd never see it.

                              BROUSSARD
               Not sitting on our butts in here,
               that's for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any
               response yet?

                              MELKONIS
                    (pulls off his earphones)
               Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn
               transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've
               tried every frequency on the
               spectrum.

                              BROUSSARD
               Are we just going to sit around and
               wait for an invitation?

     Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his console
     and speaks into the mike.

                              ROBY
                    (into mike)
               Hello, Faust!

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Yeah!

                              ROBY
               How's it coming on the engines?

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speaking
     into a wall intercom.

                              FAUST
               I never saw anything as fine as this
               dust... these cells are all pitted on
               a microscopic level.  I have to
               polish these things smooth again, so
               it's going to take a while.  Okay?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.
                    (puts down the mike)

                              STANDARD
               Sandy... how far are we from the
               source of the transmission?

                              MELKONIS
               Source of transmission is to the
               northeast... about 300 meters.

                              ROBY
               Close... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Close enough to walk to!

                              STANDARD
               Martin, would you run me an
               atmospheric?

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons and
                     consults his panels)
               10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... 
               and some trace elements.

                              STANDARD
               Nontoxic... but unbreathable.
               Pressure?

                              ROBY
               Ten to the fourth dynes per square
               centimeter.

                              STANDARD
               Good!  Moisture content?

                              ROBY
               Zero.  Dry as a bone.

                              STANDARD
               Any microorganisms?

                              ROBY
               Not a one.  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Anything else?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we won't need pressure suits,
               but breathing masks are called for.
               Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of
               portable unit that we can use to
               follow that transmission to its
               source?

                              MELKONIS
               No problem.

                              BROUSSARD
               I volunteer for the exploration
               party.

                              STANDARD
               I heard you.  You want to break out
               the side arms?

     INTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DAY

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock.  They all wear gloves,
     boots, jackets, and pistols.

     Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut,
     sealing them into the lock.

     They all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks.

                              STANDARD
                    (adjusting the radio on his
                     mask)
               I'm sending.  Do you hear me?

                              BROUSSARD
               Receiving.

                              MELKONIS
               Receiving.

                              STANDARD
               All right.  Now just remember: keep
               away from those weapons unless I say
               otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Read you, Chaz.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Open the outer door.

     Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams
     into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE
     WIND OUTSIDE.

     A mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it
     hits the ground.

     Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet.
     Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock.

     The men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at
     their clothes.  Nothing can be seen.

                              STANDARD
               Which way, Sandy?

     Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder.

                              MELKONIS
                    (pointing)
               That way.

                              STANDARD
               You lead.

     Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the
     others.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Martin.  We're on our way.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his
     console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a
     screen.

                              ROBY
               Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you
               on my board.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Good.  I'm getting you clear too.
               Let's just keep the line open.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men plough their way through a limbo of yellow dust and
     shrieking wind.  With their rubbery masks and deliberate movements,
     they look like deep-sea divers at the bottom of a murky ocean.

     Melkonis leads the column, following the compass on the direction
     finder.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Can't see more than three meters in
               any direction out here.  We're
               walking blind, on instruments.

     They wade on, following Melkonis.  Abruptly he halts.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               What's wrong?

                              MELKONIS
               My signal's fading.

     He studies the direction finder.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is listening intently to the dialogue from the helmet radios.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               It's the dust, it's interfering... 

     His concentration is so great that he does NOT NOTICE HUNTER COMING UP
     BEHIND HIM.

                              MELKONIS (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... Hold it, I've got it again.  It's
               over that way.

     Standing DIRECTLY BEHIND ROBY, Hunter speaks.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening?

     Startled out of his wits, Roby GASPS and whirls around to face Hunter.

                              ROBY
                    (startled silly)
               Hell!

     Hunter stares at Roby, whose momentary terror dissolves into
     embarrassed anger.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men push their way through the storm.  Melkonis stops again,
     studies the direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               It's close, real close.

                              STANDARD
               How far?

                              MELKONIS
               We should be almost on top of it.  I
               just can't quite... 

     Suddenly, Broussard grabs Standard's arm and points.  The others stare
     in the direction he is pointing.

     REVERSE ANGLE - THEIR POINT-OF-VIEW

     Through the dense clouds of swirling dust we can just barely make out
     some kind of HUGE SHAPE.

     As we watch, the dust clears slightly, REVEALING A GROTESQUE SHIP
     RISING FROM THE SHIP LIKE SOME GIGANTIC TOADSTOOL.  It is clearly of
     non-human manufacture.

     ANGLE ON THE MEN

     They are struck dumb by the sight of the craft.  Finally, Standard
     finds his voice.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, uh, we've found it.

                              ROBY
                    (sharply -- over, filtered)
               Found what?

                              STANDARD
               It appears to be some sort of
               spacecraft.  We're going to approach
               it.

     They start toward the alien ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               There are no signs of life.  No
               lights... no movement... 

     Roby and Hunter are listening with hypnotic concentration.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               We're, uh, approaching the base.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF TOADSTOOL SHIP - DAY

     A strangely shaped DOOR yawns open at the base of the ship.  Dust and
     sand have blown in, filling the lower part of the entrance.

     With great caution, the men approach the entrance and group around it.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Appears to be a door hanging open,
               the entrance is clogged with debris.

                              BROUSSARD
               Looks like a derelict.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to
               hold the conversation to a minimum
               from here on.

     INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DAY

     The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness,
     spewing dust.  In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless
     shapes.

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the
     doorway.  They switch on flashlight-like devices called "DATASTICKS",
     and step in.
Carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct
     machinery.

                              MELKONIS
               Air lock?

                              STANDARD
               Who knows?

                              BROUSSARD
               Let's try and find the control room.

     As they move their lights around, they can see that the walls,
     ceiling, and machinery are FULL OF HUGE, IRREGULAR HOLES.

                              MELKONIS
               Look at these holes.  This place
               looks like Swiss cheese.

     Broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.

                              BROUSSARD
               This hole goes up several decks --
               looks like somebody was firing a
               military disintegrator in here.

     They all peer up the hole into darkness.

                              STANDARD
               Climbing gear.

     Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it.
     He aims it up into the hole and fires.

     The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire.  There
     is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll go first.

                              STANDARD
               No, you'll follow me.

     Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and
     presses a button.  With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the
     hole, using his feet for leverage where he can.

     Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP

     This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the
     hole.

     Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a
     beam through the hanging dust.

     Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own
     light.  At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole.

     THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM.  The beams are clearly visible as columns
     of light in the floating dust.  They reveal heavy, odd shapes.

     Broussard stumbles over something.  He shines his light down on it.

     It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings.
     Broussard stands it upright.  It has a round opening in the top, and is
     empty.

     Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock.  Their lights have
     illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON,
     SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR.

     They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it.  IT IS A
     GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.

                              MELKONIS
               Holy Christ... 

     Standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton
     is seated.  He moves his light closer and peers at the panel.

                              STANDARD
               Look at this... 

     They approach.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Something has been scratched here... 
               into the veneer.  See?

     Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a
     sharp instrument, is a small triangle:
Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room.  As the
     beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES.

     Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.

                              MELKONIS
               LOOK OUT, IT MOVED!

     Standard knocks his hand down.

                              STANDARD
               Keep away from that gun!

     Standard shoulders himself in front of the others.  Then, slowly, he
     begins to move toward the far side of the room.

     They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it.
     There is a machine.  On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back
     and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Just machinery.

                              BROUSSARD
               But functioning.

     Melkonis looks down at his direction finder.

                              MELKONIS
               That's where the transmission is
               coming from.

     He throws a switch on the direction finder -- with a crackle and a
     hum, the UNEARTHLY VOICE fills their earphones.

                              BROUSSARD
               A recording.  A damned automatic
               recording.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - SUNSET

     SINISTER ANGLE ON THE SNARK.  As we watch, the sunlight turns the color
     of blood, and then the sun is down, leaving murky blackness in its
     wake.  The ring of floodlights on the ship flares into life, feebly
     combatting the darkness and the storm.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the conference table, watching
     holographic pictures projected onto a screen.  These are photos taken
     by their "datasticks" (flashlight/cameras).

     Standard is commenting on the changing slides.

                              STANDARD
               ... This is the control room... 

     Two or three pictures click onto the screen in succession, showing the
     suited men standing against banks of machinery.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... Some details of the control
               room... 

     The SKELETON appears on the screen.  The men react with mutters.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is the skeleton... another
               view of the skeleton... the
               transmitting device... 

     The triangle that was cut into the alien's console appears.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... This is a closeup of the triangle
               we found scrawled on the console in
               front of the skeleton... 

     Standard changes the slide.  The screen goes white.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               ... And that's it.

     He turns off the projector and brings the lights up.

                              HUNTER
               Phenomenal.  Staggering.

                              BROUSSARD
               We've got to go back and take a lot
               more pictures, holograph
               everything.

                              MELKONIS
               And bring back as much physical
               evidence as possible, too.  The rest
               of the skeleton.  Some of the
               machinery.  Written records, if there
               are any.

     Roby is slumped in his chair.  He has said nothing.

                              STANDARD
               Martin?

                              ROBY
               I agree.  This is the single most
               important discovery in history.

                              STANDARD
               But?

                              ROBY
               What killed it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, that thing's been dead for
               years.  Maybe hundreds of years.  The
               whole planet's dead.

                              FAUST
               The way I figure it, they landed
               here for repairs or something, then
               they couldn't take off again.  Maybe
               the dust ruined their engines.  They
               set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody
               came.  So they died.

                              ROBY
               He died.

                              FAUST
               What?

                              ROBY
               Not they... he... 

     They all turn to look in the direction of Roby's nod.  CAMERA MOVES
     OVER TO REVEAL THE ALIEN SKULL SITTING ON A TABLE.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               ... There was only one skeleton.

     There is a moment of silence.

                              STANDARD
               Jay... how's it coming on the
               repairs?

                              FAUST
               Well... I'm going to have to blow the
               engines out... 

                              STANDARD
               And when will you be ready to do
               that?

                              FAUST
               Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.

                              STANDARD
               Then why the hell are you sitting
               around here?

                              FAUST
               Right.

     The men rise and begin to disperse, but Roby remains seated, deep in
     thought, staring at the skull.  Melkonis lingers in the room with him.

                              MELKONIS
               And there sits man's first contact
               with intelligent life in the
               universe.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON THE SHIP, its spotlights cutting into the gloom.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     A room throbbing with power, enormous pulsing engines capable of
     releasing unimaginable energies.

     Faust has a complicated arrangement set up at the base of one of the
     engines, with spotlights on it.  He is wearing goggles and thin gloves.

                              FAUST
               You ready up there?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Broussard and Melkonis are seated at their consoles, conversing with
     Faust while they watch their instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure, we're ready.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

                              FAUST
               Okay.  I'm going to start the
               extraction procedure now.

     He pauses to wipe his brow.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the
     photographic slides on the screen.  He is clicking slowly through them.
     He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it.

     The alien's misshapen skull is sitting on the table next to him.  He
     picks it up, holds it up to the screen for comparison, and studies it.

     Standard appears in the doorway.

                              STANDARD
               Alas, poor Yorick.

     Roby STARTS, puts down the skull.  Standard sits at the table.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (nodding at the screen)
               Find anything we missed?

                              ROBY
                    (shrugs)
               I don't even know what I'm looking
               for.

                              STANDARD
               Still worried?

                              ROBY
               Oh well... you know me.

                              STANDARD
               I've always respected your opinion,
               Martin.  If something worries you, it
               worries me.

     Roby reaches over and changes the slide, to the one of the CRUDELY
     DRAWN TRIANGLE ON THE ALIEN CONTROL PANEL.

                              ROBY
               What would you say that was supposed
               to mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well... it's obviously intentional... 
               some kind of attempt at
               communication... maybe it's a symbol
               that means something to them... 

                              ROBY
               But why draw it on the wall?

     Roby switches off the projector, sits up, and rubs his face wearily.

     He rises and goes to the coffee machine.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (picking a hair out of
                     the coffeepot)
               This ship is full of cat hair.

                              STANDARD
               Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as
               the engine's fixed --

     BEEP!  The communicator interrupts Standard.  He leans across and
     presses the button.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               This is Chaz.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come
               topside for a minute?

                              STANDARD
               What's up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Well, the sun just came up again,
               and it seems the wind's died down.
               It's as clear as a bell outside.
               There's something I think you ought
               to see.

                              STANDARD
               I'm on my way.

     He and Roby head for the door.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Broussard is alone in the control room when Standard and Roby arrive.

                              STANDARD
               What is it?

                              BROUSSARD
               Take a look.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The dust no longer blows.  The day is crisp, clear, and silent.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               I was scanning the horizon to see
               what I could pick up.  Look there, on
               that screen.

                              STANDARD
               What is it, I can't --

     BLIP!  Broussard enlarges the image.

     The screen now shows a TAPERING STONE PYRAMID on the horizon.

     They all stare at the image for a long moment.  The silhouette of the
     PYRAMID IS INSTANTLY SUGGESTIVE OF THE SCRAWLED TRIANGLE in the alien
     ship.
Standard presses the nearest communicator and speaks into the grille.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz.  All hands topside.
               Now.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

     ANGLE ON A VIEWSCREEN.  It shows the PYRAMID on the horizon.  CAMERA
     PULLS BACK to reveal all the men, sitting and standing around the
     room.

                              STANDARD
               Doesn't seem much doubt about it,
               does there?

                              MELKONIS
               That creature sure must have
               considered it important... using his
               last strength to draw it... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe they built it.

                              FAUST
               As what?

                              BROUSSARD
               A marker for buried instrumentation?

                              HUNTER
               Or a mass grave.

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe the rest of the crew is in
               there -- in some kind of suspended
               animation, waiting to be rescued.

                              MELKONIS
               It wasn't necessarily built by them.

     On the screens, a puff of DUST blows in front of the pyramid.

                              ROBY
               Here comes the dust again.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     WITH A SHRIEK, THE DUST STORM RETURNS, completely obscuring the SNARK.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Well, does anyone else agree with
               Martin that we should not explore
               it?

     Everyone looks around the room, but no one volunteers.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Then the sooner we get moving, the
               better.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     LONG SHOT OF THE STONE PYRAMID, dust blowing in front of it.  It is a
     crumbling, ancient edifice, made of eroded grey stones, windowless,
     tapering toward the top.

     Standard, Broussard, and Melkonis, wearing the protective suits,
     approach the pyramid.  As they draw near, it becomes clear that the
     pyramid is roughly 50 feet tall.

                              STANDARD
               We can't make out any details or
               features yet... but it's definitely
               too regular for a natural
               formation... 

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby and Hunter are present.  They are listening to Standard's VOICE ON
     THE RADIO.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               ... There's one thing I can say for
               sure though... 

     BUZZZZZ!  Standard's voice is DROWNED OUT BY STATIC.

                              ROBY
               Now what's wrong?

                              HUNTER
               I've completely lost their signal.

                              ROBY
               Can you get them back?

                              HUNTER
               I'm trying.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The three men come to the base of the massive structure.  Dust and sand
     have piled thickly around the crumbling, grey stones that form the
     base.

                              MELKONIS
               This looks ancient.

                              STANDARD
               Can't tell -- these weather
               conditions could erode anything,
               fast.

     They walk around the base.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's no entrance.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe the entrance is buried.  Could
               be under our feet.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe there is no entrance; the
               thing may be solid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Well, there ought to be some way we
               can get through to them --

     The INTERCOM BEEPS.  Faust's voice is heard.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna
               charge up the engines for a minute,
               okay?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.

     A LOUD, POWERFUL THROBBING BEGINS, drowning out all other sounds, as
     the engines are tested.

     A light on Roby's panel is FLASHING.  We can see that it is the
     COMPUTER ALERT.

     Irritably, Roby throws the switch.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Yes!

                              COMPUTER
               I have a temporary sequence on the
               monitor --

                              ROBY
               Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!

     He puts an earphone to his ear and switches the computer's voice over.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Go ahead!

     There is a PAUSE while Roby listens to the computer.  His eyes widen.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               You mean... you've translated it?

     Another PAUSE as he listens to the earphone.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Well come on, come on!  What does it
               say?

     Another PAUSE.  Roby's face changes; he looks CHILLED TO THE BONE.  His
     mouth works.

     Abruptly, THE ENGINES SHUT OFF, LEAVING A RINGING SILENCE.

                              HUNTER
                    (looking over at Roby)
               What?  What was that?

                              ROBY
               The computer just translated the
               goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S.
               It was a warning.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              BROUSSARD
               Maybe we can get in by the top.

                              STANDARD
               You want to try?

                              BROUSSARD
               Sure.

     Broussard takes out the graplon-gun, and fires the hook up toward the
     top of the pyramid.  It catches.  He clips himself to the wire.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               You guys just wait down here till I
               say it's okay to come up.

     Broussard turns on the climbing device, and begins to walk up the side
     of the pyramid.

     OMINOUS ANGLES showing Broussard climbing the pyramid, the dust
     blowing, the wind shrieking.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     The peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair.  Broussard arrives at
     the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones.

                              BROUSSARD
               There's a hole at the top.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Can we come up?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (over, filtered)
               No, it's too small, only room enough
               for one person.

                              STANDARD
               Can you see anything in the hole?

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard leans over and looks into the hole.  He sees only blackness.

     Freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on
     the "flashlight" function, and shines it down into the hole.

                              BROUSSARD
               I can see... partway down.  It just
               goes down like a stovepipe.  Smooth
               walls.  I can't see the bottom --
               light won't reach.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Faust comes trotting up the steps, a questioning look on his face.

                              FAUST
               Yes?  What is it?

                              ROBY
               Jay, we've got a problem.  I was
               wondering if there was any way you
               could shortcut the repairs and give
               us immediate takeoff capability.

                              FAUST
                    (quickly)
               Why, what's wrong?

                              ROBY
               The computer's translated the alien
               signal, and it's kind of alarming.

                              FAUST
               What do you mean?

                              ROBY
               It couldn't translate the whole
               thing, only three phrases.  I'll just
               read it to you the way I got it:
                    (reads from a strip of paper)
               "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO
               NOT LAND... "
                    (looks up at the others)
               And that's all it could translate.

     EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Hanging from the lip of the hole, Broussard is unclipping gear from
     his belt.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Dell, you want to come down, we can
               figure out where to go from here.

                              BROUSSARD
               No, I want to go in.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     Standard and Melkonis exchange a glance.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Dell, but just for a
               preliminary look-around.  Don't
               unhook yourself from your cable.  And
               be out in less than ten minutes.

               Right.

     Broussard has rigged a tripod across the mouth of the hole.  He
     unspools a couple feet of wire from the device, and attaches the end
     of it to his chest unit.

     He climbs over the lip and drops into the hole.  He is now hanging by
     the wire, with his head and shoulders out of the hole.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Okay, I'm in the mouth of the
               chimney now, and I'm starting down.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Take care.

     Broussard activates the climbing unit and lowers himself down into the
     hole.

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Bracing his feet against the rough stone wall of the vertical tunnel,
     Broussard switches on his datastick and points it down into the
     depths.

     The beam penetrates only thirty feet or so, then is lost in darkness.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's noticeably warmer in here.  Warm
               air rising from below.

     He starts down, paying out the line and moving down in short hops,
     pushing off each time with his feet.

     He stops to catch his breath.  His breathing rasps loudly in his
     helmet.

     A little sunlight filters down from above.  Looking up, he can see the
     mouth of the hole, a glowing spot of light.

     Standard's voice comes over his earphones.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Are you okay in there?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (gasping for breath)
               Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom
               yet.  Definitely a column of warm air
               rising; it keeps the shaft clear of
               dust.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               What was that Dell, I lost you, do
               you read me?

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't
               talk now.

     He kicks off and continues down, taking longer and longer hops as he
     gains confidence.

     Pausing for a moment to regain his breath, he shines the light on his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               I'm way below ground level.

                              STANDARD
               What'd he say?

                              MELKONIS
               I couldn't make it out -- too much
               interference.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby and Hunter.

                              HUNTER
               I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area
               around the pyramid is dead to
               transmission.  I think we should go
               after them.

                              ROBY
               No.

                              HUNTER
               What do you mean, no?

                              ROBY
               We're not going anywhere.

                              HUNTER
               But they don't know about the
               translation!  They could be in danger
               right now.

                              ROBY
               We can't spare the personnel.  We've
               got minimum takeoff capability right
               now.  That's why Chaz left us on
               board.

                              HUNTER
               Why, you chickenshit bastard --

                              ROBY
               Just can that crap!  I'm in command
               here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's
               leaving this ship!

     INTERIOR - PYRAMID - DAY

     Broussard resumes his downward climb.  SUDDENLY, HIS FEET LOSE THEIR
     PURCHASE AS THE WALLS OF THE SHAFT DISAPPEAR.

     The tunnel has reached its end.  Below him is an unfathomable,
     cavernous space.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (huffing and puffing)
               Tunnel's gone -- cave or something
               below me -- feels like the tropics
               in here; air is warm and humid... 
                    (consults his instruments)
               ... high oxygen content, no dust,
               it's completely breathable --

     Puffing with exertion, he releases his purchase on the stone walls and
     begins to lower himself on power.  Now he is dangling free in darkness,
     spinning slowly on the wire as the chest unit unwinds.

     Finally, his feet hit bottom.  He grunts in surprise and almost loses
     his balance.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - DAY

     Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of
     sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above.  Around is
     solid darkness.

     He flashes his datastick around.  The beam reveals that he is in a
     stone room.  STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls.  They have
     a primitive, religious appearance.  Row after row of pictograms stretch
     from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language.  Huge
     religious symbols dominate one wall.

     Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque
     monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.

                              BROUSSARD
               It's unbelievable!  It's like some
               kind of tomb... some primitive
               religion!  Hey, is anybody there?  Do
               you read me?  Standard!

     Annoyed, Broussard yanks off his breathing goggles, and leaves them
     hanging around his neck.  He takes a deep breath of the wet air.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - LATE AFTERNOON

     Standard and Melkonis are standing around nervously.

                              STANDARD
               If we don't hear from him soon, I
               think we better go in after him.

                              MELKONIS
               Sun will be down in a minute.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - LATE AFTERNOON

     Face bare, Broussard approaches the center of the room, which is
     dominated by a large, broad pedestal.  On the pedestal are ROWS OF
     LEATHERY URNS OR JARS, EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE BROUSSARD STUMBLED ACROSS
     IN THE ALIEN SHIP -- EXCEPT THESE ARE ALL SEALED.

     He walks around the urns, studying them.  They all have sealed lids.  He
     shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it.

     He lifts his mask radio to his lips.

                              BROUSSARD
               I don't know if you can hear me, but
               the place is full of large bottles
               or jars, just like the one we found
               on the other ship -- except these
               are all sealed.  Also they're soft to
               the touch.

     He peers more closely at the leathery object.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Another funny thing -- I just put my
               hand on it, and now there are these
               raised areas appearing where my
               fingertips were.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF PYRAMID - DAY

     THE SUN DROPS BELOW THE HORIZON, throwing the landscape into gloom.
     Standard and Melkonis switch on their lights.

                              STANDARD
               Let's go.

     He attaches his chest unit to the wire and starts up.

     INTERIOR - TOMB - NIGHT

     Broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the
     wall.  They depict stylized drawings of strange monsters.

     He pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he
     turns back to the "urn" he was examining -- BUT NOW THERE IS A HOLE IN
     THE TOP OF IT.

     He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn."  There lies
     the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole.  He picks it up and
     studies it.  It appears more organic than artificial; the inside
     surface is spongy and irregular.

     Then he turns the light to the now-open "urn."

     He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, AND WITH
     SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES
     ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD.

     With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the
     thing with his hands.
EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT

     The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top,
     lights bobbing in the darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (puffing with exertion)
               Here's his line.  We can haul him out
               of there if we have to.

                              MELKONIS
               It'll yank him right off his feet if
               he's not expecting it.  The line
               could get tangled in something.

                              STANDARD
               But what can we do?  He's out of
               radio contact.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we should just wait a few more
               minutes.

     Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole.

                              STANDARD
                    (making up his mind)
               No, I told him to be out in ten
               minutes.  It's been much longer.
               Let's get him out of there.

     Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the
     tunnel.  He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which
     Broussard's line dangles.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               The line's slack.  Christ, do you
               think the idiot unhooked himself?

     He switches on the winch motor.  With a whine, it begins to reel the
     line in.  After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the
     motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               There, it caught!

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still coming up, or is it
               hooked on something?

                              STANDARD
               No, it's coming.

                              MELKONIS
               Can you see anything?

     Standard shines his light down into the hole.

                              STANDARD
               No, I can't see far enough.  The
               line's moving, though.

     For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid,
     saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls.
     Then Standard shines his light back down in.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I can see him!  Here he comes!

     The winch begins to LABOR HEAVILY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Get ready to grab him!

     Broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the
     wire.  Standard reaches for him -- then RECOILS SHARPLY.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Look out!  There's something on
               his face!

     Melkonis attempts to come to his aid.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               Don't touch him, watch it!

     In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally
     regain their balance.  They shine their lights on Broussard.

     He appears to be completely unconscious -- AND THE OCTOPUS THING IS
     STILL WRAPPED AROUND HIS FACE, MOTIONLESS.

                              MELKONIS
               Oh God, oh God no.

                              STANDARD
               Help me -- I'm going to try to get
               it off.

     With his gloved hands, Standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to
     pull it from Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It won't come -- it's stuck.

                              MELKONIS
               What is it?

                              STANDARD
               How the hell should I know?  Come on,
               give me a hand, let's get him out of
               there!

     The two men grapple with Broussard's limp body, lifting him from the
     hole.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Roby and Hunter are sitting moodily, silent.  There is a long moment
     while nothing is said, then:

                              HUNTER
               I've got 'em!  They're back on my
               screens!

                              ROBY
                    (leaps to his feet)
               How many?

                              HUNTER
               Three blips!  They're coming this
               way!

     Roby grabs a microphone.

                              ROBY
                    (into mike)
               Hey, can you guys hear me?

               Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming
               back!

                              ROBY
               Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen,
               there's been a new development --

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Can't talk now; Broussard's injured.
               We'll need some help getting him
               into the ship.

     Roby collapses into a chair, suddenly limp with apprehension.  He's
     feared something like this all along, and now it has begun to happen.

                              ROBY
                    (to himself)
               Oh no.

                              HUNTER

               Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the
               main air lock!

     Hunter dashes from the room.

     Roby remains where he is, seated at his console.  He is stunned, his
     mind racing.  CAMERA MOVES IN ON HIS FACE.

     Hunter comes racing down the steps and hurries up to the inner lock

                    (into intercom)
               Martin, I'm by the inner lock door!

     Faust comes running up, covered with grime.

               What the hell's going on?

                              HUNTER
               Don't know -- Broussard got hurt
               somehow.

                              FAUST
               Hurt!  How?

                              HUNTER
               Don't know -- maybe we'll be real
               lucky and he just broke his neck.
                    (a beat)
               I knew we shouldn't of come down
               here.

     Roby is seated alone in the room, listening to the transmission from
     Standard and Melkonis.

     Roby leans forward and speaks into the microphone.

               Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?

                    (over, filtered)
               It's some kind of organism, it's
               attached itself to him.  Let us in.

     Roby does not reply.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (over, filtered)
               You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer

                              ROBY
               Chaz, if it's an organism, and we
               let it in, the ship will be
               infected.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We can't leave him out here, open
               the door.

                              ROBY
                    (urgently)
               Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken
               every rule of quarantine.  If we
               bring an organism on board, we won't
               have a single layer of defense left.

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is an order!  Open the
               door!

     Hating it, Roby leans forward and throws the switch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK - NIGHT

     A RED LIGHT goes on, on a console on the wall.  The whine of a large
     servo is heard, followed by a solid metallic CLUNK.

                              HUNTER
               Outer door's open.

     After a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another
     CLUNK.  The outer door has closed again.  The red light goes off.

     The inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through,
     carrying the sagging body of Broussard.  A cloud of choking dust
     follows them out of the lock.

                              STANDARD
                    (pulling off his mask)
               You men stay clear, there's a
               parasite on him.

     Hunter and Faust RECOIL.

                              HUNTER
               Oh -- God -- oh --

                              FAUST
               Is it alive?

                              STANDARD
               I don't know but don't touch it.
               Give us a hand here, let's get him
               up to the Autodoc.

     Hunter and Faust move in carefully to help with the limp burden.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     One of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the
     medical room, carrying Broussard.

     Revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with
     machinery.  The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed,
     which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.

                              STANDARD
               Help me, come on, let's get him up
               here.

     They slide the man onto the bunk.

                              HUNTER
               That thing, God almighty, didn't you
               try to get it off him?

                              STANDARD
               It wouldn't come.

     Standard yanks off his gloves.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Medical gloves.

     They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull
     them on.

     Gingerly, they approach Broussard.

     Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing
     on Broussard's face.  He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to
     pull it free.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               It's really on there tight.

                              FAUST
               Here, let me try.

     Faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip
     of one of the tentacles.  Squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his
     weight.

                              STANDARD
                    (grabbing Faust's hands)
               Stop it, you're tearing his face.

     A trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek.

                              MELKONIS
               It's not coming off -- not without
               his whole face coming off too.

                              STANDARD
               Let's let the machine work on him.

     Efficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a
     couple of switches on the wall.  The machine lights up, and Broussard
     is sucked into the slot in the wall.

     He is visible inside.  The machine immediately sprays a cloud of
     disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light.

     A bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different
     parts of his body.  Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.

     ROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.

     Standard turns and looks at him.  For a long moment, the two men regard
     each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE
     FACE.

     The others are shocked.

                              HUNTER
               Hey now, what is this?

                              STANDARD
               Ask him.

                              ROBY
                    (slowly puts his hand
                     to his cheek)
               I understand why you did that.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

                              MELKONIS
               He wouldn't open the lock; he was
               going to leave us out there.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I
               mean, you brought the goddamn thing
               in here.  Maybe you deserve to get
               slapped.

                              FAUST
                    (embarrassed)
               Excuse me, I've got work to do.

     Faust exits.

                              HUNTER
               I keep my mouth pretty much shut,
               but I don't like hitting.

                              ROBY
                    (to Standard)
               I guess I had it coming.  Let's call
               it settled.

     After a hard stare at Roby, Standard gives him a curt nod and turns
     his attention to the machinery.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
                    (slowly)
               Would somebody fill me in?

                              STANDARD
               He went into the pyramid alone.  We
               lost radio contact with him.  When we
               pulled him out, it was on his face.
               It won't come off, not without
               injuring him.

                              HUNTER
               Where did it come from?

                              MELKONIS
               He's the only one that knows that.

                              HUNTER
               How does he breathe?

     They study the monitors.

                              MELKONIS
               Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.

                              HUNTER
               Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth
               are blocked.

                              STANDARD
               Let's look inside his head.

     Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray
     image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER
     TORSO.

     The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face.  In X-ray, the
     creature is a maze of complicated biology.  But the shocking thing is
     that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open,
     and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED
     INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.

                              ROBY
               Look at that.

                              HUNTER
               What is it -- I can't tell
               anything --

                              ROBY
               It's some kind of organ -- it's
               inserted some kind of tube or
               something down his throat.

                              HUNTER
                    (turning sick)
               Oh... God... 

     Hunter bends over and RETCHES.

                              ROBY
               I think that's how it's getting
               oxygen to him.

                              HUNTER
               It doesn't make any sense.  It
               paralyzes him... puts him into a
               coma... then keeps him alive.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't expect to understand a life
               form like this.  We're out of our
               back yard.  Things are different
               here.

                              HUNTER
               Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we
               can't leave the damn thing on him.

                              MELKONIS
               We don't know what might happen if
               we tried to kill it.  At least right
               now it's keeping him alive.

                              HUNTER
               How about cutting it off?  We can't
               pull it loose, but we can cut off
               everything but the bottom layer,
               where it's stuck to his face.

                              STANDARD
               You're right... we can't stand here
               and do nothing.

     Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head.
     Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves.  Finally, he presses a switch
     and Broussard slides back out of the booth.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled in his mask)
               Somebody give me a scalpel.

     Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall,
     and carefully passes it to Standard.

     Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his
     hand till he has a decent grip on it.  Then he flicks a little button
     with his thumb.  The scalpel begins to hum.

     Standard advances on the parasite.  The others draw back nervously.
     Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and
     holds it inconspicuously at his side.

     Standard bends over the parasite.  Carefully, he touches the scalpel to
     the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the
     back of Broussard's head.

     Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue.
     Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               I've made an incision... it's not
               reacting... but some kind of
               yellowish fluid is leaking out of
               the wound... 

     The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to
     Broussard's head.  Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of
     smoke curls up from the stain.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (muffled)
               Hold it, this stuff's smoking!

     The others REACT nervously.

     By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has
     dripped down onto the floor below.  The metal floor begins to bubble
     and sizzle, and more smoke rises.

     The men start to COUGH.

                              MELKONIS
               God, that smoke's poisonous!

                              HUNTER
                    (pointing)
               It's eating a hole in the floor!

     Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the
     corridor outside, coughing their lungs out.

     Standard, who is masked, remains.  Frantically, he attempts to put a
     bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and
     in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves.  They
     begin to smoke.

     Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves.
     Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

                              STANDARD
               That stuff's eating right through
               the metal!  It's going to eat through
               the decks and right out through the
               hull!

     By this time Standard has started to run for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Followed by the others, Standard frantically clangs down the stairs to
     the level below.

                              STANDARD
               There!  Look!

     A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling.  It oozes down and
     drips to the floor.

     It bubbles on the floor.

                              MELKONIS
               Jesus, what can we put under it?

     Standard and Hunter charge down the stairs to the level below.

     INTERIOR - LEVEL BELOW

     Standard and Hunter move cautiously down the corridor, looking up at
     the ceiling.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               There.  Should be coming through
               about there.

                              HUNTER
               Careful, don't get under it!

     INTERIOR - LEVEL ABOVE

     Roby and Melkonis crouch by the spot on the floor where the acid
     sizzles.

                              MELKONIS
               Christ, that stinks.

     Roby fishes a pen out of his pocket and probes into the hole in the
     floor.

                              ROBY
               Seems to have stopped penetrating.

     Hunter comes charging up the steps.

                              HUNTER
               What's happening up here?

                              ROBY
               I think it's fizzled out.

     Hunter approaches and looks.  Roby straightens up, starts to put the
     pen back in his pocket, then changes his mind and stands holding it by
     the end.

                              MELKONIS
               I never saw anything like that in my
               life... except molecular acid.

                              HUNTER
               But this thing uses it for blood.

                              MELKONIS
               Hell of a defense mechanism.  You
               don't dare kill it.

     Standard comes up the stairs.

                              STANDARD
               It's stopped?

                              MELKONIS
               Yes, thank heaven.

                              STANDARD
               We're just plain lucky.  That could
               have gone right through the hull --
               taken weeks to patch it.

                              MELKONIS
               Reminded me of when I was a kid and
               the roof leaked -- everybody running
               for the pots and pans.

                              ROBY
               My God, what about Broussard?

     They turn and run up the stairs.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     They all come into the room (Roby carrying the partially melted pen).
     Broussard is still motionless on the bunk, with the thing on his face.

                              ROBY
               Did it get on him?

     Standard approaches and peers at Broussard's head.

                              STANDARD
               No, thank God... just missed him.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it still dripping?

                              STANDARD
                    (examining it)
               It appears to have healed itself.

                              HUNTER
               It makes me sick to see him like
               that.

                              MELKONIS
               Isn't there some way we can get it
               off him?

                              STANDARD
               I don't see how.  But let's do what
               we can for him.

     Standard presses a button, and Broussard slides back into the
     diagnostic coffin.  He presses more buttons, and the displays light up
     again, showing different parts of Broussard's body.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think we'd better get some
               intravenous feeding started.  God
               knows what that thing is leaching
               out of him.

     Standard operates some controls, and the machine begins to invade
     Broussard's body, sliding needles into him.

                              ROBY
                    (studying the screens)
               Look there, what's that stain on his
               lungs?

     The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's
     chest.  In the center, the stain is completely opaque.

                              MELKONIS
               It appears to be a heavy fluid of
               some sort... it blocks the X-rays... 

                              ROBY
               That tube must be depositing it in
               him.

                              MELKONIS
               Could be some kind of venom, or
               poison... 

                              HUNTER
               This is horrible.

                              ROBY
               Hey!  what about the film?

                              STANDARD
               What film?

                              ROBY
               Broussard had film in his datastick,
               didn't he?  We can see what happened
               to him.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     Again we are watching slides in the darkened room.  This time Standard,
     Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs
     taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.

     The camera reveals the "urns."  The climax of the sequence of stills
     comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA --
     and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to
     show a series of meaningless blurs.  Then the reel ends.

                              HUNTER
               That must have been when he got it.

                              ROBY
               The same thing must've happened to
               the creatures on the other ship... 
               except they took one of those jars
               on board, and opened it there.

                              MELKONIS
                    (clicks back through the
                     slides to a picture of
                     one of the "urns")
               At first I thought they were jars
               too, or artifacts anyway.  But
               they're not.  They're eggs, or spore
               casings.  Let's go back to the
               heiroglyphics.

     CLICKETYCLICKETYCLICK -- Melkonis accelerates through the slides in a
     blur, stopping at the one he wants -- which shows a strip of
     heiroglyphs on the wall of the tomb.

                              STANDARD
               I personally can't make any sense
               out of it... 

     CLICK.  CLICK.  Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing
     different angles on the glyphs.

                              MELKONIS
               It's a crude symbolic language --
               looks primitive.

                              HUNTER
               You can't tell -- that kind of stuff
               could represent printed circuits... 

                              STANDARD
               That sounds a little fanciful... 

                              MELKONIS
               Primitive pictorial languages are
               based on common objects in the
               environment, and this can be used as
               a starting point for translation... 

                              ROBY
               What common objects?

                              HUNTER
               Listen, hadn't somebody better check
               on Broussard?

                              STANDARD
                    (rising)
               I'll do it.  The rest of you
               continue.

                              HUNTER
                    (rising)
               I'll come with you.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INFIRMARY

     Standard and Hunter come down the passageway.

                              STANDARD
               You know, it's fantastic -- the
               human race has gone this long
               without ever encountering another
               advanced life form, and now we run
               into a veritable zoo.

                              HUNTER
               What do you mean?

                              STANDARD
               Well, those things out there aren't
               the same, you know -- the spaceship
               and the pyramid.  They're from
               different cultures and different
               races.  That ship just landed here --
               crashed like we did.  The pyramid and
               the thing from it are indigenous.

                              HUNTER
               How could anything be indigenous to
               this asteroid?  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Maybe it wasn't always dead.

     They arrive at the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     The door slides open, and they step into the room.  Hunter activates
     the bed, and it slides out of the wall.

     THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.

                              HUNTER
               It's gone.

     They rush to Broussard's prone form.  THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HIS
     FACE.

     Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing.  HIS FACE IS
     COVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.

                              HUNTER
               Now we're in for it.

                              STANDARD
               The door was closed.  It must still
               be in here.

     They immediately grow very tense.  Hunter starts edging toward the
     door.  Standard grabs his arm.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               No, don't open the door.  We don't
               want it escaping.

                              HUNTER
                    (very nervous)
               Well, what the hell good can we do
               in here?  We can't grab it -- it
               might jump on us --

                              STANDARD
               Maybe we can catch it.

     Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               As long as we're careful not to
               damage it... 

     Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly
     around the room.  There are very few places to hide.

     He bends down and peers under the bunk.

     As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE
     THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.

     He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE.  THE PARASITE DROPS TO
     THE FLOOR.

                              STANDARD
                    (leaping back)
               Shit!

     But the thing is not moving.  It lies motionless on the floor, its
     tentacles curled up.  Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.

     Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and
     takes a long probe from the wall.  He prods the thing; it does not
     respond.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               I think it's dead.

     With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite
     into the tray.  Then he quickly closes the lid.

     INTERIOR - LABORATORY

     Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a
     stainless steel table, with a bright light on it.  It is belly-side up.

     Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.

                              STANDARD
               Look at these suckers -- no wonder
               we couldn't get it off him.

                              ROBY
               Is that its mouth?

                              MELKONIS
               More likely that organ -- the tube-
               like thing -- fits up in there.

     With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy
     aperture.  Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.

                              ROBY
               Ugh.

     Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.

                              STANDARD
               Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme
               something to grab it with!

     It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.

     Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at
     Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes
     the thing in the tongs.

     It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Christ!  Let's get it out of here!

     Carrying the thing, he heads for the door.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     The men run down the passageways, Standard carrying the dripping thing
     in the tongs.  It leaves little smoking droplets on the floor.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     They come running up to the airlock.  Roby stabs the button and the
     inner door slides open.  By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is
     already on the intercom:

                              ROBY
                    (shouts into intercom)
               For Chrissake, open the main lock!

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     Roby stumbles in as the inner door closes; and with a heavy whine, the
     thick surface door rumbles open.  Orange sunlight billows in, followed
     by the inevitable dust.

     Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all.

     EXTERIOR - BASE OF SHIP - DAY

     The parasite hits the ground and begins to sink into the dust,
     smouldering and fuming.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK - DAY

     The outer door rolls shut.

                              ROBY
                    (slumping against the
                     wall)
               My God, it's lethal even when it's
               dead!

     Melkonis gets down on his knees and studies the small burn-holes in
     the floor.

     Standard opens the inner door and steps out into the corridor.  There,
     he activates the wall intercom and punches out a combination.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              HUNTER
                    (over intercom,
                     filtered)
               Yes?

                              STANDARD
               How's Broussard?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               He's running a fever.

                              STANDARD
               Still unconscious?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               Yes.

                              STANDARD
               Can you do anything for him?

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               The machine will bring his
               temperature down.  His vital
               functions are strong.

                              STANDARD
               Good.

     He switches off the intercom.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (suddenly exhausted)
               I need some coffee.

     He turns and walks away.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The cat is strolling around as Roby and Melkonis drop into seats;
     Standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.

                              MELKONIS
               These day and night cycles are
               totally disorienting.  I feel like
               we've been here for days, but it's
               only been how long?

                              ROBY
                    (stroking the cat)
               About four hours.

                              STANDARD
                    (staring into his coffee
                     cup)
               I'm sorry to say it looks like you
               were right in the first place,
               Martin.  We never should have landed
               here.

                              ROBY
               Look, I'm not trying to rub
               anybody's nose in anything.  The
               important thing is just to get away
               from here as fast as possible.

                              STANDARD
               I can't lean on Faust any harder --
               he's been working non-stop on the
               engines.

                              ROBY
               If we knew exactly what happened to
               the beings on the other ship --

                              MELKONIS
               We do know that.

                              ROBY
               Yeah?

                              MELKONIS
               They never made it off the planet.
               The parasites won.

     This brings a CHILLY SILENCE.

                              ROBY
               Where did the parasites come from?

                              STANDARD
               They seem native to the planet.  It's
               got an atmosphere and a dense
               gravity.  It's dead now, but once it
               must have been fertile.

                              MELKONIS
               No.  It's just too small to support
               fauna as big as the parasites.  If
               there were a native ecology, it
               would have to be microscopic.

                              ROBY
               Couldn't the pyramid have been built
               here by space travellers?

                              STANDARD
               Too primitive.  It's a pre-
               technological construction.  That
               slab was engineered by an Iron-Age
               culture at best.

                              MELKONIS
               They're from a dead civilization;
               they're spores from a tomb.  God
               knows how long they've been here.

                              ROBY
               I think we better take another look
               at those heiroglyphs.

     Suddenly the door opens and Faust sticks his head in.  He is covered
     with dirt and grime.

                              FAUST
               Hey, guess what?

                              STANDARD
               What?

                              FAUST
               The engines are fixed.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK's engines cough and then with a ROAR BEGIN TO BELCH OUT
     STREAMS OF SUPERHEATED AIR, cutting through the tulgy dust.

     The ship roars and vibrates like a huge beast, capable of unlimited
     power.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     They are all at their posts.

                              STANDARD
               Switch on tractor beams.

     There is a hair-tingling ELECTRICAL HUM which permeates the whole
     ship, and it begins to float, like a cork in water.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Lock tractor beams.

     The pitch of the hum changes, and the ship levels itself.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Retract landing struts.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     The ship is hovering above the ground on beams of shimmering force.
     The landing struts fold up under the belly of the ship.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Take us up.

                              ROBY
                    (into intercom)
               Up one kilometer, Jay.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The SNARK begins to levitate up into the sky, on the beams of light.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Switch on lifter quads.

     A POWERFUL, DEEP THROBBING BEGINS.  THE SHIP VIBRATES.

     EXTERIOR - "SNARK" - DAY

     The hovering SNARK begins to accelerate through the choking
     atmosphere.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Engage artificial gravity.

     Roby throws a switch, and the ship LURCHES.

                              ROBY
               Engaged.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take her into an escape orbit.

     The men get busy with switches.

                              ROBY
               I'm altering our vector now; should
               give us an easy escape velocity --

     A HUGE TREMOR RUNS THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              ROBY & MELKONIS
                    (in concert)
               What was that?

     In answer, THE COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               This dust is getting clogged in the
               intakes again!

                              STANDARD
               Just hold us together till we're in
               space, that's all!

     The pitch of the engines changes, deepens.

     EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY

     The SNARK swoops up at an acute angle into the boiling clouds.
     Visibility is zero.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is pulling on a gasmask, because the engine chamber is beginning
     to fill with dust.  He turns on a huge exhaust unit which begins to
     suck up some of the dust.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     On the screens, nothing but clouds.  Then, ANOTHER TREMOR SHUDDERS
     THROUGH THE SHIP.  The men no longer speak; their expressions are grim,
     set, and sweating; they are watching their instruments.  Periodically
     they mutter technical instructions to each other.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

     Abruptly the ship CLEARS THE TOP OF THE CLOUD LAYER AND BURSTS OUT
     INTO STAR-SPRINKLED SPACE, trailing a wake of dust behind it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They all CHEER.

                              ROBY
                    (pounds his panel)
               We made it!  Damn, we made it!

                              STANDARD
               You bet we made it.  Martin, set
               course for Irth and accelerate us
               into stardrive.

                              ROBY
               With great pleasure.

     Roby begins to punch buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I feel like an escapee from Hell.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP AT LIGHT SPEED - LATER

     The ship's speed is so great that there is perceptible movement in the
     universe all around.

     There is a strange corona effect which causes the stars approaching
     the ship to appear blue, and the receding ones to be red.  This is
     redshift, made visible because of their incredible velocity.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE

     They are unstrapping.

                              ROBY
               That's the part that always makes me
               feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we
               accelerate into light speed.

                              STANDARD
               Quit complaining; we're in space.

     They rise and head out of the room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     As they walk along.

                              STANDARD
               I think the best thing to do with
               Broussard is to just freeze him as
               he is.  It'll arrest the progress of
               his disease, and he can get complete
               medical attention when we get back
               to the Colonies.

                              ROBY
               We'll have to go into quarantine,
               maybe for quite a while.

                              STANDARD
               That's okay, he can remain in
               hypersleep until they're ready to
               treat him.

     They enter the infirmary.

     INTERIOR - INFIRMARY

     As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP
     in BED -- AWAKE.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (hoarsely)
               ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some
               water... 

     Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water.  Broussard gulps it
     down in a swallow.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               More.

     Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard,
     who greedily consumes the entire thing.  Then he sags, panting, on the
     bunk.

                              STANDARD
                    (softly)
               How do you feel, Dell?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (weakly)
               Wretched.  What happened to me?

                              STANDARD
               Don't you remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly
               remember my name.

                              ROBY
               Are you in pain?

                              BROUSSARD
               Not exactly, just feel like
               somebody's been beating me with
               rubber hoses for about six years.

     Melkonis laughs at this remark.  Broussard smiles faintly at him.

                              STANDARD
               Hell, you're in great shape, you've
               got your sense of humor back!

                              BROUSSARD
               God I'm hungry.

                              ROBY
               Dell, what's the last thing you can
               remember?

                              BROUSSARD
               ... I don't know... 

                              ROBY
               Do you remember the pyramid?

                              BROUSSARD
               No.  Just some horrible dreams about
               smothering.  Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               We're going home.  We're in
               hyperspace.

                              MELKONIS
               We're going into the freezers now.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm really starving; can we get some
               food before we go into the freezers?

                              STANDARD
                    (laughs)
               I think that's a pretty reasonable
               request.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions
     greedily.  The cat eats from a dish on the table.

                              HUNTER
               Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a
               straight shot back to the Colonies,
               and then we can start taking bids on
               the paydirt.  Any bets on the top
               bid?

                              FAUST
                    (chewing)
               Well, we should at least be able to
               each buy our own planet.

     They all CHUCKLE.

                              MELKONIS
               I'm going to write a book about this
               expedition.  I'm going to call it
               "The Snark Log."

                              STANDARD
                    (stiffly)
               The commander normally has first
               publication rights.

                              MELKONIS
               Maybe we could write it together.

                              ROBY
               First thing I'm going to do when we
               get back is eat some biological
               food.

                              MELKONIS
               What's the matter, you don't like
               this stuff?

                              ROBY
               Tastes like something you'd feed a
               chicken to make it lay more eggs.

                              STANDARD
               Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag
               than this, but I've had worse too,
               if you know what I mean.

                              FAUST
               I kind of like it.

                              ROBY
               You like this shit?

                              FAUST
               It grows on you.

                              ROBY
               You know what they make this stuff
               out of?

                              FAUST
                    (annoyed)
               Yes, I know what they make it out
               of, so what?  It's food now.  You're
               eating it.

                              ROBY
               I didn't say it was bad for you,
               it's just kind of sickening, that's
               all.

                              HUNTER
               Do we have to talk about this kind
               of crap at the dinner table?

     Suddenly, unexpectedly, BROUSSARD GRIMACES AND GROANS.

                              STANDARD
               What's wrong?

                              BROUSSARD
                    (his voice straining)
               I don't know... I'm getting these
               CRAMPS!

     The others stare at him in alarm.  Another GROAN is torn from his lips.
     He clutches the edge of the table with his hands, his knuckles
     whitening.

                              STANDARD
               Breathe deeply.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (screaming)
               OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD!

                              ROBY
               What Dell -- what?

     Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is
     trembling violently from head to foot.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (incoherent shriek)
               OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!

     A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.

     THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS
     TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A
     MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.

     Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table.  The cat spits and
     bolts.

     The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's
     chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood
     -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and
     scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.

     When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped.
     Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest,
     spouting blood.  The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with
     blood and slime.

                              HUNTER
               Oh, no.  Oh, no.

                              FAUST
               What was that?  What the Christ was
               that?

                              MELKONIS
               It was growing in him the whole time
               and he didn't even know it!

     Slowly, they gather around Broussard's gutted corpse.

                              ROBY
               That thing used him for an
               incubator!

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped
     body tumbles silently out.

     AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into
     eternity.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     The entire remaining crew is walking toward the bridge.

                              MELKONIS
               We can't go into hypersleep with
               that thing running around loose.

                              HUNTER
               We'd be sitting ducks in the
               freezers.

                              ROBY
               But we can't kill it.  If we kill it,
               it will spill all its body acids
               right through our hull and out into
               space.

                              FAUST
               Shit... 

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to catch it and eject it
               from the ship.

                              MELKONIS
                    (sighs)
               Well, I kind of hate to point it
               out, but all our supplies are based
               on us spending a strictly limited
               amount of time out of suspended
               animation... and as you know, we used
               up most of that time in harvesting.

                              STANDARD
               We've got about a week left, right?

                              HUNTER
               And then we run out of food and
               oxygen.

                              FAUST
               The water will still recycle.

                              ROBY
               We won't need it then.

                              STANDARD
               All right, so that's what we've got.
               A week.  It's plenty of time.

                              ROBY
               But if we haven't caught it in a
               week, then we have to go into the
               freezers anyway.

     They enter the bridge.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               So does anybody have any
               suggestions?

                              FAUST
               We could put on our pressure suits
               and blow all the air out of the
               ship.  That would kill it.

                              STANDARD
               No, we can't afford to lose that
               much oxygen.  We're going to have to
               flush it out.

                              MELKONIS
               How?

                              STANDARD
               Room by room, corridor by corridor.

     No one likes this thought.

                              MELKONIS
               And what do we do when we find it?

                              STANDARD
               We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we
               had a really strong piece of net, we
               could bag it.

                              FAUST
               We could cut a section out of that
               metallite netting.  It won't hold up
               to that acid, but aside from that
               it's pretty strong.

                              ROBY
               We have to avoid injuring it.  What
               we really need is some electric
               animal prods.

                              HUNTER
               I think I could cobble something
               together.  A long metal rod with a
               battery in it.  Give it a hell of a
               shock.

                              STANDARD
               Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm
               issuing a standing order: from this
               moment forth, every one of us will
               wear protective garments, including
               helmets.  Let's get down to the
               locker and change.

     They start for the exit.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The SNARK continues on its way through the weird vortex of hyperspace.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone.  He is
     garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot
     policeman, including clear plastic helmet.

     He reaches a corner and turns.  But this new passageway has a different
     gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical
     wall.

     He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside-
     down.  He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down
     them.

     INTERIOR - VENTRAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space.
     He also wears the protective suit.

     Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome.  It is dark and eerie
     here, under the stars of interstellar space.  A few glowing panels
     provide the only illumination.

                              STANDARD
               I thought I'd find you here.

                              MELKONIS
               I was thinking of a line from an old
               poem: "Water, water everywhere, but
               not a drop to drink."  All that space
               out there, and we're trapped in this
               ship.

                              STANDARD
               That's the one about the albatross,
               right?

                              MELKONIS
               We can't even radio for help; the
               carrier wave wouldn't reach its
               destination till long after we'd
               died and turned to dust.  We are
               utterly, absolutely alone.  Can
               anybody really visualize such a
               scale of distances?  Halfway across
               Creation... 

                              STANDARD
               We came out there, we'll go back.  A
               long time by the clock, but a short
               time to us.

                              MELKONIS
               Time and space have no meaning out
               here.  We're living in Einsteinian
               equation.

                              STANDARD
               I can see you're putting your spare
               time to good use.
                    (leans forward and taps
                     him on the knee)
               Let me tell you something: you keep
               staring at hyperspace for long
               enough, they'll be peeling you off a
               wall.  I've seen it happen.

                              MELKONIS
                    (smiles at him)
               We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We
               even have our own special diseases.

                              STANDARD
               Come on -- let's go above and see
               how they're coming with the gear.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole crew has assembled.  Faust is unfolding several yards of
     shimmering metallic netting.

     Hunter hands out five thin rods, like metal broom handles.

                              HUNTER
               These have portable generators in
               them.  They're insulated down to here
               -- just be careful not to touch the
               end.

     He demonstrates by touching the tip of one of the rods to a metal
     object.  A blue spark leaps.

                              FAUST
               Might even incinerate the damn
               thing.

                              STANDARD
                    (sharply)
               I hope not.

                              HUNTER
               Don't worry, it won't damage it,
               it'll just give it a little
               incentive.

                              STANDARD
               How do we locate the creature?

                              FAUST
               With these.

     He picks up a small portable unit.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Tracking device.  You set it to
               search for a moving object... It
               hasn't got much range, but when you
               get within a certain distance, it
               starts beeping.

     Standard takes the device and studies it.

                              STANDARD
               These will be very useful.  At least
               we won't have to go digging around
               in closets with our bare hands.  All
               right, here's the battle plan: we're
               going to break into two teams and
               start systematically covering the
               ship.  Whoever finds it first,
               catches it in the net and ejects it
               from the nearest airlock.  Clear?

                              ROBY
               Even simple.

     Standard shoots him a vicious look, then continues:

                              STANDARD
               For starters, let's make sure the
               bridge is safe.

     Faust takes the device and turns it on.  He scans it around the room.

                              FAUST
               It's clear.

                              STANDARD
               All right -- Roby and Melkonis will
               go with Faust.  Hunter and I will
               make up the second team.

     They start doling out the equipment.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               We'll all carry communicators.  We
               want to keep in constant touch.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Melkonis and Roby carry the net, while Faust walks directly behind it,
     carrying the tracking device.  He continually scans it from side to
     side.

                              FAUST
               Nothing yet... nothing... we can move
               pretty fast as long as there's
               nothing on the tracker.

     INTERIOR - OTHER CORRIDORS

     Standard and Hunter move silently along.  Standard is forced to serve a
     double function, carrying one edge of the net and the tracker as well.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Roby's team is moving at a fairly brisk pace, when:

                              FAUST
               Hold it.

     Faust's tracker is BEEPING, and a small light flashes.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               I've got something.

     Immediately, they grow very tense and start looking around.

                              ROBY
               Where's it coming from?

                              FAUST
                    (peers closely at tracker
                     and frowns)
               Machine's screwed up, I can't tell.
               Needle's spinning all over the dial.

                              MELKONIS
               Is it malfunctioning?

     Faust turns the tracker on its side, and the needle stabilizes.

                              FAUST
               No, just confused.  It's coming from
               below us.

     They all look down at their feet.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal
     stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.

     The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the
     ceiling.  The effect is ugly and confining.

     They stop at the foot of the stairs and move into position, spreading
     the net across the corridor.

                              ROBY
               Okay.

                              FAUST
                    (looking at tracker and
                     nodding down the passageway)
               That way.

     They begin to walk down the passageway, footsteps clanging on the raw
     metal flooring.  It is extremely dark.

                              ROBY
               What happened to the lights?

                              FAUST
               Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to
               replace 'em.

     They switch on the helmet lights.

     CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF TURNINGS, AND THEN:

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
               Hold it.

     They all stop quickly, almost stumbling.

                              FAUST (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               It's within 4 meters.

     Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand.  Faust,
     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of
     approaching the source of the signal.

     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any
     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.

     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one
     wall.

     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets
     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,
     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod
     inside.

     WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF
     THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.

     Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:

                              ROBY
                    (very annoyed)
               Oh, hold it!

     They open the net and release the creature.  IT IS THE CAT.  Hissing and
     spitting, it scampers away.

                              MELKONIS
               We're making fools of ourselves!

     Roby's COMMUNICATOR BEEPS.

                              ROBY
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got it up here!  It's trapped!
               Get up here fast!

                              ROBY
               Where are you?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Food-storage room!

                              ROBY
               We're coming!

     They dash for the stairs.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby, Faust, and Melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive
     at:

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Standard and Hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.

                              HUNTER
               We saw it inside and slammed the
               door on it!  It's in there now!

     On the other side of the door, CRASHING AND BANGING can be heard.

                              ROBY
               What's it doing, having a seizure?

                              STANDARD
               It started crashing around right
               after we locked it in.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               I guess we open the door and net it.

                              HUNTER
               I hate to open that door.

     Again the thing can be heard CRASHING AROUND INSIDE.

                              STANDARD
               It looks completely different from
               the first one -- it's more like a
               worm with legs... and tentacles.

                              FAUST
               Well we better do something.

                              HUNTER
               Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped
               in there.  We could just leave it in
               there all the way back to Irth.

                              STANDARD
                    (snaps)
               Don't be an idiot.

                              FAUST
               I know what we can do.  We can pump
               poison gas into the room and kill
               it.  Through those ventilator slots
               there.

     He indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.

                              ROBY
               Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our
               food supplies in there!  We can't
               pump poison gas all over them!

                              STANDARD
               Once we kill the thing we won't need
               the food any more -- we can go
               straight into hypersleep.  Also, it
               sounds like that thing is already
               doing a pretty good job on our
               supplies; it may be fouling them
               all.

                              ROBY
               You win.

                              FAUST
               Somebody gimme a hand, I'll get the
               stuff.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FOOD LOCKER - LATER

     CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THAT they are fastening a large funnel-
     shaped device over the ventilator grill at the bottom of the door.
     This funnel is attached to a thick hose, which runs back to a large
     metal tank with pressure gauges.

                              STANDARD
               Get those masks on.

     They pull on gas masks.

                              ROBY
               This stuff's deadly -- I hope we
               know what we're doing.

                              STANDARD
               Go ahead, Jay.

     Faust turns on the machine.  It begins to throb as it pumps the gas
     through the hose and into the room.

     Immediately, THE CRASHING NOISES RISE IN CRESCENDO, AND THE THING CAN
     BE HEARD SCREECHING AND SQUEALING.

     Then the sounds stop altogether.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Shut it off.

     Faust shuts off the pump.

                              ROBY
               Now what?

                              STANDARD
               What do you think?  Now we go in.

     Standard steps to the door and opens it.  A thick cloud of gas billows
     out.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     The room is thick with the poison gas.  The men look like insects in
     their gasmasks.

     The food packages are ripped to shreds, and foodstuffs are scattered
     all over the floor.

                              FAUST
               Looks like he helped himself.

     Carefully, the men poke through the garbage, net and prods raised.

     Then Hunter points.

                              HUNTER
               God damn it.

     They all look where he is pointing.  In the wall, A VENTILATOR GRILL
     HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
               It escaped.

     They move to the shredded ventilator and shine their lights into it.

                              ROBY
               Where does that go?

                              FAUST
               All over the ship; we'll have to
               check the charts to know for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Then let's go and do it.

     They head for the door.

                              HUNTER
               Have we got any food at all left in
               the ship?

     They slam the door shut and seal it.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The screens are showing them a schematic of the ship's system of
     ventilator shafts.

                              FAUST
               That one section of the ventilator
               shaft has only two outlets -- you
               notice?  The food storage room on one
               end --

                              HUNTER
               -- And the cooling unit on the
               other.

                              STANDARD
               So it's trapped in between -- now we
               have to drive it out.

                              FAUST
               Poison gas... 

                              HUNTER
               We can't pump poison gas down into
               the cooling unit!  It'll flood the
               whole ship!

                              STANDARD
               The only other thing I can think of
               is for somebody to crawl in there
               and flush it out.

                              ROBY
               Are you crazy?

                              STANDARD
               The man would need protection,
               obviously -- as well as some way to
               drive the thing before him.

                              FAUST
               How about a flamethrower?  That
               wouldn't poison the air.

                              MELKONIS
               So one of us goes into the airshaft
               and drives the thing along --

                              STANDARD
               While the rest of us wait down in
               the cooling unit with the net.

                              HUNTER
               Sounds like a rough one.

                              STANDARD
               Got a better idea?

     Hunter shrugs.

                              ROBY
               So the only question left is: who
               gets to crawl down the airshaft?

                              STANDARD
               Let's be democratic.

     He tears five small sheets of paper from a pad on his console.  On one
     of them, he draws a large X.  Then he wads each piece of paper into a
     tiny little ball.

     He rolls the paperballs between his hands and tosses them on the table
     like dice.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Martin, take one.

     Roby picks one up and unfolds it.  It is blank.

     Melkonis picks up another and opens it.  Again blank.

     Faust picks up a ball, and Standard immediately picks his own up.  They
     are both blank.

     They all look at Hunter, who has not yet unfolded his.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open it up, Cleave.

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Hunter is strapping on an oxygen mask and a flame thrower.  Faust is
     helping him.

     Finally, Faust hands him a tracking device.

                              FAUST
               Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you
               won't need me, but if you do, I'm
               here.

                              HUNTER
                    (grimly)
               Right.

     Hunter turns and climbs into the ventilator opening, which is just
     large enough to crawl through.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     It is completely dark in the shaft.  Hunter reaches up and turns on his
     helmet light.  Then he switches on his radio.

                              HUNTER
               Hey, do you guys read me down there?

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Standard, Melkonis and Roby are spreading out the net.  We hear the hum
     of huge cooling plants, and their hair ruffles.  Large airshafts run
     off in different directions.

                              STANDARD
               Yeah, we're getting into position.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Okay, I'm starting now.

     He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel.  He turns a
     corner.

     After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.

     Hunter twitches.  He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE
     DARKNESS.  It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly
     heats up.  Smoke drifts back into his face.  He begins to sweat.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.

                              ROBY
                    (pointing)
               There.  That's where it's got to come
               out.

     He throws a switch, and a large metal panel rises and seals off the
     opening.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               That's a flip-flop gate to channel
               the air, but we can use it to trap
               the thing.

                              STANDARD
               Right now let's keep it closed.

     Melkonis is setting up a little portable unit with a screen on it.  The
     screen shows a section of the ship's schematic.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got Hunter... and something else
               as well, in front of him.

                              STANDARD
               Are they close?

                              MELKONIS
               They're on the next level up.

                              STANDARD
               Let's get moving with this net.

     They lift the net up, holding it in front of the opening.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees.  Up ahead, he can see that
     the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.

     He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his
     flamethrower.

     Then he starts crawling down, head first.

     When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning
     which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.

     Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.

     Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is
     narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering.  He hears a HISSING CRY up
     ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.

     Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal
     flaming burst toward the sound.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

     Melkonis is staring at his screen.

                              MELKONIS
               They're getting pretty close now.

                              STANDARD
               All right, then -- when it gets to
               the other side of the door, you sing
               out, then drop the door.  Okay?

                              MELKONIS
               Okay.

                              STANDARD
                    (to Roby)
               And you and I will bag it, and then
               we'll take it to the ventral air
               lock, got it?

                              ROBY
                    (tensely)
               Uh-huh.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

     Hunter is huddled against a wall of the shaft, clutching the
     flamethrower.

                              HUNTER
                    (whispers)
               Hey, you guys.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Yes!

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
                    (whispering)
               I don't think this shaft goes on too
               much farther... anyway it's getting
               pretty hot in here... 

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
                    (into communicator)
               Okay, our screens show you as being
               near to the opening.  We'll open it
               up, then we'll cue you and you can
               start blasting.  That'll drive it
               right out.  You don't have to go any
               farther.

     INTERIOR - AIR SHAFT

                              HUNTER
               Good.

     He readies the flamethrower.

     INTERIOR - CLIMATE CONTROL ROOM

                              STANDARD
               Okay, get ready.

     He and Roby heft their respective ends of the net, crouched to catch
     the small creature when it darts out.  Melkonis picks up his electric
     prod.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               Open the vent, Sandy.

     Melkonis reaches over and throws the switch.  The metal gate drops
     down, opening up the shaft.

     A SIX-FOOT MONSTROSITY STANDS IN THE OPENING.  GHASTLY BEYOND
     IMAGINATION, SQUAMOUS, COVERED WITH TENTACLES, IT HOPS DOWN LIKE AN
     OVER-SIZED BIRD AND GRABS MELKONIS IN RAZOR-SHARP TENTACLES.

     Melkonis lets out a horrible shriek, and the thing grabs his head in
     one claw and TWISTS IT OFF LIKE A MAN PULLING THE HEAD OFF A CHICKEN,
     THEN THROWS IT TO THE FLOOR WITH AN AUDIBLE CLUNK.

     CLUTCHING MELKONIS' BODY TIGHTLY AGAINST ITSELF, IT TURNS AND BOUNDS
     DOWN THE HALL.  MELKONIS' HEADLESS BODY IS STILL KICKING AND STRUGGLING
     AS THE MONSTER LEAPS HEAD-FIRST INTO ANOTHER AIR SHAFT.

     Standard and Roby are left standing in shock.  After a moment, Hunter
     climbs out of the shaft.

                              HUNTER
               What happened?  Where is it?

     They break from their paralysis, and run toward the opening the
     creature just leaped into.  It is another shaft, going down into
     darkness.

                              STANDARD
                    (awed)
               How did it get so big?

                              ROBY
               By eating our food supplies.

                              HUNTER
               Where's Melkonis?

     INTERIOR - FOOD STORAGE ROOM

     Faust is still waiting.

                              FAUST
                    (into his communicator)
               Hey, are you guys still there?
               What's going on?

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful --
               it's huge now.

                              FAUST
               Right.

     Faust lets himself out of the food storage room and carefully locks
     the door behind him.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are rapidly ascending toward the bridge.

                              HUNTER
               You mean his body was still kicking
               when it ran off with him?

                              ROBY
               It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a
               chicken.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter enter and drop into chairs.  Faust follows
     shortly.  They all look blank, stunned.

                              FAUST
               What happened?  Where's Sandy?

                              ROBY
               Dead.

                              FAUST
               Dead!

                              ROBY
               It's monstrous -- it grew, like some
               horrible tapeworm.  We were
               completely unprepared.

                              FAUST
               It's still in the ship?

                              STANDARD
               We'd better seal off the lower
               maintenance level; at least trap it
               there.
                    (throws a switch;
                     circuitry lights up)

                              HUNTER
               At least it can't get up here now.

                              ROBY
               Two down, four to go.

                              STANDARD
                    (angrily)
               What's that supposed to mean?

                              ROBY
               Nothing.

                              HUNTER
               Listen, it sure didn't like this
               flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               That's right -- we can't kill it on
               the ship, but we can at least keep
               it at bay -- and maybe drive it into
               the air lock.

                              HUNTER
               Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.

                              FAUST
               There's some more combustible fuel
               down in the storage lockers next to
               the lounge.
                    (rises)
               I'll go get it.

                              STANDARD
               No, I don't want us separated.

                              FAUST
               You just sealed it off; it can't get
               to that section.

                              ROBY
               Don't count on it.

                              HUNTER
               We sure need this flamethrower.

                              STANDARD
               All right... but do not go below
               decks.

                              FAUST
               Right.
                    (heads for the door)

                              STANDARD
               And be right back.

	Faust exits.

                              ROBY
               I think it's time we took a hard
               look at those heiroglyphs.

     Roby begins to punch buttons; the photographs of the heiroglyphics
     appear on some of the screens.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Can you make out any pattern in all
               that?

                              STANDARD
                    (baffled)
               Well... yes... there's a pattern... but
               it's meaningless to me.

                              ROBY
               I know it looks like a senseless
               jumble, but if you look closely,
               there are recognizable forms.

                              HUNTER
               Recognizable!  In that?

                              ROBY
               In symbolic form... very stylized... 
               but if you stare at it, you can see
               some of the different creatures
               we've been dealing with.

                              HUNTER
               Well... I suppose that star-shaped
               thing could be the parasite that got
               on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?

                              ROBY
               And right next to it, that oval
               design with the markings -- it's a
               dead ringer for the spore casings.

                              STANDARD
               That next thing there -- six legs,
               tentacles -- that's the thing we saw
               in the food locker.

                              ROBY
               So the next step should be --

                              HUNTER
               -- The big one.  And there it is.

     Out of meaningless geometric symbols on a wall, it has become possible
     to recognize each stage in the alien's life cycle.

                              ROBY
               This is all the same creature.  We're
               seeing the different stages in its
               life-cycle.

                              STANDARD
               Then that tomb... must have been some
               kind of fertility temple... where
               they stored their eggs, and maybe
               held mating rituals... 

                              HUNTER
               ... And Broussard got caught in their
               reproductive cycle.

                              ROBY
               You will notice, though, that there
               are no more phases.  Only four forms
               are shown.  After that the pattern
               repeats.

                              STANDARD
               Which presumably means... 

                              ROBY
               ... More spores coming.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Faust quickly turns a couple of corners and then comes to an abrupt
     halt when he notices that a DOOR LEADING TO THE LOWER DECKS HAS BEEN
     WRENCHED OFF ITS HINGES.

     He hesitates, uncertain what to do, then there is A SOUND FROM THE
     DIRECTION OF THE AIR LOCK... AND THE INNER LOCK DOOR IS OPEN.

     Faust hesitates and peers into the lock.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     The creature is squatting in the middle of the floor, gnawing on a
     bloody thigh bone.  It does not see Faust.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Stealthfully, dropping back into the shadows, Faust presses the wall
     intercom and speaks into it.

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the lock -- blow the main
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard, Roby and Hunter are staring at the pictures.  The call from
     Faust catches Standard in mid-sentence.

                              STANDARD
                    (into intercom)
               What?

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

                              FAUST
                    (whispering)
               It's in the main air lock.  Blow the
               lock.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Standard hesitates, starts to frame a reply -- then changes his mind
     and runs to his console -- and THROWS THE SWITCH.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     With a mechanical whine, the inner door starts to close.  The creature
     hears it and INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAPS OUT OF THE LOCK.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     The creature comes flying out of the lock and DEALS FAUST A BACK-
     HANDED BLOW, KNOCKING HIM ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF THE AIR LOCK DOOR.

     FAUST SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY AS THE INNER DOOR CLOSES ON HIS WAIST,
     crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.

     On the wall, a green light goes on:

                         "INNER DOOR CLOSED"

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Despite the fact that the inner door is still held open a few inches
     by Faust's squashed body, THE OUTER DOOR BEGINS TO SLIDE OPEN.
     IMMEDIATELY, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SCREAM OF ESCAPING AIR.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     In dead silence, a thick spurt of steam comes out of the open air lock
     door.  This is the ship's atmosphere freezing as it squirts out into
     the vacuum under pressure.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is
     sucked out toward the lock.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:

                         "CRITICAL DEPRESSURIZATION"

     After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control
     room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways,
     as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along
     by the air current.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds
     of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt
     against a wall.  As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance,
     HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.

     Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running
     again.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK

     Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the
     hall down from the airlock.  Here, the wind is really terrific -- his
     clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound
     is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.

     Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a
     sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor.  As the hatch
     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.

     Done in, he collapses to the floor.

     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of
     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --
     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can
     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking
     underwater.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS

     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and
     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping
     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses
     bleed.

     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can
     only hear distant croaks.

     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others
     follow him.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM

     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging
     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen
     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.

     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening
     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL
     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the
     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.

     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.

                              ROBY
               How much oxygen did we lose?

     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.

                              STANDARD
               We've got six hours left.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Does anybody know what happened?

                              ROBY
               I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed
               in the air lock door.  His body held
               it open.

                              STANDARD
               Can we get to him?

                              ROBY
               No, I had to seal off a whole
               section.  We'd lose too much of our
               remaining air if we opened the
               connecting door.

     INTERIOR - AIR LOCK

     Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the
     vacuum.  His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.

     The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.

                              ROBY
                    (picking up the cat)
               Poor kitty; puss puss puss.

                              STANDARD
               At least we're rid of the damn
               monster.  It must have been the first
               thing sucked out of the ship.

                              ROBY
               No such luck.  I saw it running down
               one of the corridors.

                              HUNTER
                    (groans)
               Oh no!  We can't fight this thing!
               There's only six hours of air left
               -- we're dead men!

                              STANDARD
               I don't buy that.  There's still time
               to destroy it and get ourselves in
               the freezers.

                              HUNTER
               How?

                              STANDARD
               It's time for drastic remedies.

                              ROBY
               It was time for that a couple days
               ago.

                              STANDARD
               That kind of remark is pointless.
               Now come on -- I want to hear every
               suggestion you can come up with, no
               matter how wild.

                              HUNTER
               We can't kill it on board.  It's huge
               now and must have tremendous amounts
               of that acid in its body.

                              ROBY
               I've got an idea, but you're not
               going to like it.

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
               Okay.  First we shut down all the
               cooling systems on the stardrive
               engines.

                              STANDARD
               That'll blow the ship up.

                              ROBY
               Right... but it'll take a few minutes
               for the engines to overheat and melt
               down the core.  In the meantime, we
               get in the lifeboat and leave the
               ship.

                              HUNTER
               Blow the ship up?

                              ROBY
               And the creature with it.  We can
               make it back to Irth in the
               lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               But the lifeboat can't accelerate to
               light speed.

                              ROBY
               Doesn't matter -- we're already at
               light speed.  And when we get back to
               the Colonies, they'll pick us up in
               the network.

                              HUNTER
               What about all the minerals and
               elements in the cargo hold?  That's
               the only reason we came out here.
               We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd
               be broke.

                              ROBY
               Our lives are more important.
               Anyway, we can take a small amount
               of the most valuable stuff with us
               on the lifeboat.

                              STANDARD
               No, it won't work and I just
               realized why.  There's only one
               hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat.
               Only one of us could survive.

                              ROBY
               Yeah... I forgot.

                              STANDARD
               But the idea's good, if we could
               just turn it around somehow.

     They think.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
               If we could just get the creature
               into the lifeboat, we could launch
               it into space and blow it up.

                              HUNTER
               Good!  That's good!

                              STANDARD
               We can load the lifeboat up with
               explosives and trigger them
               remotely, once the lifeboat is in
               space.

                              ROBY
               I think it's going to be almost
               impossible to drive it up into the
               lifeboat.

                              HUNTER
               We can use the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               It's not going to work.

                              STANDARD
               You can't say that; I think it's a
               good plan.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower needs more fuel.

                              STANDARD
               Right.  We've got a lot to
               accomplish.  Let's get moving.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship.
     A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.

     LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUS
     SHAPES.  Each container is well packed and labelled.

                              HUNTER
               Which explosive should we use?

                              STANDARD
               I'd suggest the N-13 sticks.  They're
               portable, and they can be radio
               detonated.

     Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like
     broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.

     Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS.  He touches
     one of them.

                              ROBY
               You know, it's funny -- this stuff
               we went to so much trouble to dig up
               -- this treasure, the paydirt --
               it'll make it back to Irth just fine
               -- even if we're not with it.

                              STANDARD
               Here, carry these.

     Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.

                              ROBY
                    (grabbing at him)
               Hey watch it!

                              STANDARD
                    (grinning)
               It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop
               it.

     They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR

     The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when
     Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.

                              HUNTER
               Hold it!

     They all stop.  The tracker BEEPS AGAIN.  Hunter puts down his stuff and
     points the tracker around.

                              HUNTER (CONT'D)
                    (nodding up some steps)
               Up there.

     They all look at each other.  Standard puts down his bundle and picks
     up the flamethrower.

                              ROBY
               So what do we do?  Do we ignore it
               and finish loading the explosives
               into the boat -- or do we flush it
               out now?

                              STANDARD
               Now.  If we can get it into the boat,
               we won't have to blow it up -- we
               can just eject it into space.

     Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.

     INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL

     Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps.
     Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard.  He freezes.

     Then he continues up.

     EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE

     The view of interstellar space is spectacular.  As Standard comes up
     the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.

     Standard looks around.  Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS
     OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME.  It is tangled in some rigging, and the
     movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass
     periodically.

                              STANDARD
                    (shouts)
               You can come up!  It's safe!

     The others come up the steps.

                              ROBY
                    (spying the corpse)
               Oh -- Jesus --

     Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn
     loose.  Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.

                              STANDARD
               The ship's gravitational attraction
               must have drawn him back.

                              HUNTER
                    (horrified)
               Should we go outside and bring him
               in?

                              STANDARD
               No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps
               after we've destroyed the thing.

     Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome.  Broussard
     remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and
     ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way.  This
     passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.

     The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the
     equipment.  They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat.  It is an
     extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and
     beams-are exposed.  A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount
     of floor space.  It is an escape-craft, nothing more.

                              STANDARD
                    (pointing)
               Along the base of the walls there.

     They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls
     on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.

                              HUNTER
               This should do it.

                              ROBY
               I should hope so!  And we'd better
               make sure it's pretty far from the
               ship when we blow it.

                              STANDARD
               It will be.

                              HUNTER
                    (surveys the craft uneasily)
               What we really need is some red meat
               in here for bait.

                              ROBY
               Well, if we had some, I'd eat it.
               I'm starting to get hungry.

     By this time, they are exiting.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

                              STANDARD
               Well... now we have to herd that
               thing up here.

                              HUNTER
                    (nervously)
               Whoever's doing the herding is gonna
               have their hands pretty full.  I
               think somebody should stay by the
               lifeboat to slam the door on the
               thing once it's inside, and to serve
               as... as... 
                    (searches for a word)

                              ROBY
               Isn't "bait" the word you used?

                              HUNTER
               Hey look, somebody has to have his
               hands free to lock the creature in
               the lifeboat!

                              STANDARD
               Yes, and maybe launch the boat and
               blow it too... if the others are
               injured.

                              ROBY
               Who gets the privilege?

     INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER.  Three hands pick them up.

     ANGLE ON ROBY.  He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see
     it.  It has a big X on it.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER.  Hunter is showing Roby a small device
     like a transistor radio.

                              HUNTER
               Just keep your finger off the button
               till she's way away from the ship,
               that's all.

                              ROBY
               Is it armed?

                              HUNTER
               If you press the button right now,
               it will blow the whole nose of the
               ship off.

                              ROBY
               Thanks for the thought.
                    (puts detonator in his
                     breast pocket)

                              STANDARD
               All right, Martin, we'll be in touch
               with you on the communicator.

                              ROBY
               And you'll let me know when you've
               got it coming this way... 

                              STANDARD
               And you stand aside while we drive
               it in, then shut the hatch, launch
               the boat, and --

                              ROBY
               Kablooey.

     Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.

                              STANDARD
               Come on; we haven't much time, air
               is a factor.

     They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower,
     Hunter the tracker.

     Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to
     familiarize himself.  Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat
     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.

     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY."

     Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:

                              STANDARD
                    (over, filtered)
               We've got something on the
               tracker... got to be it, it's
               too big for the cat.

     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO
     THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.

                              HUNTER
                    (over, filtered)
               It's coming from down there.

     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,
     breathing, etc.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP

     Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at
     the tracker.

                              HUNTER
               It must have stopped moving.  I'm not
               getting anything.

                              STANDARD
               Let me go first; you stay behind me.

     Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor.  Then THE CREATURE POPS
     OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.

     HUNTER SCREAMS.

     Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him
     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.

     Standard doesn't know what to do.

                              HUNTER
               The flamethrower!

                              STANDARD
               I can't, the acid will pour out!

     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN
     MORTAL AGONY.

     Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires
     -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER
     CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.

     Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of
     flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the
     shrieks and crashing noises.

     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.

                              ROBY
               Hello?  Standard?  Hunter?

     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his
     expression that he expects none.

     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has
     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other
     hand.  He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He
     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.

     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps
     into the maintenance level.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that
     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he
     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.

     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,
     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.

     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the
     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.

     INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM

     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal
     ladder to the floor.

     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,
     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.

     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.

     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from
     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.

     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close
     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF
     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.

     Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps
     violently.

                              STANDARD
                    (a feeble whisper)
               Kill me... 

                              ROBY
                    (sickened)
               What did it do to you?

                              STANDARD
                    (moves his head slightly)
               Look... 

     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles
     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller
     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE
     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.

                              STANDARD (CONT'D)
                    (whispering)
               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... 

                              ROBY
                    (looking around for a tool)
               I'll get you out of there.

                              STANDARD
               No... don't... 

                              ROBY
               But I can save you -- get you to the
               Autodoc!

                              STANDARD
               No good... it's eaten too much of
               me... 

                              ROBY
                    (in horror)
               What can I do?

                              STANDARD
               Kill me... 

     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look
     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and
     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and
     scrambles back up the ladder.

     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.
     At length, he regains control of himself.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED

     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters
     rolling past in the infinite distance.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a
     little oxygen tank on it.

                              ROBY
               Kitty go bye-bye.

     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss
     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in
     front.  It YOWLS.

     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.

     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY

     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the
     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal
     cannisters.

                              ROBY
                    (reading from labels)
               What'll it be, Kitty?  Here -- how
               about some Tacitum-35, ten kilos of
               it.  This'll buy us an island on some
               nice planet.

     Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries
     back up the steps.

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine
     room, containing the massive stardrive engines.

     He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the
     engines.  Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one
     by one.

     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  The cooling units for the
               stardrive engines are not
               functioning!  Engines will overload
               in 4 minutes, 50 seconds!  Attention!

     Finally Roby closes the last switch.  Shaking with nervousness, he
     hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Roby hurries on, listening to the siren.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overheat and
               main core will melt in 4 minutes, 30
               seconds!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed.  Hands full,
     he starts to enter the connecting passageway.

     INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAY

     THE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THE
     LIFEBOAT.

     It HISSES and starts toward him.

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws
     the switch.  The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the
     lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               4 minutes!

     Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button.  The thing can
     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.

     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding
     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the
     ship as he sprints for the engine room.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes, 30 seconds!

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     The door crashes open and Roby comes running in.  The room is full of
     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in
     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.

     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit
     switches.

     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               3 minutes!

     Roby pushes a button and speaks into it.

                              ROBY
               Computer!  I've turned all the
               cooling units back on!  What's wrong?

                              COMPUTER
               The reaction has proceeded too far.
               The core has begun to melt.  Engines
               will overload in 2 minutes, 35
               seconds.

     A look of terror comes onto Roby's face.  He turns and runs from the
     engine room.

     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time
     up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will overload in
               2 minutes!

     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP

     Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where
     the lifeboat is berthed.  He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward
     the passageway.

     It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.

     Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him.
     Then he advances on the passageway.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the
     passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands.  He is goaded on
     by the siren and the computer:

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               90 seconds!

     He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his
     head into the lifeboat.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     HIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is
     EMPTY.

     INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY

     Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway.
     There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.

                              COMPUTER
               Attention!  Engines will explode in
               60 seconds!

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and
     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the
     seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button.

     EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE

     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE
     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK."

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates
     away from the mother ship.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of
     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly
     circumstances.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the
     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches
     his head down over it.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,
     until it is barely a point of light.

     THEN IT BLOWS UP.

     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL
     DIRECTIONS.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling
     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.

     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of
     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed
     in orange light.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away
     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of
     his ship and friends.

     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN
     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.

     The cat SCREECHES.

     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of
     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.

     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.

     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on
     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any
     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,
     with the door standing open.

     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.

     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker
     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face
     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that
     Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's.  The sight is
     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.

     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It
     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.

     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE
     GLASS.

     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the
     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.

     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the
     catbox.

     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull
     it on.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see
     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing
     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it
     into a crevice in the wall.

     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the
     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the
     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.

     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.
     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.

     Again he raps on the glass.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.

     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER

                              ROBY
               Try a little of this, you fucking
               bastard.

     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT
     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.

     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid
     begins to flow from the wound.

     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a
     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.

     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into
     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel
     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT
     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.
EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing
     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't
     let go.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and
     yanks it.

     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END
     OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.

     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,
     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is
     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.

     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:

                              "RAM JETS"

     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE

     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the
     creature is wriggling.  THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN
     SHUT OFF.

     INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT

     Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a
     writhing, smoking, foaming mass.

     As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats --
     then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all
     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling
     into infinity.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER

     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He
     seems calm and composed, almost cheerful.  The cat purrs in his lap.

                              ROBY
                    (dictating)
               ... So it looks like I'll make it
               back to the Colonies on schedule
               after all.  I should be to the
               frontier in another 250 years or so,
               and then with a little luck the
               network will pick me up.  I'm not as
               rich as I was a couple days ago --
               but I'm not exactly broke either.
               Incidentally, I did manage to
               salvage one souvenir out of this
               whole mess.

     He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls
     out the ALIEN SKULL.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               Poor Yorick here should go at least
               partway toward proving I'm not a
               crank.  I wish it was him we'd met in
               the first place -- things might have
               turned out different.

     He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.

                              ROBY (CONT'D)
               This is Martin Roby, executive
               officer, last survivor of the
               commercial vessel SNARK, signing off.
               Come on, cat, let's go to sleep.

     Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder.  Then he rises and,
     carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open.

     He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against
     his chest.  With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER
     HIM.

     CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering
     Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth,
     250 years from now.

     As SNARK 2 drifts past camera, we suddenly see that A SPORE POD IS
     ADHERED TO THE UNDERBELLY OF THE CRAFT.

     ROLL END TITLES & MUSIC.

"But how will you die when your time
comes, Narcissus, since you have no
mother?  Without a mother, one cannot
love.  Without a mother, one cannot die."

			- Hesse





ALIEN III


THE SCREEN IS BLACK

A pinpoint of light appears.
Red.  An ember. 
Unseen BELLOWS blow.

GLASS FURNACE

The embers glow.  Flame.
The fire GROWS.

A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS

Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. 
White Hot.

GLASS FACTORY

Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  
Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,
it too now old and dry.

SMOKE

Billows up the walls.
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --

A MAN

On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. 
His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. 
He is a MONK.

LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.
The smoke begins to escape.

The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --
Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --
a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --

MORE MONKS

By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.
They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished
pieces.  The old way.

ONE PARTICULAR MONK

Black skinned, early fifties.
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but
he is watching something else.  It moves him to song.
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air.
This is BROTHER KYLE.

			BROTHER KYLE
	Well would he guess the ascending of the star,
	Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were.
	He knew the course of every malady,
	Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry.
	Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

We see the object of his song:

BROTHER JOHN

Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
A good face, nonetheless.
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.
Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of
him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.

		       BROTHER KYLE
		Tend you quickly he will,
		with bottles from a shelf.
		But heals not, so easily,
		The ills which plague himself.

Brother John stops stirring.

		      BROTHER JOHN
		   (to Kyle)
		Enough.

He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area.  

		     BROTHER JOHN
		  (to the burned Monk)
		Relax.
		  (to Kyle)
		Put those lungs of yours to better
		use.

		     BROTHER KYLE
		Yes, Doc Tor.

Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --
a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.

He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of 
iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 

John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.

			     JOHN
		Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at
		late afternoon mealtime and don't come
		back to work today --

		     BURNED MONK
		But John --

			     JOHN
		I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.
		You're lucky you only burned yourself on
		the side of the furnace.  If some of that
		glass had gotten on your arm --

He points to the top of his forearm.

	   	            JOHN
		-- it would've burned clean through to
		the other side.

He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  

BELLS toll.
 
		            JOHN
		That's late afternoon.  Now get on.

			BURNED MONK
		Thank you, John.  I --

			   JOHN
		You're welcome.  Go!

The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a
burlap sack.  Kyle comes over.

			  KYLE
		Good work.

			  JOHN
		All right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

  			  KYLE
		You're yourself, that's better...

Kyle pushes him through the door...

INTO THE HALLWAY

The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.
Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.
This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...

			KYLE
		The Abbot will be pleased.

			JOHN
		Don't.

			KYLE
		Don't what?

			JOHN
		Please don't tell him.  At least until
		I know if there's an infection.

			KYLE
		You want to be the Abbey's Physician,
		and you haven't learned the first rule:
		Don't worry about the patient.

John's face drops.

			KYLE
		I shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know
		how you must --

			JOHN
		You don't, but thanks anyway.

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY

A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.
Kyle starts down.  John starts up --

			KYLE
		Not coming down?

			JOHN
		I have someone waiting for me.

Kyle disappears into the crowd.
John moves up...

THE STAIRWAY

A river of brown cassocks running downstream.
John is the only one moving against the flow.
He exits the stairwell --

ONE FLOOR UP

A narrow corridor lined with doorways.
John moves to one in particular.
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.
This is his room.
He opens the door --

IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM

An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed.
At the sight of John it stands.

			JOHN
		Come on, Mattias.

The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. 
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.

INT. LIBRARY

A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions
of books, from the looks of it.
From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table.

A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP

In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his
position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large
KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,
then rises and joins them...

IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY

John leans against the wall as Philip exits.
Mattias is nowhere to be seen. 

			PHILIP
		Brother John.

			JOHN
		Brother Philip.

			PHILIP
		Feeding the mind instead of the body
		again?

			JOHN
		My training has taught me to feed what's
		hungry.

Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.

			PHILIP
		As did mine.  As long as you're alone.
		Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book
		leaves the library.

			JOHN
		How could I forget?  Have a good meal...

John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal Mattias.

			JOHN
		Perfect.

They move into the library...

THE MEDIEVAL SECTION

The oldest books.
John moves to the stacks.
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.
This is his regular place.

AT THE SHELVES

John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.
A smile plays across his lips.

He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain.
Sits on the bench next to the dog.
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...

			John
	    	    (reading)
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

			VOICE O/S
		Sometimes, I think you'd like that.

John turns to find --

THE ABBOT

Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden
CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.

John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.

			John
		Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

			ABBOT
		Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed
		him on the way up.  He said you'd come 
		in alone.  I knew better.

He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.

			ABBOT
		Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

The dog snuffles in response.

			ABBOT
		You know what Philip says about Mattias'
		hair and his breathing.  You'll have to 
		take him out of here.

			JOHN
		He likes when I read to him and -- I 
		can't --

John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.

			ABBOT
		    (smiles)
		Someone must have left this one unlocked.
		Take the book with you.

He hands the key to John, who is shocked --
this is a great honor.

			JOHN
		Father, I --?

			ABBOT
		Kyle tells me you did a good job at
		the glassworks today.

			JOHN
		I'll reserve judgement until the patient
		lives.

John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.
He returns the key.

			ABBOT
		It will get easier.  Father Anselm was...
		an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

The Abbot walks towards the door...

			ABBOT
		Just have it back before the end of lunch.
		Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.

			JOHN
		Thank you.
		      (to Mattias)
		Let's go upstairs, boy.

John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.
Mattias at his heels.
Goes UP --

INTO THE BELL TOWER

The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows.
A doorway leads to --

THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Thick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey
is actually --

THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT

The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  
SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.

This is ARCEON.
An manmade orbiter.
A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user.

This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been
sheathed in wood.

JOHN

Walks to the shore of an inland SEA.
Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.
His eyes grow accustomed to --

THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV

Freckled with tiny dots of light.
Stars.  Spread across the inky void.
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.

John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. 
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. 
He opens the book.
Reads aloud --

			JOHN
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day
		by day, one by one, until I am the only 
		one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear 
		it, then with my dog -- 

Mattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.

			JOHN
		- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest
		this pestilence - this Black Death - 
		stay my hand.
			(beat)
		This was finished by another hand...

John closes the book.  Something catches his eye --
Something among the myriad points of light in the sky.
Millions of miles away:

ONE OF THE STARS

Brighter than the rest.  MOVING.
Fast enough to leave a faint trail.
Across the stars.  And down...
A comet.

John stands.  Watches --

THE STAR

Growing brighter.
Drawing nearer.

JOHN

Joined by three other MONKS.
They are older than he.
The Four men watch the sky...

THE STAR

Brighter still.  Closer.

MORE MONKS

Two dozen.  A hundred.
They come up through the planet's surface.
Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.
Days pass.
Now three hundred.
Necks bowed back.
Mouths agape.
A SUBTITLE identifies...

			RELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON
			-----------------------
			POPULATION: 350 Exiles
			CRIME:  Political Heresy

THE STAR

Fills the sky.
Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.

ON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON

Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --
ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --

John holds up his hands - to touch a star --
Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him,
He turns and watches as it --
Arcs downward --

INTO THE SEA

WHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!
PLUMES of steam rise into the air.
The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.

JOHN

Is the first to hit the shore.
Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.
His coracle is the first into the water.
The others running up behind him.
He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.

ON THE SEA - DAWN

The sun cracks over the black water.
John's hands move the rough wooden oars.
Blistered palm opens.
BLOOD flows.
He tears off a piece of his cassock --
Rips it with his teeth --
Wraps the bloody hand.
Rows.

THE STAR

Ship.  Star Ship.
Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.
White metal skin blackened by the heat.

JOHN

Rows right into it.
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.
Looks around for a knob, a handle --

NEXT TO THE HATCH

A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny
metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.
Then quickly pulls it down...
WUORRRSH -!
Hull door OPENS.

The doorway is a black maw.
John crosses himself.
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch --

			KYLE O/S
		Watch it!

He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --

THE OTHER MONKS

Are rapidly approaching.
Kyle gestulates wildly --

			KYLE
		John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.
He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.
Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him.
He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --

WHOOSH-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY

Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness.  He sees:

NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE

A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the
head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt
warning -- is audible...

			COMPUTER VOICE
			(sotto)
		Seal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

IN THE TUBE

There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

THE FLOOR

Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

JOHN

Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

LIGHTS

Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN

LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07
A legand identifies "Elapsed since separation."
He moves on...

A VIDEO MONITOR

Through scanning bars of snow, an image:
A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.
The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.
Protective. Maternal.

The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.
A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.

			WOMAN
		...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS
		Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.
		Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper
		sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has
		hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.
		Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt 
		and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,
following the trail of blinking instruments --
Drawn to touch a button.  Click...

SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!
Just an oxygen mask.

John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the
plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. 
His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --

HSSSSSSSSS -!
A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --
John SHOUTS and back up into --

ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!

Next to Newt's now empty tube.
Humming gently.  Still operational.
John approaches it cautiously.
He can make out the occupant through the lid...

A WOMAN

The woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.
In hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type
shorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear
again.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  
Closer to hers...

DAYLIGHT spills in --
John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --

THE DOOR

Open.  Kyle and the other monks.

			KYLE
		John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

			JOHN
		No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone
		in here --

The Second Monk looks at Kyle.

			SECOND MONK
		This is forbidden.

			KYLE
		John.  Just get the hell out of there --

			JOHN
		I don't want to stay.  I have to get her
		out before this sinks.  You come in, give
		me a hand --

			KYLE
		Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship,
		so this is technology forbidden to us.
		Get out of there now!

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  "EMERG-OPEN"
That's plain enough.

			JOHN
		All right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY

Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in
front of him.  Unconscious.  
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. 
The monks start to row back to short.

			FIRST MONK
		     (reverent)
		A space ship...

			SECOND MONK
                    (even more reverent)
		A woman...

			KYLE
		You shouldn't have gone in --

			JOHN
		I'm supposed to be a doctor.

He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.

			JOHN
		She could've been lost.

			FIRST MONK
		Been a long time since I saw either.

			SECOND MONK
		It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we
		supposed to do with it?

			KYLE
		What was it like in there --?

			JOHN
		Lights.  So many lights --

			THIRD MONK
		Tow it in.  Bring it in.

			SECOND MONK
		It's evil.

			FIRST MONK
		It's just technology.

			SECOND MONK
		Evil technology.  Look at these fish --

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know what we should do
		with it --

			KYLE
		Just lights?

			JOHN
		Machines.  Buttons.  Metal.

			SECOND MONK
		See?  Just look at the fish.

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know.

			SECOND MONK
		They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 

			JOHN
		Thousands of lights.  Like the stars.
		Like Heaven on Earth.

Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?  She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --

JOHN

He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.

RIPLEY

Shakes her head.  Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --

THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV

Bobbing on the surface.  
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.

RIPLEY

Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers. 
Turns to John, tries to speak --

			RIPLEY
		Wait.  New...

She loses consciousness.  

						GO TO BLACK...

INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Streaks of light move across the darkness.
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are
the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --
The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.
WHISPERED prayers.
LILTING song.

We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.
Ripley in restless sleep.

EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK

The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their 
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --
She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:

JOHN

Sits next to her.  Quite asleep.
Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.

She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --

THE ALIEN

Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --
moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - 
to cry out -- She can't.

She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping
peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --

The Alien moves closer.  
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --

The Alien stands alongside her bed.
Extends a six-fingered hand...
Gently rests it on her stomach.
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.
The implication is clear.

Ripley finds her voice --

			RIPLEY
		AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!

Her eyes open wide --
She sits bolt upright.

A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to
the pillow.  John's.

			JOHN
		You're out of it.  Out of it...

Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:
Nothing.
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head.
She tries to speak -- It was there.
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --

John's hand covers hers.
Eases the fingers open again.
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm.

He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore...

EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY

A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a 
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --

Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Ripley lays with eyes closed.
Muffled VOICES outside her door:

			ABBOT
		How is the woman, John?

			JOHN
		I don't think she's here yet.

At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays 
across Ripley's sleeping lips.

			JOHN
		She is close, though.

As they continue talking, Ripley wakes.  Opens her eyes.
Rolls over onto her side --
There is a window right next to the bed.
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:

HER POV

Garden of Earthly delights...
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --
picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.
It makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...

Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the -- Ripley does a take --

WORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING

With crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all
on one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.

The vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge
glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the
UNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.

Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground:
Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking
the wood onto push carts --

			RIPLEY
		What the hell --?

SUDDENLY --
The Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.
SWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.
Then disappears up, out of sight.
Ripley checks her pulse.

			RIPLEY
		This must be a dream.  A bad one.

She rolls back onto the bed.
Stares up at the ceiling.

ABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray.
It seats with a deeply resounding THUD...

RIPLEY

Hears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you?

			ABBOT
		I am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.
		And you?

He smiles.  Open.  Friendly.

			RIPLEY
		Ripley.  How did I get here?

			ABBOT
		Your vehicle crash landed.
		     (indicates John)
		Brother John found you and brought
		you here.

			RIPLEY
		Where is here?

			ABBOT
		This is the Minorite Abbey within the
		manmade orbiter Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Can I use a radio to --
	
			ABBOT
		We have no radio here.  We are a monastic
		order that has renounced all modern
		technology.  We live the old way.  The pure
		way.

She shakes her head.

			RIPLEY
		Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever
		took me out of the stasis tube must not 
		have run the full D-F program...
		Where's Newt?

The Abbot looks at her blankly.

			RIPLEY
		There was a little girl with me --

			ABBOT
		You were alone.

			RIPLEY
		No.  She was with me.  I put her in her
		stasis tube -- We launched when the --

			ABBOT
		You were the only living thing found
		aboard that vessel.

The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --

			RIPLEY
		     (slowly)
		Oh, God.  Newt.

She stops -- gets that chill up her spine --
She realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.

			RIPLEY	
		It came with us.

The Abbot leans in.

			ABBOT
		What came with you?

			RIPLEY
		Listen -- there is a danger here.  It
		came with me.  How long have I been here?

			ABBOT
		Almost two days --

			RIPLEY
		     (calculates)
		Loose for two days.  This planet could be
		overrun within the week.

Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --

			RIPLEY
		Look, there's a xenomorph --
		    (sees his confusion)
		An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.
		And now it's here.

The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The
guy with his pants down around his kness.

She sees this, releases her hold on him...
	
			RIPLEY
		Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a
		platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission
		to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six
		months ago - maybe a year --

			ABBOT
		     (interrupts)
		Wait a moment --

The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway.
Turns over his shoulder at him.

			ABBOT
		Leave us.

John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.

			ABBOT
		Continue.

			RIPLEY
		We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from 
		Gateway sub-orbital space station --

			ABBOT
		Not possible.

			RIPLEY
		What do you mean?

			ABBOT
		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.
	
			RIPLEY
		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How
		many people do you have here?  Let's worry
		about them.  Warn them --

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands. 

			ABBOT
		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest
		some more.

			RIPLEY
		I don't need rest - I need to get to 
		your people.  You've got to get to them --
		tell them about the alien --

He heads for the door --

			ABBOT
		I have had enough for now.

			RIPLEY
		Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said?
		It could wipe out the entire population
		of this planet.  It may have started 
		already - Have there been any unusual 
		deaths since I got here?

The Abbot stops in the door -

			ABBOT
		No.  And there won't be.

The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him.

THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS

			ABBOT
		Bolt it.

The guards move to bolt the door.

			JOHN
		What is it -- What's wrong?

			ABBOT
		Your patient is in a dangerous mental
		state.  Nobody gets in or out until I
		say so.

			JOHN
		But I.  Her meals --

			ABBOT
		Nobody.

			JOHN
		Father, I don't understand --

The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall.
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks.


THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep.
Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well.
WHAM!
The Library door FLIES open --!
John sits bolt upright -- 

A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in.
Rushes to John's table.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot
		said you'd -- I need -- you're the
		medic --

			JOHN
		What?!

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		My Sandy -- she's ill --

John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.

			JOHN
		Huh?  A woman?

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Sandy.  My ewe.

John returns his head to the table.

			JOHN
		One of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.
		Call a vet.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Father Anselm was the vet.

John looks under his arms at Mattias --
The dog just stares at him.

			JOHN
		You're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.
		All creatures great and small...

INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

A small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages.  The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off.

The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene.  One of
his sheep is laying on its side...

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		I just gave her dinner and she
		keeled over.

			JOHN
		So would I.  It's freezing in here.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Been using the wood from the walls
		for the fire in my cabin.

			JOHN
		Haven't we all...

John kneels at the ewe.

She's breathing heavy.  Rapidly.

John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand.  
She gives a weak "Baa-ah."

			JOHN
		May be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay
		around her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall.
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.

			JOHN
		First, I'll --

He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's
on his left hand --

A SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE

			JOHN
		Wait a minute...

The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch.
John rubs the material between his fingers.
Brings it close to his nose.  Sniffs.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What is it?

			JOHN
		I don't know.  It's all over the ground.
		Some sort of --

BAAA-AAAH!!!
The ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER --
John tries to hold it down --
The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What?!  WHAT?!

			JOHN
		Jesus!  Help m --

The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back --
He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay --
The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers.
Then the hay starts to burn --
Weak fire light revealing:

BAAaa-Aha-SCLORTCH-H-!!
THE EWE EXPLODES ---!

Stomach BURSTS --
SPRAYING the two Monks with entrails and blood --
They start SCREAMING.

The flickering FIRE LIGHT grows as...

A TERRIBLE ALIEN CHEST-BURSTER

BURSTS out of the jerking and twitching carcass.

It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated.  Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted
WOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines.

John can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.

The Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of
his beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic
and instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature --
The sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body --

The CREATURE

WAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is
roughly TORN from it's nesting place --
The Monk lifts --

It TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the
wood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.

The Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire --
The entire corner of the barn is ablaze --
SHOVES the abomination in --

The Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to
lap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --

The creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound
heard within the barn.  The Hysterical Monk holds his fork in
the flame as he looks back to check on --

JOHN

Face contorted, eyes glued to the burning creature.  Heaving
lungs push air through his diaphram, but no sound comes from
his open mouth -- The Doctor in training has seen the devil.

EXT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

Wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre.
Acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out
across the rafters...

We pull back from the sight INTO a window. Into

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley, watches the burning barn.  Frustrated, she climbs out of
the bed on unsteady legs, wearing her tank top and shorts.
Pulls on a coarse wollen cassock, ties the rope belt --

			RIPLEY
		Idiots...I'll --

WHAM!
The door BURSTS OPEN --

			RIPLEY
		What the -?

Four BURLY MONKS rush in and grab her.
TEAR her out of bed --

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway.

			ABBOT V.O.
		An evil has come to Arceon...

IN THE TRIBUNAL ROOM - NIGHT

As he continues we move down a row of stern Monk faces, ending
at the Abbots...

			ABBOT
		You heard Brother Graham tell of the
		devil inside sheep's wool --

He motions towards the Hysterical Monk, sitting in the crowd.

			ABBOT
		An evil brought by this woman in her
		vessel of technology.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet
high.  Light creeps in through stained glass windows.

Hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over
the floor of the Tribunal.  On the floor:

The Abbot and the five eldest Monks sit at a long table facing
the witness stand.  On the stand:

RIPLEY

Considers the faces that surround her.  Fear.  Hate.

			RIPLEY
		This can't be happening.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		You have no voice in this tribunal.

			RIPLEY
		You must listen to me!  You're all in
		terrible danger!  It came with me on
		the ship --

			ABBOT
		We know that.  At first we believed its
		arrival was a good omen.  But it has only
		brought pestilence.  Dead sheep.  Dead fish.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Evil.

Ripley turns to the Abbot.

			RIPLEY
		Yes, the ship brought it.  Not evil. It
		brought the Alien.  I told you, it's here.

			ABBOT
		We know the name of the evil it brought.
		It brought technology.  Technology to
		destroy our planet, as surely as it
		destroyed the Earth.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		Destruction!

			RIPLEY
		I was on the Earth less than a year ago.
		It's still there.  People, cities, all 
		still there!

A murmur through the crowd.  Some are listening to her.
The Abbot looks around.  He must be in command.

			ABBOT
		    (matter of fact)
		All dead.

			RIPLEY
		    (screams)
		It's still there!

The Abbot smiles to himself for making her crack.
He stands and begins to pace.

			ABBOT
		You could not have been on the Earth a
		year ago, because there is no Earth to
		be on -- for at least twenty years.

			RIPLEY
		I haven't been floating in space for
		twenty years.  Let me get to my ship
		and I'll prove it.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		No.  Who knows what new evils she'll
		release if allowed back into that
		infernal machine.

			MONK IN AUDIENCE
		No!  Don't let her!!

			TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		This woman is a danger.  She denies The
		New Dark Age.  She denies reality.

			RIPLEY
		This is reality.  There is a Xenomorph
		loose on this planetoid - a alien -- it must
		have stowed away on my ship -- must have
		killed --
			(swallows hard)
		Newt.  Killed the girl I brought with me.
		You can't stop it.  It goes inside you like
		an egg - grows -
			(mimes)
		Explodes out of you - keeps growing into
		some sort of monster.  Kills you --
		Kills all of you...

She looks at the Medieval people around her.
They stare at her in complete confusion.
To them, she does sound like a madwoman.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you people?  Look at you -- all
		of you -- the way you're dressed.  This
		isn't the Middle Ages.  You're in space --
		on a artifical planet.  What are you
		doing out here?

There, in the upper tier -- John.  They make eye contact. 
She looks to him pleadingly.

			RIPLEY
		Isn't there anyone here who will
		listen?

John looks from Ripley to the Abbot.
The Abbot stares him down.
John turns away.

			RIPLEY
		    (defeated)
		I guess not.  I can't believe this...

The gavel BANGS.
The Abbot sits in a moment of contemplation.

			ABBOT
		Then there is no choice.

The Four Monks grab Ripley roughly --
Bind her arms.

			ABBOT
		   (to Ripley)
		The evil is inside you.  I cast you down.
		To be sealed away.  And God have mercy on
		your soul.

						SLAM CUT TO:

THE SHAFT ROOM - DAY

A Medieval elevator shaft.  The "elevator" is a wooden cage
lowered on thick, rough hewn ropes.
Ripley, bound, is led to it.

She looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door --

			RIPLEY
		You won't be able to fight it...
		You don't know what it is --!

She's put into the cage.  The door is secured.
Two monks begins to pull the ropes.  The cage is lifted out over
the abyss -- a vast cavernesque space.

The other Monks move closer.  Crowd around the edge --
John pushes through them - right to the edge --
Watches as the cage is slowly lowered down...

Ripley looks directly at John --

			RIPLEY
		You've sentenced yourselves to 
		death!

John watches as she disappears down into the darkness...
Then turns and pushes his way through the crowd --
Down the hall --

THE TRIBUNAL ROOM

Empty now except for the Abbot and the Tribunal Members.
They speak in hushed tones.
John appears in the doorway, but pauses -
strains to hear what they are saying:

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		...they'll have started before she gets
		down to the Hermitage level.

			ABBOT
		No trouble?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		Only finding the wood for the ship.  But
		Anderson's hut was about that big, and
		he's dead three months now.

			ABBOT
		I had that wood earmaked for the Cloister 
		next winter.  Well, we might not get to
		the winter if we don't take care of this.
		By winter time we can start taking the 
		penitent cells apart.  No one in them.

			ANOTHER TRIBUNAL MONK
		The wood isn't going to last forever.

			ABBOT
		Neither are we --

He becomes aware of John's presence, and motions the other
Tribunal members out of the room.  John moves to the Abbot.
The Abbot knows what's coming...

			ABBOT
		Go ahead.

			JOHN
		This woman.  Ripley.  I tended her --

			ABBOT
		Yes, and you did a good job.  You
		shouldn't feel responsible.  You
		couldn't have known --

			JOHN
		Please, sir, let me finish.  I feel that
		there may be something to what she says.

			ABBOT
		There isn't.

The Abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel,
notebook.  John follows him --

			JOHN
		I don't understand what you are doing.

			ABBOT
		This colony is my responsibility.  I am
		protecting the colony.

			JOHN
		From what?  This woman?  You never gave
		her a chance.  How can you be so sure
		you're right?

			ABBOT
		A better question is what makes you
		think I'm wrong?

			JOHN
		You didn't see this thing -- this demon --
		Brother Graham and I -- we both saw it.

			ABBOT
		      (realizes)
		That's right.  You both did.
		      (beat)
		And what was it?

			JOHN
		I -- I don't know what it was.  But I
		don't think Ripley was a party to it.

			ABBOT
		She admits she brought it.

			JOHN
		But she tried to warn us --

			ABBOT
		You know that's how the devil works.
		Deception.

			JOHN
		But I believe her.  I don't know how to
		describe it -- A feeling.

			ABBOT
		You haven't seen a woman in thirty years.
		Where does this feeling originate, John?

			JOHN
		     (points to his head)
		Here.

Pause.

			ABBOT
		I believe you.  But your feelings are
		fooling you.  

			JOHN
		It's - It's her conviction.  I just think --

The Abbot snaps at him --

			ABBOT
		Don't think.

John takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never
heard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair.
Forces a smile.

			ABBOT
		It's been a long night.  For all of us.
		You really don't understand what you're
		dealing with here.

			JOHN
		That's what she said.

The Abbot chafes.

			ABBOT
		These are ideas which threaten the very
		system we live under.  The creature is
		dead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.
		Both.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,
		but leave this alone.

			JOHN
		But I --

			ABBOT
		Alone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias
		into the Library, all right?  For your
		own good, just stay out of this.

John looks like he's going to protest.

			ABBOT
		I mean it.

			JOHN
		     (slowly)
		Yes, Father.

John turns and leaves the room.  
The Abbot stares after him.


INT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark. Dank. Dreary.
A NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another.
The board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered.

Another board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM -
HAMMERED in tight.


TWO ANCIENT WORKERS

Drab, torn gray clothing.
Hammer the boards over the opening in the wall.
Methodically covering up --

RIPLEY

Watching them work.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Defeated.


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT)

A dozen Monks frantically hammer planks up around the Sulacco
escape ship - A frame of wood --
begin to wall it in...


IN THE PRISON LEVEL

The two ANCIENT WORKERS continue their carpentry.
The planks cover more of the opening.
BAM-BAM-BAM.

Covers more of Ripley.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
She stares...


ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Planks are rising around the ship.
Covering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil.

IN THE LIBRARY

John and Mattias sit before an open book.
He doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers.
It seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet.
Through his SKULL.
He closes his eyes in pain.

RIPLEY

Only her face is visible.
Another board.
BAM-BAM-BAM.
Then just her eyes.

Just before the last plank is put in place --

			WORKER
		Here you go, woman.  Something from your
		ship.  Something to keep you company --

He tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it.
Watches as the last of the light is covered over.
BAM-BAM...BAM.

She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow
accustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between
the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see
what it is she has caught --

NEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD.

Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind
other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice
crossways towards the edge of the pie. 
Looks at the Doll's head in her hand.
A beat.

She FREAKS OUT --!

			RIPLEY
		You fucking idiots!  You're dead!
		You're all dead!

BEATS the walls.  KICKS.
SMASHES her HEAD against the wall.
Again.
Her nose starts to bleed.
Her hand goes to her nose.
She squints in the darkenss.
Sees the BLOOD.
Tastes the iron taste in her mouth.
Death is with her again.

			RIPLEY
		     (sotto)
		Dead...

The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide
down into a sitting position.  She does.

			RIPLEY
		Christ.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here.
		Shit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it...

Looks at the Doll's head --

			RIPLEY
		Newt.  This isn't what I wanted...

She throws the doll's head away --
It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position
so that it is staring at her.

			RIPLEY
		     (snaps)
		Don't stare at me!

Beat.

			VOICE O/S
		Sorry.

Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her --
Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers:
A HOLE.  In it:

A MAN'S FACE

Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut.
He's looking back at her.


ON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT

The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have
finished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey.

As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow --
Pass them -- down to an open window and into...


INT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN

John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet.
The tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of
books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED.
All open to --

PICTURES OF DEVILS

Different representations of Evil through the ages --
Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan.
"The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss
Lichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from
"Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry."

The devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid.
Gruenwald's "Temptation of St. Anthony."
Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil."
A miasma of Medieval Monsters.


JOHN

Picks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles
through book after book.

The first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge
stained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval
tome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted
as having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops.
This is it.

We can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION:

His eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the
image would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say
something -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog.

John wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot
up against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT!
The old chain gives way.

Face set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag
over his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets
his sleeping dog and goes...


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY

John strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and
flattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's 
office opens suddenly --

BROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the 
room by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other
direction.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the
doorway with the Abbot.

			JOHN
		Now find John and have him brought to 
		me immediately.

			THIRD BURLY MONK
		Yes, Father.

			ABBOT
		Start in the library.  And keep it quiet. 

The Third Burly Monk nods and moves off.
The Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and
closes the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then
makes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY

The first Monks straggle in for the morning shift.
Kyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall
mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two
other Monks begin to stoke the fire.

John enters.
Looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find --


KYLE

At the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the 
MOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him.
Almost knocks him over --

			KYLE
		Hey!  Watch it!

He sees that John is agitated --

			KYLE
		What?  What is it?

The other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in
for a look...

			JOHN
		I -- Abbot.  Must --

John tries to catch his breath.  He gestulates wildly.
Kyle puts down his blowing iron.

			KYLE
		John - relax.  Take a deep breath -
		Christ, now I sound like you --

He sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands.

			KYLE
		Is that it, John?  Is it the book --?

			JOHN
		     (panting)
		Yes.  Devil.

Kyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously.
John sees the other monks gathering around --
Closing in on him - whispering --

			WHISPERING MONKS
		He's got it...

			SECOND WHISPERING MONK
		Like the Comet Woman...

			THIRD WHISPERING MONK
		He found her...
		
			WHISPERING MONK
		He's infected...

John sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell
the Abbot.  John looks into his friend Kyle's face -- Fear.

			KYLE
		Everything's gonna be fine.  Now, let's
		see the --

			JOHN
		Don't humor me -- I'm --
	
			KYLE
		Sure.  Everything's gonna be fine...

If only he could explain - he can't.
John YANKS the book away -- spins --
Bursts through the crowd...

			KYLE
		Wait -- JOHN!


INT. SHAFT ROOM - DAY

The cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss.
John runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor.
Tightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing:  
The woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it.
He PULLS --

There's no tension against the ropes.
John FALLS back on his ass.

The ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead.
Pile on the floor in front of John. 
He lifts the end of the rope.  Stares:
BITTEN THROUGH.

							CUT TO:

THROUGH THE MONASTERY - SERIES OF SHOTS

John RUNS through the building.
Through the upper half of the planet.
DOWN through the many levels, past dozens of Monks oblivious to
the previous night's events and the danger they face:

Monks working at Looms.
Monks in the Tanning Room.
Monks in Morning Prayer.
Past them all, to --


INT. ABBEY BASEMENT WORKROOM - DAY

Mops and brooms.
John enters.  His hair is wild, breathing heavy.
He shoves the book into his medical bag.
Pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a
WOODEN DOOR set into the timbers of the floor.
He opens the door:


LADDERS

Extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level.
Past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters.
Beyond that - a great underground sea that marks the center of
the planet - below that, the cells.
And Ripley.


JOHN

Can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels.
He MUST go down -- The hard way.
He climbs into the darkness...


INT. ABBEY LAVATORY - NIGHT

An enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting
of at least a hundred open toilet STALLS facing a hundred wall
mounted SINKS.  Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful
truth -
The stalls furthest away from us are COBWEBBED.
Some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood.
Of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still
functional - A facility created for a much larger number of
colonists than are left.

A SKINNY MONK washes his hands.


IN THE STALLS

Moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a
few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to
last being The Abbot --

			ABBOT
		Cold tonight --

-- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member.

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Gets colder every night.

			ABBOT
		And every day.  Never this bad.  Taken
		so much wood out of the structure the
		surface wind blows right through the
		colony.  Right under the floor --

The Bald Tribunal Member SHIVERS as a cold breeze runs along the
waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl. 

			BALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER
		Right up your bloody backside.  Nights
		like this make me miss plumbing -- 
		Ack --!

He feels a TUGGING at his bowels - it's not piles. 
A beat.

			ABBOT O/S
		What?

			BALD TRIBUNAL MONK
		I don't -- AAH --

The Bald Tribunal Monk SCREAMS as something GRABS him from
below --

(note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off.
I have completed the text to the best of my ability.)

Something SNAKES up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine!
He convulses in spasms of agony.

There is a terrible RIPPING SOUND as the Bald Tribunal Monk is 
PULLED VIOLENTLY down -- out of frame --

We PAN BACK down the row of stalls tight on each sitting Monk
and see their HORRIFIED REACTION as they feel the ALIEN drag the
Bald Tribunal Monk's body away under them...

THE ABBOT in his stall

He pounds on the wall --

			ABBOT
		Matthew?  Matthew?  Jesus, what's wrong?

SKINNY MONK washing his hands, sees all this.  Looses control
of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet --


OTHER MONKS

In their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore!  
Blood and viscera spraying the walls -- converting the Abbey
into an abattoir.

							CUT TO:
SPACE

Angle on the Orbitor Arceon:

An orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial
seas.

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Death...


INT. RIPLEY'S CELL - NIGHT

Darkness.  Somewhere water drips into a puddle.
Ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting
near the hole in the floor.  Her eyes are closed.

			RIPLEY
		Wherever I go.

A HAND pushes a crust of bread through the hole. 
She opens her eyes to look at the food.  The White-Haired Man's
head appears --

			WHITE-HAIRED MAN
		Take it.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks, but no thanks, Anthony.

She knows his name.

			ANTHONY
		You waiting for meat?  They don't bring
		me meat because they know I'm an android.
		Really don't need it.  Bread's better
		for you anyway.  Harder to digest, so 
		it makes you feel fuller than you are.

			RIPLEY
		Not hungry.

Anthony takes a bite.

			ANTHONY
		Mmmm.  Just a little crunchy.

Ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the
ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		Waste of time.

			ANTHONY
		You don't eat, you'll starve to death,
		girl.

			RIPLEY
		That was the plan when they put me down
		here.  And why should you care?

			ANTHONY
		Because I'm a synthetic person you don't
		think I can care?

			RIPLEY
		Believe me, that's a discussion you don't
		want to have with me.

			ANTHONY
		You told me you had a bad experience and
		a good one with androids --

			RIPLEY
		That's one of each.  That means you could
		go either way.  I'm tired of talking about
		this.

He pushes the bread towards her again.

			ANTHONY
		You've still gotta eat.  You gotta fight
		the bastards --

			RIPLEY
		I'm tired of fighting.  Maybe I'll be
		dead before he finds me.  Maybe he won't
		get the satisfaction.

			ANTHONY
		He?  You make it sound like this Alien
		has a personal score to settle with you.
		The biology you describe:  Queen laying
		eggs, larvae, drone -- that's very
		insectoid.  Insects usually don't bear
		grudges.

			RIPLEY
		And Androids usually aren't the prisoners
		of lunatics that believe they're ancient 
		Greeks.

			ANTHONY
		Medieval Monks.

			RIPLEY
		Whatever.	

			ANTHONY
		And they've only chose to live the life
		style, they don't believe they're --
		     (hears something)
		What's that?

Ripley strains to listen.  In the distance:
KNOCKING.  Someone is knocking on the walls.
A VOICE calls out --


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

			JOHN
		     (hoarse)
		Ripley!

He moves down the hallway.
BANGS his fist against the walls every few feet --
Waits a moment for a reply, then moves on.


INT. ANTHONY'S CELL

Anthony gets off the floor - Moves so she can see into his cell:

The walls of Anthony's cell are covered with charcoal sketches -
Different versions of demons and the devil.  She rolls her eyes -
This guy is an Android!

Anthony crosses to his cell door, peers through eye level.


INT. PRISON LEVEL CORRIDOR HALLWAY - ANTHONY POV

John coming towards him, knocking on the doors of boarded up cells.

			ANTHONY
		Hey -- you knocking -- cut it out --
		You're going to wake everybody up.

John moves to Anthony's door.  Looks at him through the slot.
Anthony recognizes him.

			ANTHONY
		Brother John?

John unbolts Anthony's door.
Picks him up by his cassock --

			JOHN
		Anthony?  Thought you dead fifteen years.

			ANTHONY
		Made too good for that.  What're
		you doing?

			JOHN
		I -- I'm looking -- the Abbot --

			ANTHONY
		What?  You look like you've seen the
		devil.

			RIPLEY O/S
		He has.

Anthony turns to look back at Ripley -- moves aside so John can 
see her face at the hole --

			ANTHONY 
		You mean he --

Anthony turns back - John is gone.

INT. THE CORRIDOR

As John begins to PULL the outermosk planks off.

			RIPLEY
		I was right, wasn't I?  You've seen it,
		you've seen the Alien?

John pauses at that.  
His eyes tighten at the memory.

			RIPLEY
		I can tell you have.  I was right.
		It came with me.
			(to the wall, sharp)
		Go away.

John stops.  Looks at the wall.
Ripley's voice comes clearly through the wood...

			RIPLEY
		Listen, priest, or whatever you are, I
		know what you want.  I can't help you.
		I couldn't help any of the others.  
		Just stop what you're doing.  Go away.
		Do you understand?

John has opened a crack that exposes Ripley's eyes.  
He stares at her a beat, tries to think of what to reply --
He goes back to work as she continues her confession...

			RIPLEY
		You going to stay, Father?  But you're 
		not going to talk.  Okay.  Then you can
		listen.  You should listen.  Your Abbot
		was right.  I am guilty.  But not of 
		heresy.  Of murder.

John stops again.
Just stares at her eyes.

			RIPLEY
		The murder of the crew of the Nostromo.
		That was when I first met the Alien.

That reminds him of why he's here.
He doubles his efforts at the boards...

			RIPLEY
		No, not the same one that's here now.
		Or maybe it is.  Maybe they're all the 
		same one.  I couldn't save my crew then.
		I should have been able to.  But I couldn't.
		When I went the second time --

Her eyes soften.

			RIPLEY
		Then I met Newt.  Newt.  I fought --
		stayed alive to keep Newt alive.
		Hoped maybe that would make up for...

She trails off.  Slides down the wall.

			RIPLEY
		Now he got her too.  What's the point?
		     (hard again)
		Just go away.  Leave me in here.  If you
		let me out you'll want me to help you
		and it will start all over again.
		Let it end.

John breaks through, flickering torch light streams in the mote
filled air around him.  Ripley looks up at him.

			RIPLEY
		I can't help you.

John, heaving and panting from the excertion.
Swallows...

			JOHN
		Puh. (pant) Please.

			RIPLEY
		It never ends.


INT. CORRIDOR - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

A long, twisted-plank-floored corridor with a torch every 
twenty feet.  There is MOVEMENT at the far end.  Something is
coming towards us - FLICKERING in and out of the light and 
shadow --

			RIPLEY O/S
		Sheep?

RIPLEY, JOHN AND ANTHONY

Running together.  Anthony carries a long wooden staff like a 
spear.  John has his bag.  Ripley a torch. 
We move with them.

			ANTHONY
		It must be able to take on some of the
		characteristics of the animal it grows in.
		Maybe they are from some sort of aggressive
		soldier race -- warring parties drop the
		eggs on opposing planets --

			RIPLEY
		And the alien takes on the form of the
		creature that finds it, assuming that
		animal is the dominant life form on the
		planet.  So when it gestates in a man --

Ripley shudders at the memory.

			ANTHONY
		It's a biped.  In a sheep or cow, a quadroped.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.  I just didn't think it could do that
		to animals.

			JOHN
		Wait a minute - I thought you were the
		expert on this monster.

			RIPLEY
		Is that the only reason you came to get
		me out?  Because I knew about this thing?

			JOHN
		Yes.  I mean no.  I mean, that was part of
		it.  Look.  I never thought you were wrong.
		I was wrong not to say anything.  I was
		afraid to speak up.  It's hard to be a 
		monk, you know?

Ripley stops.  Looks at him.
A long beat.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you.  If anything, you're honest.

			JOHN
		We all are.  Took vows.

			RIPLEY
		I don't know about the Abbot.

			JOHN
		I'm sure he thinks what he did was right.

			RIPLEY
		Is that speaking up for someone?

			JOHN
		No.  Charity.

She smiles.  They turn a corner...


INT. SLOPING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

This hallway slopes downwards a few degrees.  The three find 
themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.

			RIPLEY
		All right, let's forget about the past
		and get on to our survival.  No more
		prisoners behind us?

			ANTHONY
		Not for years.

			RIPLEY
		Okay -- If the Alien's had a few days
		to lay his eggs our only hope is to get
		off this - What is this?

			JOHN
		Arceon.

			ANTHONY
		Satellite.

			RIPLEY
		Get to my ship and get off this Satellite.

			JOHN
		We can't.

			RIPLEY
		We can't what?

			JOHN
		Leave Arceon.  Can't leave the library --

			RIPLEY
		A Tape Library?

			JOHN
		Books.

			RIPLEY
		So?

			JOHN
		The reason we are out here.  Like the
		Monks who guarded Monastery Libraries 
		on remote islands off England during
		the First Plague --

			RIPLEY
		There must be books on other colonies --

			JOHN
		Some of these books survived the burning
		of the Libraries of Alexandria.  They
		contain knowledge that exists in no 
		other record.  Their value is unestimable.

He runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.

			JOHN
		We're supposed to protect them.

			RIPLEY
		    (to Anthony)
		And what does an android have to do 
		with all this?

			JOHN
		He's a spy.

			ANTHONY
		The Company planted me here.

			RIPLEY
		The Company?  What does the Company have
		to do with this?

			ANTHONY
		They built this prison.

			RIPLEY
		Prison?

			JOHN
		Colony.

			ANTHONY
		Prison.  They are all political heretics.  

Ripley looks at John.

			RIPLEY
		You left that part out.

			JOHN
		The order was more of a counter culture,
		a reaction to the Technology that was
		beginning to take over everyone's lives.
		It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't 
		watch disk.  Walk, don't pump more carbons
		into the air.  The earliest members
		renounced technology.  Started to collect
		the remaining books.  Nobody would have
		noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.

			RIPLEY
		Your Abbot talked about that.  The
		New Plague.

			ANTHONY
		A computer virus.  A bad program.  By
		this time the Corporate structure was
		transglobal, all the world's data storage
		systems were linked.  It spread through
		two countries before it was stopped.

			JOHN
		After a scare like that, thousands flocked
		to our retreat.  People started clamoring
		for written information.  For our books.
		They abandoned the modern ways --

			RIPLEY
		I think I can see how this comes out.	
		They gave up their possessions.

			ANTHONY
		This was a threat --

			RIPLEY
		To the Company.

			JOHN
		They sold the technology.  A movement 
		to live simply was quickly twisted by 
		Federal agents into a political movement
		against the Company-controlled World
		Government.  Too much was at stake.

			RIPLEY
		Too much profit.

			JOHN
		We were sentenced as political dissidents.
		This orbiter is our gulag.  All the men
		were packed up with all our books, and
		towed into space.  Ten thousand men.  The
		eldest died very quickly.

			RIPLEY
		The Company had such a sense of irony.  
		Sending you out on this wooden tub.

			ANTHONY
		I was placed among them as a sensor.
		Keeps tabs on the movement.

			RIPLEY
		So how'd they find out about you?

			ANTHONY
		I told them.  After the supply ship's
		stopped coming I saw no point in keeping
		up the charade.  Since I was a sort of
		walking reminder of technology, they cast
		me down.

			RIPLEY
		Join the club.
		     (to John)
		I figured this wasn't planned.  You don't
		have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be
		prudent to try to preserve man's written
		works for generations -- without women.

John looks embarrassed.

			RIPLEY
		And I don't know about your New Plague,
		but I was just on Earth and everything's 
		fine.

John has a doubtful look.

			RIPLEY
		I was right about the Alien, wasn't I?
		Means I must be right about the Earth.

The logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.

			JOHN
		     (beat)
		Perhaps.

			RIPLEY
		That's better than nothing.  Come on.

They reach the end of the corridor.
It opens into --


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - PRISON LEVEL

An enormous open space between "cell blocks."
The Wall behind them is honey-combed with corridor openings
going up four stories, connected by aged, warped wooden ladders
reminiscent of Indian cave dwellings.  Only wooden.

The room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them
-- falling off into gloom.

They stand silent for a moment, dwarfed by the size of the room
and the task ahead of them.  Finally --


			RIPLEY
		At any rate, let's forget about the
		Earth completely - whether you're right
		or I'm right what's important is getting
		the hell out of here.  From here my ship
		is...?

John points up at the ceiling.

			ANTHONY
		In Heaven.

			RIPLEY
		Right.  And this is...

Anthony and John nod.

			ANTHONY
		This orbiter was patterned after a 
		medieval concept of the universe --
			 (makes a circle in the air)
		They call the top half "Heaven - "

			JOHN
		The Abbey, the fields --

			ANTHONY
		The bottom half is "Hell."  Where we are.

			RIPLEY
		Aptly named.  What's in the middle?

			JOHN
		The sea.

			ANTHONY
		Really.

			RIPLEY
		Work with me here.  How far is it back
		to the surface of the planet?

			JOHN
		As a stone falls --- Five miles through
		the center.

			RIPLEY
		And the elevator -- the thing they
		lowered me down in?

			JOHN	
		Ropes cut.

			ANTHONY
		It's smart.  First he cuts their escape
		off, then works his way down through the 
		monastery level by level until there
		isn't a thing left alive.  Interesting...

			RIPLEY
		Well, you start appreciating him more
		than me and I'll find a way to shut
		you down, capisce, Andy?  How do we
		get up?

			JOHN
		There are ladders.

She stops.  John and Anthony continue on a few steps and then
stop and walk back to her.

			RIPLEY
		Five miles with the Alien between us
		and there?  Good luck, boys.

She turns and heads back towards her cell --
John catches her shoulder --

			JOHN
		You can't --

			RIPLEY
		Can't what?  Not help you go to your
		deaths?  I've had my fill of that.

			JOHN
		I need you.  I can't do it alone.

			RIPLEY
		I've fought these creatures twice
		before.  It take a lot to kill
		these things.  Heavy artillery.

			ANTHONY
		We don't have weapons here.

			RIPLEY
		How about something we can make weapons
		from?  Do you have anything like that --
		any modern things here?

John SHAKES his head vehemently --

			JOHN
		We renounced technology.  It was those
		things that caused the Plague.

			RIPLEY
		This is a man-made planet.  Something has
		to be recirculating your air, your water.

			JOHN
		God?

			RIPLEY
		Please.

			JOHN
		I don't know.  I just took it for granted.

			RIPLEY
		Most people do.  Without some sort of
		technology we haven't got a chance.

From behind them:

			ANTHONY
		There is technology.

John and Ripley turn to look at him.

			ANTHONY
		A room.  A Technology room.  Fresh air
		and water come out.

			RIPLEY
		An atmosphere processing plant --

			ANTHONY
		The heart and lungs of Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Where is it?

			ANTHONY
		One level beneath the underground sea.

			JOHN
		That's five levels up --

			ANTHONY
		     (points into the gloom)
		On the other side of the orbiter.

John looks at Ripley --

			JOHN
		A chance.

Ripley looks from John's earnest face to the darkness and back.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  You've got me - so far.
		But here's the deal:  I don't know
		how many of your brethren are going
		to be alive when we get up there,
		but if we make it to my ship, you're
		all coming with me.  We'll take as
		many of your precious books as we
		can carry, but we're going.  I'm not
		going to fight this thing again to 
		end up alone again.  Understand?

John nods his head.

			RIPLEY
		We're all dead anyway.  We might as
		well go fi --

She feels a TWINGE in her midsection --
Doubles over.  Anthony and John each take an arm --

			RIPLEY
		Ugh - I'm all right.

She takes a deep breath.

			RIPLEY
		Still thawing out.  I hate hyper sleep...
		Come on.

							CUT TO:


INT. ARCEON - MONASTERY LEVEL - NIGHT

The formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched
battlefield.  Wooden huts leveled.  Small fires dot the land.
The air thick with ash and greasy smoke.

DOZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a 
mound of spilt sugar.  In one hand a taper or torch held high,
in the other hand their WEAPON: scythe, pitchfork, hoe,
whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place.
Some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts
into rough barricades.

A "Platoon" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the
wooden "ground."  More ladders.
They climb down to --


AN UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT

Just beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an 
Underground Wheatfield.  Tall golden grass stretches out for
miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support
the Abbey fifty feet above --

THE CEILING

A lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes --
the "plumbing," the understructure, of the Monastery.


THE MONKS

Descend the ladders single file.  Fear is in all of their faces
though most have only heard the stories.  They move cautiously
into the wheat.  Spread out through the field in the jaggedly
drawn skirmish line.


THE ABBOT

The Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock,
stands atop an empty wooden wagon.  From this vantage point he
watches


THE MONKS IN THE FIELD

THRASH and POKE their way forward leaving trails through the
high grass.  Their attempt at an orderly progression quickly
falls apart as they get strung out all over the field.

			ABBOT
		     (sotto)
		Stay together.  Together...

Then another movement catches the Abbot's eye --
AHEAD of the Monks - the wheat waves against the wind.
Begins to ripple -- the wheat flattens.
a TRAIL forms.
SomeTHING is MOVING in the long grass.
Moving towards the Lead Monk -- FAST.

The Abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning - even
though the Monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to
hear him - before he can make a sound The Alien closes the gap -
Feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as

AARGH-Aa -!
The Lead Monk gives one strangled CRY before he disappears
beneath the surface of the long grass.  His taper falls
among the long, dry stalks -- begins to SMOKE...

The Abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they
can.  He finds his voice:

			ABBOT
		Run!  RUN!

The Monks in the field turn from the spot where the Monk
screamed towards the Abbot -- TURN THEIR BACKS to the now
moving again trail --

			ABBOT
		No - NO.  The --

The Alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle --
RAKING through five Monks like a scythe through wheat.
His tail, arms WHIP out --
SNAP their spines like kindling.
Lost torches ignite the wheat...

The field BURSTS INTO FLAME.
Smoke fills the air.

In the smoky commotion the Monks break rank and start running.
Weapons in front of them -- SWINGING wildly --
Screaming.  Crying.  DYING.

One Frightened Monk runs through another with his pitchfork.
Another hears something crashing through the grass towards
him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest.

And through it all the Alien seems to be everywhere.
Using the chalky smoke for cover as it SLASHES and TEARS its way
across the field --


THE ABBOT

Frozen in terror to the spot.   Squints through the smoke to see
what has happened to his flock.  Hears the WAILS of defeat
rising up from the wounded.

The waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him --

He can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon.
He climbs down.  As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a
shadow fall over him.  The little hairs on the back of his neck
stand up.  He slowly turns...

THE ALIEN

Rises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man.
Slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters.
It's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy.

It is golden.
It's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering.
It has adapted to the environment of the wheat field.  Its now
grass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile.

The Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.


			JOHN O/S
		It isn't your fault, you know.


INT. TRANSOM SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS

They move across the huge room...Anthony a few paces ahead.
Their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards.
Wind whistles through the huge room, timbers creaking like some
gigantic old house settling.

			RIPLEY
		What?

			JOHN
		Those things you said before --

Ripley remembers her "confession."

			JOHN
		I read about it in psychology books.
		Sometimes when people outlive someone
		they cared for, they transfer some of
		the guilt for that person's death to
		themselves.

			RIPLEY
		I got a belly full of that from the
		Psychtechs when I was on Earth.  Yeah.
		"Survivor Guilt syndrome," or something
		like that.  But that's not what I was
		thinking about.  I was thinking about
		my "friend" up there.

She looks up.

			RIPLEY
		He was on the pod.  He killed Newt but
		not me.  Why not me?  It's almost like
		he's playing with me.  Maybe they have
		some sort of race memory.  Maybe he
		knows what I did to his "mother."
		That's why he didn't just kill me.
		That would be too easy.  He has to
		torment me.

			JOHN
		You make it sound human.

			RIPLEY
		Hell, I don't know what it is.

John unconsiously fingers his book.

			JOHN
		I think I do.


INT. LADDER-WELL - PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT

At the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to 
another block of cell corridors four stories up.
Years of damp air have warped the ladder.
Ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand.
They climb...


INT. END OF PRISON CORRIDOR - FOURTH LEVEL - NIGHT

Dark.  Ripley is the first one up.
She raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone.
The cells here have no doors.
She holds her torch in one --
An old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.


AT THE LADDER

John is just climbing off, Anthony right behind him.  
Anthony is winded.  He reaches up for a helping hand.
John looks back and sees that Ripley has moved ahead without
them, then reaches down to help Anthony.
Their hands clasp --


ANTHONY HAS A "VISION"

He is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing
peacefully at his side.
SUDDENLY he is ATTACKED by a horde of Medieval demons.

Fish faced demons.  Man-headed bird demons.
They fly about him, grab hold of his limbs.
The Sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of
razor sharp fangs, SINKS THEM INTO HIS ANKLE --

Anthony SCREAMS -!


RIPLEY

Down the corridor HEARS the scream, turns back -- sees Anthony
fighting with himself, struggling against John's grasp -


ANTHONY

Balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real 
world as he fights against the demons in his android mind --
He JERKS --
Pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the DEMON SHEEP --
OFF the ladder - forty foot drop waiting below him...


JOHN

Struggles to keep his death grip on Anthony's hand.
It's all that keeps Anthony from falling back down the shaft --

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.  Ripleeeee -!

He PULLS with all his might...


ANTHONY

SEES a horrible BIRD-DEMON grasping his hand in its beak --
BITING through his wrist.  He waves his staff in the air --
He aims for its head:
CRACK -!
WHACKS John's hand with his staff --

John HOWLS in pain - LETS GO --

Anthony TEETERS BACK ON ONE FOOT, arms waving in the air --

Ripley's hands SHOOT OUT --
GRAB Anthony's cassock --
STOP his fall.

Anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror --
A terrible, wet, black cable-armed CREATURE that's latched
itself onto his cassock -- Long, shiny head.
Ripley has become the Alien.

WHACK!
Anthony HITS the Creature with his staff --
HITS Ripley on the head.
WHACK!
Again.  In the face.

John tries to take hold of Anthony's staff arm --
WHACK!
The cane WHIPS against the side of his head, knocking him back.
Ripley sets her feet and pulls on Anthony's cassock --
Opens her mouth - GRUNTS --

ANTHONY sees the terrible Alien open it's maw to devour him.

WHACK! 
His staff connects with the bridge of Ripley's nose.
She sees flashes of light -- loses her balance --
Pitches forward, starts to go over with Anthony --

JOHN GRABS THEM!

Wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo
wrestler LIFTS and FALLS backwards - carrying the three of them
into the corridor -- WHUMPH!

They land on the floor in a heap.
Anthony continues to FLAIL ABOUT --

Ripley and John pin him to the floor between them.
Finally, the vision leaves him.
He loses consciousness.


JOHN

Breathing heavy - opens his eyes --
He's staring right into Ripley's face.
Less than an inch away.
He's laying on top of her.
She's breathing heavy too.
A long, uncomfortable moment.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks.

			JOHN
		You're welcome.

They roll off each other.
Her hand goes up to her nose.
Blood.

			RIPLEY
		I'm all right.

John reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.

			JOHN
		Hold this against your nose.  It'll
		stop the flow.

She looks over at him questioningly.

			JOHN
		I'm a doctor.

She holds the small bag against her nose.  The bleeding stops.
They move over to Anthony - try to help him to his feet.
He shakes them off.

			ANTHONY
		No - please.  Just let me sit.
		Awhile.

He rubs his temples.  White, milk-like sweat runs down his
cheek.

			ANTHONY
		Damn it.

			RIPLEY
		What was that?

			ANTHONY
		The reason I'm down here.

John points to his own eyes.

			JOHN
		Visions.

			ANTHONY
		Dreams.

			RIPLEY
		Androids can't dream...

			ANTHONY
		That's probably what they thought when
		they built me.  But my brain is cyber-
		organic - patterned after the human
		brain - it functions the same way a
		human brain does.  It accumulates random
		images and sensations during waking 
		hours, but unlike the human brain that
		sloughs them off during sleep --

			RIPLEY
		Androids don't sleep.

			ANTHONY
		Right.  Maybe they've fixed this on later
		models, but I don't.  Do you know what 
		happens to the human brain when it is
		deprived of sleep?  It starts to run off
		the dreams while you're awake, as 
		hallucinations.  Same thing with me.
		For twenty years I absorbed data on this
		planetoid.  A little after we lost contact
		with Earth the visions started.  They
		thought I was insane.  I had to explain 
		that it was because I was an android.
		They liked that even less.

			RIPLEY
		What did you see?

			ANTHONY
		What I always see.  Images of Monsters.
		Demons.

			JOHN
		They're portents.  They stand for an
		evil yet to come.

			ANTHONY
		Just images I've absorbed from those old
		books and have no way to get rid of.

			RIPLEY
		I saw the inside of your cell.

			ANTHONY
		     (shrugs)
		My head is full of them.  I try to get
		them out any way I can.

His eyelids droop.

			JOHN
		You need sleep.

			ANTHONY
		I know that.  I'll settle for rest.

He closes his eyes.  Ripley recovers the torch.

			RIPLEY
		Stay with him.

Ripley tried to stand - John takes her arm, pulls her down.

			JOHN
		No.  We all need rest.  You especially.

Ripley considers him.

			JOHN
		Doctor's orders.

She smiles and sits.

			JOHN
		Besides, you see what happens when you
		get ahead of us.  We should stay together.

			RIPLEY
		All right.  He's still above us, anyway.

			JOHN
		What do you mean?

			RIPLEY
		I've faced this evil twice before - I
		guess I've gotten sensitive to it --
		     (beat)
		You're really a Doctor?

John pats his canvas bag.

			JOHN
		See my bag?

			RIPLEY
		What's that book?

			JOHN
		Just a book.

			RIPLEY
		I don't buy "just a book" from a guy who
		says we can't leave the planet without
		the library.
			
			JOHN
		It's just... a medical book I might need.

			RIPLEY
		You don't have any food in there, do you?

			JOHN
		Only if you can eat bandages.

Ripley rubs her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		In a few hours that's going to sound
		good.  Going in and out of suspended
		animation - Christ I probably haven't
		eaten in a year.

			ANTHONY
		    (without opening eyes)
		You should've eaten the bread.

			RIPLEY AND JOHN
		Rest!

Ripley lets her head loll back against the wall.
Closes her eyes.  Time passes.
Her brow knits.
John sees this.

			JOHN
		You all right?

			RIPLEY
		Aces.

			JOHN
		You weren't hurt when I landed on you?
		Bruised a rib?

He reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock.
Feels her midsection.  His hands are warm.

			RIPLEY
		Are you sure you're a doctor?

He withdraws his hands.

			JOHN
		Sort of.  My father passed on when we 
		first came here.  The Abbey's Physician -
		Father Anselm - took me in.  He really
		raised me --
			  (pause)
		Taught me what he could before he
		passed away.  He was schooled on Earth.

			RIPLEY
		Well, I'm just hungry.

			JOHN
		You haven't eaten since I took you
		out of your tube.

			RIPLEY
		You did that...

She reaches out and takes hold of his hands.  Turns them over.

			RIPLEY
		You burned yourself on the escape pod.

Her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.

			RIPLEY
		Thank you, I guess.

They look into each other's eyes --

			ANTHONY O/S
		You should've eaten the bread.

Ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands.
Looks at Anthony.  He's trying to stand.

			ANTHONY
		Enough rest.  There's beasties afoot.

They start into...


A NARROW CORRIDOR

Ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them.
Ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks.


INT. LADDER SHAFT

A great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere.
Seems at least a mile long.
The group climbs...


A SERPENTINE CORRIDOR

Liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head.
Falls into RED puddles on the slanted floor.

John kneels, dips his fingertips --

			JOHN
		Blood.
		     (sniffs)
		Mixed with sea water.

			ANTHONY
		We're getting close to the center of
		the arc -- near the sea.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

			JOHN
		Getting close...

John HEARS somthing.
Raises his hand -- "stop"
The group stops.  Flatten themselves against the wall.

John takes Anthony's staff.
Moves forward with it held out in front of him...
WHIRLS around a blind corner --
SHOVES something against the wall --
Thump!
It struggles --

Ripley and Anthony run up -- raise their tapers --
Revealing:

			RIPLEY
		The Abbot.

Cassock torn, dirty.  Hair, eyes wild.
Anthony's staff across his throat. 
John pulls back.

			JOHN
		Father --

			RIPLEY
		   (sarcastic)
		What are you doing down here, father?
		You look like you've seen something
		that doesn't exist.

The Abbot runs his fingers through his hair.  Smoothes it down.

			ABBOT
		I was their spiritual leader.  I was not
		prepared to lead them in battle.
		Not against that thing.

			JOHN
		No one could be.

			RIPLEY
		I thought you said the evil was inside
		me -- that sealing me up was the answer
		to all your problems?

			ABBOT
		Destruction.  The destruction YOU brought
		to us!

			RIPLEY
		I only tried to warn you.

			ABBOT
		What are you doing with this woman --?

			JOHN
		We are going to the Technology Room.
		Trying to find some way to fight --

			ABBOT
		You don't join the devil to fight the
		devil.

			ANTHONY
		She's helping us --

			ABBOT
		Look who defends the deceiver -- the one
		who isn't even human.  John, can't you see
		what is happening?  On ancient Earth,
		during the Black Death - many believed
		that God had abandoned them, so they
		appealed to the Devil.  Flocked to him
		hoping to save their bodies - losing their
		souls in the bargain.

			RIPLEY
		Father, we're all on the run from the 
		same monster so let's not resort to the
		fire and brimstone routine.  I've been
		enlightened about your "movement."
		Pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a
		planet of heretics.

			JOHN
		Please. 

The time for pretense is past.

			ABBOT
		All right.  I was trying to keep you quiet. 

			JOHN
		Sir --?

			ABBOT
		I do what I have to do to keep the
		Brotherhood together.  We all gave up
		believing in Earth a long time ago.  How
		do you think they would feel if told
		their exiled was in vain?  That the
		holocaust they were trying to avoid
		never occured?  Those men up there have
		grown to live with it.

			RIPLEY
		And with you as their leader.

The Abbot smiles.  Ripley is sharp.

			ABBOT
		You threatened the status quo.

			RIPLEY
		So you, protector of knowledge and truth,
		lied to them.

			ABBOT
		Only about you.  The rest I still
		believe.  If Earth still orbits its sun
		there is no way it could have survived
		being reduced to Barbarism.

			RIPLEY
		You're as bad as the Company.

			JOHN
		Ripley --

			RIPLEY
		That's why you ran.  After all your talk
		death stared you in the face and you
		were afraid.

			ABBOT
		Not afraid of death.

			RIPLEY
		The Alien.

			ANTHONY
		The Organism.

			ABBOT
		The Devil.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM CORRIDOR

The now four refugees work their way into the final corridor.
Dark.  Turns at sharp angles.  Blind alleys.
The floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted.
Warped by years of water dripping from above.
The group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles
held high...


ANTHONY

Bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down --
SNAPP!!!
Everybody stops at the sound.

			ABBOT
		What was that?

Anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a--

			ANTHONY
		Man trap.

They lower their candles.  Look to:

THE FLOOR

Interspersed throughout the timbers --
Spring jawed, steel toothed, BEAR TRAPS.
Rusted.  Open.  And all around them.

			ANTHONY
		In case anyone tried to get in and
		tamper with the technology.

The four of them are standing in the middle of a mine-field of
man traps.  Nobody moves.

			ABBOT
		What do we do?

			RIPLEY
		Don't move.  Don't breath.

			ABBOT
		We can't just stand here and wait.

			RIPLEY
		Floor's too unstable to try to walk
		around them.

John pulls a loose board from the corridor wall.
Turns and kneels at the trap in front of him.
Pokes the end of the board into the jaws...
SNAP!!

The others jump at the sound --

			ABBOT
		John - what are you doing?

John pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws.
Moves to the next trap --
Snap!!

			RIPLEY
		He's thinking like a leader.  Everyone:
		Grab wood.  Spring the traps.  Clear a path.
		      (proud of him)
		Good work, Father John.

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Let's go.

Ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her.  
Exposes a bit of the surface underneath --
It's METAL.

She touches the cool, familiar material.  Smiles.
Now she knows this is not a dream.
She turns and SPRINGS the trap in front of her --
SNAP!!


THE FOUR

Slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a
candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in
front of them... SNAP-SNAP...SNAP. SNAP.
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....


THE DOOR TO THE TECHNOLOGY ROOM

A huge wooden door with no knob or handle.  Looks like it could
almost be part of the wall.  John and Ripley are the first to
it.  They put down their planks and begin to feel around the
edges of the door for some purchase.
The Abbot joins them.


BACK IN THE CORRIDOR

Anthony lags behind.  He senses a presence in the hallway.
Hears a sound behind him.
We see a GLIMPSE of something --
He turns towards the sound --

Empty hallway.

He thinks.  Starts forward again -- with his ear cocked to the
rear... SNAP!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley, John and The Abbot knock on the door, walls.
Ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and
exhaustion.  To get this far, and be locked out.
She feels sick to her stomach.
How long since she had food?
She looks over at John.
He is staring at her.
He turns red at being caught.  Cute.

			JOHN
		I just - are you allright?

			RIPLEY
		Tied.  Without sleep, food -- I just
		feel my age.
		       (smiles)
		Figuring hyperspace time, I'm almost a
		hundred.

She wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...

			JOHN
		Hello?

The wall beneath his fist sounds hollow.
Fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull --
The plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.


BEHIND THE PLANK

A primitive KEYBOARD.  Circa late twentieth century.

			JOHN
		I think this is it.

Ripley and the Abbot move over to see.

			ABBOT
		Technology.

			RIPLEY
		Yeah - a hundred years ago.  An antique.

			ABBOT
		     (to Ripley)
		Go ahead.

			RIPLEY
		Go ahead and what?

			ABBOT
		Open the door, woman.

			RIPLEY
		I'll get to it, but listen to me --
		you may dress like you're living in
		the middle ages but you can't treat
		me like your chambermaid, or whatever
		Monks had.


UP THE HALL - ANTHONY

Hears the sound again.  Turns.
Nothing again.
He pauses... Turns back quickly --

The wooden wall MOVES - steps forward --


THE ALIEN

Adapted itself to look like WOOD.

It's body changes -- transmutes -- Cable-like sinew snaking
over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio-
mechnoid alien appearance...!


ANTHONY POV

The weary android sees the Alien as a conglommoration of his
many Medieval images of demons.  He hears the Alien's hollow,
raspy breath.  It glides towards him...

Anthony steps back directly INTO A TRAP as his mind goes --
SNAP!!
The STEEL JAWS spring shut on his left ankle.
Milky blood-fluid starts to flow.

He finds himself in the same predicament as his vision --
Ankle pinned, the Alien's appendages circling him --
He screams.  AAAAAAAAAAAARGH --!


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is trying to work.  She punches numbers into the keyboard.
She is too exhausted to see straight.
They HEAR the scream --
John RUNS back --
Traps SNAPPING around him --
Ripley turns towards the sound --
The Abbot pushes her back to the keyboard --

			ABBOT
		OPEN IT!!

Ripley knits her brows.  Forces herself to focus.
Her fingers punch the keys.


THE ALIEN

Steps towards Anthony --
Snap-snap-SNAP-AP-!!
Traps snap closed on its tail, its legs --


HALFWAY DOWN THE HALL - JOHN

SNAP!!
His cassock is snagged in a trap.
He TEARS right out of it --
AT THE END OF THE HALL

Anthony is in the clutches of the Alien.
He WHACKS at the Beast with his staff, but his blows fall like
drops of rain on an elephant.

The Alien LIFTS him up to face him.  Anthony SCREAMS as his left
leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain --
Blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle.


FACE TO FACE WITH THE ALIEN

Anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with
his own android arms.  His extra-human strength keeps them from
squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from
the smooth, eyeless face.

The Alien considers him.  Its thin, almost translucent lips pull
back to reveal rows of splinter-like teeth.  The jaws spread,
making room for the distended tongue:

The Alien HISSES --
PUTS OUT Anthony's EYES with a thin stream of ACIDIC SALIVA --
Artificial skin BUBBLES AND BLISTERS --


JOHN

Picks up Anthony's staff.
Begins to FLAIL away at the demon.


AT THE DOOR

Ripley is getting no response from the keyboard.

			ABBOT
		What's wrong?!

Ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment.
The wires are so old they've broken.

			RIPLEY
		Shit.

She BITES the ends off the wires - spits out the insulation.
TWISTS the bare wire ends together...
Sweat runs into her eyes.


JOHN

WHACKS the Alien with Anthony's staff --
Again.  Again.  The creature will not let Anthony go.
The Android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered,
pulpy mass, eyes gone.


RIPLEY

Finishes hot wiring.  The keyboard hums to life.
Her fingers FLY across the keys --


THE ALIEN

Tail wraps around John's waist --
Pulls him towards it --
LIFTS him - turns him upside down --

Lips PULL BACK --

John's hands GROPE at the floor --

Sharp metal teeth SPREAD --


THE DOOR KEYBOARD

Lights:  CODE ACCEPTED
Ripley's head whips towards the corridor --


JOHN

His hand closes around the end of one of the traps --
He brings it up --
SNAP!!
It SLAMS closed on the Alien's extended Tongue -!
The Beast bellows!!
Whips its head from side to side --
Can't shake off the trap --
ACID BLOOD sprays out --!
Lands as pools of FIRE on the wooden floor.


THE DOOR

Opens with a strained blast of dust -- SEE-WHORCSSH!
The Abbot LEAPS inside --

			RIPLEY
		It's open!!


JOHN

PRIES Anthony's ankle out of his trap.
Scoops up his staff, drags the moaning Android --
Back up the corridor --


RIPLEY

Stands in open Technology Room doorway --

			ABBOT
		Close it -- close it -- it's coming -

			RIPLEY
		We wait.  John!!

John and Anthony appear out of the shadows --
Run/hobble towards the door --


THE ALIEN

Acid Blood DISSOLVES the traps' steel jaws.  PULLS itself free.
Head whips towards the escaping Monks -- if it had eyes they
would narrow to slits in anger --
RUNS up the hall --


RIPLEY

Follows John and Anthony into the Technology Room.
On the other side of the doorway: another keyboard.
She punches keys --

			ABBOT
		Hurry --

			JOHN
		HURRY!!


THE ALIEN

Yards away -- Limping.  Hissing.
ANGRY.


THE KEYBOARD

Acceptance tone "bings."
The Door starts to slide down --

The Alien is feet away --
INCHES...

The door seats itself closed with a solid THUD.

Ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden
door.  A beat.
She turns to the room for the first time and finds --


WINDMILLS

Real Man of LaMancha wood and cloth windmills.  Two story high
arms slowly rotating.  Moving enormous volumes of air through
the wind tunnel-like room.  As far as the eye can see.
Turning, creaking.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
But no electronics.  No radio.  No weapons.
This is the Technology Room.

Ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.  

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SULACO ESCAPE SHIP #4 (DREAM)

Yellow warning lights PULSE.  Those goddamned STROBES are
flickering on and off.  Steam blasts out overhead pipes.

The blue-spark pilot light muzzles of a FLAME THROWER shyly
pokes out from behind a console.  It's owner cautiously
follows...


RIPLEY

She's breathing heavy.
She's wearing a sweat soaked tank top.
Her eyes flit from side to side.  Then up.  Then down.
She pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod.
She silently crosses the distance to Newt's sleep tube:


IN THE TUBE

Newt sleeps peacefully.
Ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers.
Her grip TIGHTENS in the Flame Thrower in her hands.
She flips a switch to HI HEAT.
Moves around the sleep tubes...

A noise to her left.
She WHIRLS --

Pulls the trigger on the flame thrower -- click.  Nothing.
She tries again -- a half-hearted burp, but no flame.
She begins to panic --

Senses the Alien's presence.
Looks left, right, up - no Alien...
Looks down:

The Alien's tail is COMING UP BETWEEN HER LEGS.
She turns --

Right into it's grasp.
The useless flamethrower SKITTERS across the floor.
She PUMMELS the beast with balled up fists.

			RIPLEY
		No.  NO!  I beat you!  I beat you mother
		fucker!!

The Alien spins her -- pushes her over across the sleep tube --
Like it's taking her from behind!

Ripley looks down into the sleep tube:

Newt is gone.
Her doll's head lays in a pool of blood.
The Alien wraps his arms around Ripley.
Thin lips pull back for a kiss.

She SCREAMS.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - REALITY - DAY

Ripley opens her eyes.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
She's still in the room with the windmills.
Somehow this place seems less real than her dream.
She looks around:

John is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment.
He smiles a relieved smile.

			JOHN
		I thought we'd lost you.

			RIPLEY
		What are you writing?

			JOHN
		Last will and testament.
		      (beat)
		Just kidding.

She looks to her left:
Anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his
eyes.  His ankle is a swollen mess.  Wires are hanging out.

			RIPLEY
		Is he --?

			JOHN
		Resting.
		      (shakes his head)
		He'll be fine.

			ANTHONY
		No I won't.  He's a terrible liar.

			RIPLEY
		I'm sorry.

			ANTHONY
		It's ironic.  I guess my visions were
		prescience after all.  How will I ever
		resolve that with my artifical con-
		science?

A creaking floorboard to Ripley's right draws her attention to
The Abbot.  He's pacing.

			ABBOT
		Do you see what you've delivered us
		into?

			RIPLEY
		Yeah.  Lead me not into temptation to
		kick your -- ahh --

Ripley tries to stand - her head spins.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		Oh shit.

The entire room THROBS with the rhythm of the wind.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the Big Boy -?

The Abbot points to the door.

			ABBOT
		On the other side of that door.
		Waiting for us to starve to death.

Ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.

			RIPLEY
		It's playing with us.  It could get in
		here any time it wants.

			ABBOT
		Why should he enter?  He knows that one
		of the people in this room is in league
		with him.

			JOHN
		Sir.  We're all in the same coracle, so
		to speak.

			ABBOT
		Maybe more than one of us.

			RIPLEY
		Let's talk about the facts, Mr. Abbot.

She looks at the windmills.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		This is your technology?

			ABBOT
		Even this is forbidden to us.

			RIPLEY
		Well then, the facts are that we're screwed.

She moves into the room.  Walks around one of the Windmills.

			RIPLEY
		An Eco system.  Nothing to recycle your
		atmosphere except the green plants.  Winds
		generated down here --
		     (looks at the floor)
		Windmills use the natural surface winds
		to turn wheels underground, create tides
		on the seas to recirculate your water...

			ANTHONY
		More than that.  There are pumps beneath
		the floor - I can feel their vibration.

			RIPLEY
		Probably pumping this air through charcoal
		filters.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			RIPLEY
		It gets colder all the time here, right?

John looks at her questioningly.

			JOHN
		Yes...

			RIPLEY
		Your wood burning fires throw soot into
		the atmosphere, building the cloud layer -
		cutting off the sun's rays - cooling the
		planet, forcing you to burn more wood.

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

			ANTHONY
		The Greenhouse Effect.  It's how the Earth
		almost destroyed itself in the late 20th
		century.

			RIPLEY
		Don't you see?  This is a planet set to
		self destruct.  Not in ten minutes or two
		hours but soon.  Your atmosphere here is
		finite.  If the plants die the fires will
		eat up all the oxygen - this planetoid
		will be dead - Everyone will die.

The Abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last 
few meters of a Marathon.

			ABBOT
		It's here.  I was just hoping I would be
		dead long before it came to this.

			JOHN
		What?

			ABBOT
		We're supposed to die here.  That's the point.

			RIPLEY
		Wait a minute -- you were exiled --?

			ABBOT
		The punishment for our crime was death.

Anthony sits up.

			ANTHONY
		This planet is the supreme triumph of
		planned obsolesence.  A certain amount of
		primitive materials with an atmosphere
		processing system as fragile as a real
		environment but not replenishable.

The Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...

			ABBOT
		Poetic justice for the anti-technologists.
		The Company's best work.  You know, I used
		to be a corporate executive.  Middle range
		V.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.
		I chucked it all and joined the order.
		Be a monk -- see the world.  Being here,
		being chairman of the board...

			RIPLEY
		No, now I understand why I landed here.
		To join you happy lunatics in your 
		deaths.

Ripley moves away...
John starts after her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, wait --

The Abbot stands, blocks his way.

			ABBOT
		Where can she go?  She's trapped.
		       (beat)
		Trapped inside her own prison.  A prison
		in her mind.  Inside her mind.  Dancing.
		Sparklets of light - dance with the june
		bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare
		coming to danceintheshadowof...

John and Ripley turn to look at the Abbot.
He begins to speak faster.  Faster.
He shakes.  Vibrates is more accurate --
A trickle of BLOOD runs from his left ear...

			ABBOT

		foryouuuuuuuuu --*

SPLORTCH-KT--!!
The Abbot's HEAD EXPLODES --!!!
Like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement.
Blood, bone, hair and brain matter SPRAY John.
John SCREAMS.


A HORRIBLE ALIEN HEAD BURSTER

Is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the Abbot.
It keeps it's hold on the Abbot's spinal cord -- The Abbot's
body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as
lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way
through the system.

Ripley SCREAMS.
The Infant Alien-headed corpse stumbles towards her --
She plucks Anthony's staff from the floor and SWINGS --
-- Like a child hitting a baseball from a TEE --
WHACK-K -!!
BLASTS the Chest/head burster across the room --

It hits the floor SCRAMBLING.  Scuttles down into where the
Windmills meet the floor.  Disappears.

			RIPLEY
		BASTARD!!  It came out of his fucking
		head!

			ANTHONY
		I didn't have to see that to know what
		that means.

			RIPLEY
		He sent him to us.  That bastard outside.
		I can't get away from him.  He's fucking
		with my mind.  He's my punishment!

			ANTHONY
		I'm confused.  Before you said it came out
		of the torso, not the head --

			RIPLEY
		I don't feel like a discussion of Alien biology.

John comes up next to her.

			JOHN
		Ripley, don't --

She pushes him away and sinks to the floor.

			RIPLEY
		I should just wait for the air to run out...

			JOHN
		I believe - I know - that we can win --
		there is an answer in our books.

			RIPLEY
		Your books?  Your books are gone, Brother.
		Your world is gone.  Once that thing starts
		to lay its eggs, all your brothers - if
		they aren't already - are dead.

			JOHN	
		If that's true, then all of us, the books,
		are consigned to ashes.

He clasps his hands and bows his head.
The Abbot's blood drips off his hands.
Plip - plop!
Into a little puddle at Ripley's feet.
She stares at the blood.  Aahk.
Feels the PAIN again.
Runs her hand across her chest...

			ANTHONY O/S
		Ripley?

			RIPLEY
		What?

			ANTHONY
		There are several inconsistancies between
		this and the other Aliens you described.

			RIPLEY
		Give it up.

			ANTHONY
		I think this is important.  This may help
		us fight it.  The creature that I fought
		in the hall - when I first saw it, it had
		camoflaged itself to look like wood.

Ripley looks up.
			
			RIPLEY
		Wood?  When I saw it in my room it looked
		the way it did before -- black, mechanical --
		unless that was a dream.

			ANTHONY
		I don't think it was.  I think that this 
		creature, if it is the efficient predator
		that you say it is, has the ability to
		adapt to its environment.

			RIPLEY
		Then the reason they've always looked the
		same to me is that I only ever saw them in
		the same environment.

			ANTHONY
		Or this may be an as yet unseen stage of
		development -- you saw a queen -- This
		could be like a King ant -- more highly
		advanced than the drone, bred for 
		survival -?

			JOHN
		How does this explain the thing that came
		out of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?

			RIPLEY
		Maybe it can deposit different types of
		eggs.  The chest burster is probably
		dormant until the host eats - The first
		one I ever saw came out of Kane after he
		started to eat --

And in one horrible moment she realizes:
She hasn't eaten.  The pain in her chest...

			RIPLEY
		No.

Anthony "looks" towards her - does he realize as well?

			JOHN
		No what?

			RIPLEY
		No, we're not beat yet, Father --

			JOHN
		Brother --

Ripley gets up.

			RIPLEY
		Brother.  Not yet.  If he's taunting me,
		then maybe we can use that.  We can beat
		this bastard.  We can get to my ship.
		We can live.

								CUT TO:

INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM

John stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the 
ceiling.  Holds a torch.
Ripley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed 
out in front of him.  Skin is palid.

			ANTHONY
		Don't have second thoughts.  Blind and
		crippled I would only slow you down.
		Give him time to figure out what you're
		doing.  Just leave me my staff.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  Good luck.

She shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.
Anthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.

			ANTHONY
		Ripley, I know.  Good luck.

			RIPLEY
		Sit tight.

Ripley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they
look up at the trap door on the ceiling.

			RIPLEY
		He could be waiting on the other side
		of that door.  We might not get ten feet
		before he kills the three of us.

He shakes his head.

			JOHN
		We had better go, then.

He smiles.
She smiles back.
They move up the ladder.

It leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to


AN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT

The ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John
climb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them:

AN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet,
over five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the
top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred
feet overhead.

The water sparkles with a golden glow.

			JOHN
		Must be day on the surface of the planet.

			RIPLEY
		Where is the light coming from?
	
			JOHN
		Mirrors.  Reflect the outside light down
		great shafts -- through lenses.  That's
		what they make in the glass factory. 
		Lenses.  Look --

She turns:

A HUGE WATERFALL

Lit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours
into the sea a short distance from them.

			JOHN
		Opens to the surface.  Water flows in
		and out.  I don't know how.  There's one
		at either end.  I came down on the other
		side.

			RIPLEY
		What do we do?

John points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at
the end of their ropes.

			JOHN
		We cross.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY

Anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the
bottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his
tender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.
The large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.
The wind blows through his hair.
WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
Feels good.

Anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his "eyes."

			ANTHONY
		Now the seer can only see what God wants
		him to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks
		and I've finally found religion.

A floor board CREAKS.
Anthony strains to hear:

			ANTHONY
		John?  Ripley?

WHOOSH...WHOOSH...
He knows it is not.

			ANTHONY
		Well come then.  I haven't got forever.

A shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it.
He doesn't have to see what is here.


THE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT

The leather boat makes its way across the sea.
John rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft.
As night falls she takes the oars.

The Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass-
like surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers.

			RIPLEY
		Your hands okay?

			JOHN
		They'll be fine.  You've been on
		a boat before.

Ripley squints ahead of them.
The ocean seems to go on forever.

			RIPLEY
		I was a warrant officer on a ship --
		but I did all my sailing in space.

			JOHN		
		Father Anselm used to take me on his
		coracle when I was little.

Ripley leans forward - scans his face.

			RIPLEY
		How old were you when they towed
		this satellite out here?	

			JOHN
		Five.  The Abbot said they put us to 
		sleep for the thirty years it took
		to get here.  We've had almost forty
		more.  Until now.

			RIPLEY
		What happened to your mother?

			JOHN
		Never had one.  I mean, never knew her.
		I mean, I did, once.  She left my father
		when he joined the movement.  If she
		hadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept
		the other children with the women, on
		Earth.  That was too long ago now.  Like
		a dream.

Ripley's face grows strangely dark.  She turns to the water.

			RIPLEY
		Did you know that I was a mother?

			JOHN
		The girl in the ship with -?

			RIPLEY
		No.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my
		daughter.  My daughter.  I have - had
		I guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.
		Kathy.  She was nine when I signed on to
		the Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before
		you know it I said.  My shares would have
		set us up good.  Then I lost sixty years
		floating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks
		to the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,
		70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little
		girl who's mother never came home.

			JOHN
		Jesus Christ.

			RIPLEY
		They said I should have been happy to be
		alive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went
		back the second time.  Not so I could
		fight it -- You can't fight it -- So
		I could let it kill me.

She rubs her chest --

			JOHN
		You didn't choose to get lost in space.

			RIPLEY
		Thanks for the try Father --

			JOHN
		Brother.

			RIPLEY
		Brother, but I'm not looking for absolution.
		I couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.
		I couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But
		I can be a good mother to you.  I can make
		sure you survive.

Suddenly they feel rain --
Ripley holds out her hand.
Her eyes open wide at what she sees.
John takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side:

The Ocean has become red with BLOOD.
Blood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.

			RIPLEY
		Blood.

John looks up.

			JOHN
		From the levels above.

His face goes white.

			JOHN
		He must have slaughtered all --

			RIPLEY
		Don't think about it.  Don't think about
		what's up there.  Just row.

As Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move
across the surface.
She doesn't notice.


A SHAPE

Passes underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.
Thanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.
Dwarfs their coracle.


INT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - NIGHT

All the windmills are BURNING.
Flaming arms lazily turning.
Anthony is not in sight.
Whoosh...Whoosh...


THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN - NIGHT

Another dock with ladders going up and down.
Ripley and John climb out of the coracle.
Don't waste time tying off.  They go  --


UP THE LADDER

A hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.
Rungs have been torn away in some places.
They pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest
foothold.  The temperature rises as they do.
Sweat runs into their eyes.

Soon they can see the floor above them:
BLACKENED by intense heat.
They climb.


INT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT

Ripley and John come up from the level below.

			RIPLEY
		Holy shit.

John crosses himself.

Another testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.
Reduced to just a huge, blackened floor.
All the crops burned to ash --
Their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.
Their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --
Ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.

			JOHN
		There's Andrew.  And Raphael.  Peter...

			RIPLEY
		Stop.  How far?

			JOHN
		We're right below the Abbey now.

They cross the smoldering field.
The scorched floor threatens to give way under John's feet --
Ripley pull him to one side.


THE MONASTERY LEVEL

Heaven has become HELL.
The ground, the buildings, the Sky-timber - all blackened.
FIRES burn everywhere.  Air choked with gray smoke and dust
pouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the
vaulted ceiling.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's 
hinges.  They look at the grim tableau:

Monks impaled on their own pikes.
Tangled together in their own pungy stakes.
Alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.


THE MONASTERY

Flickering fires lit the first few floor windows.
Ripley takes a step towards it --
Reaches back and pulls John...


INT. GLASS FACTORY - NIGHT

The Glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow.
Small fires burn out of control around the room.
Finished glass pieces BURST from the heat.
Ripley and John enter.

			JOHN
		This is the glassworks.  They have
		tools here --
			(spots)
		Kyle --

He runs across the room --


BROTHER KYLE

Sits calmly at the Marver table.
He places playing cards on the table in front of him.
Solitaire.  
He sings to himself quietly.

			KYLE
		     (sotto)
		Can't see my baby.
		Don't see my baby.  Bay be.

John grabs him by the lapels - pulls him to his feet.
The playing cards fall to the floor --
Kyle watches them, not John.

			JOHN
		Kyle.  Brother Kyle.

			KYLE
		Cards on the floor, fifty two pickup.
		Black king on red queen, put the
		ace up --

John SHAKES him.

			JOHN
		Kyle goddammit!

Ripley moves closer.

			RIPLEY
		John - it's too late --

Kyle begins to sing faster.  Faster.

			KYLE
		Ace up.  Put the ace up.  Redaceupup.
		Blackaceup.Up.Pup-pup-pup-chaka-
		boomloommawhacka -- Booomalooma
		looma --

Ripley and John look at each other.
They know what this means.
John pulls a length of rope off a nearby table.
Moves in front of Kyle.  Looks into his glassy eyes.
A tear runs down his cheek.

			JOHN
		Keep singing, my friend.

John loops the rope around Kyle's neck.
Strangles him.
Eases the lifeless body to the floor.
Stares at it.


RIPLEY

Pulls a blowing iron from the rack.  Feels its weight and
balance.  A reasonable weapon.  She crosses to John.

			JOHN
		I killed him.  I'm a doctor and I
		killed him.

			RIPLEY
		You had to.  You're supposed to end
		suffering.

She hands him a pontil, a pointed iron spear used to form the
molten glass shapes.

			RIPLEY
		Let's get the hell out of here.


INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Ripley and John move up the stairs.
Flickering orange lit from below.
Smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors.


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

They enter carefully.  The room is exactly as John left it,
books out of shelves, hanging on their chains.

			RIPLEY
		He's made a mess.

John pushes ahead of her.

			JOHN
		No.  He hasn't been up here yet.  I 
		did this.

He moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open
the lock --

			JOHN
		Here - philosophy - we'll start here --

AAAROO --!
A HAIRY BLUR flies out from between the stacks --
WHUMPH!  Knocks John to the floor --
Licks his face.

			JOHN
		Mattias!

The happy dog leaps all over his master.

			JOHN		
		He waited.  Ripley, this is Mattias.  My
		dog.  Good fellow.

Ripley crosses to them.

			RIPLEY
		I'm glad.  Really.  But we've probably
		only got a few minutes before this
		entire place goes up in flames.  Just
		grab whatever books you want and --

Ripley leans in to pet Mattias.
Mattias draws his lip back.  Growls.
He's looking over Ripley's shoulder.

She turns around slowly...


THE ALIEN

Standing in the open doorway.
It's in bad shape from the man traps.
Lost a foot.  Tongue hanging out, useless.
Parts of it look like wood.  Parts of it look like wheat.

It carries Anthony's waterlogged, limp body --
POPS off his head like a grape from the bunch.
Tosses the corpse at Ripley's feet.

I could swear it's trying to smile.


RIPLEY AND JOHN

Back against the book stacks.
John grabs Mattias' collar.
The Dog GROWLS at the Alien intruder...

			JOHN
		Easy, boy...

			RIPLEY
		Is there another way out?

			JOHN
		Not that will do us any good.


THE ALIEN

Limps into the room dragging one foot.
It's breathing is labored.  Dripping acid blood leaves a thin
trail of fire behind it.

			JOHN
		We hurt it.

The Alien draws itself up to its full height --
Even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker.

			RIPLEY
		You wanna give it a bandage?  Look --
		Where is my ship from here?

			JOHN
		On the roof directly above this room.

			RIPLEY
		Here's the plan --
		
			JOHN
		But the books --

			RIPLEY
		Forget the books!

RUFF!!
Mattias pulls free from John's grasp --
Runs to the Alien --

			RIPLEY
		Shit.


MATTIAS

Snaps and barks at the Alien --
Leaping about to dodge its claws.
Draws its attention --


RIPLEY AND JOHN

RUN at the Alien.
It is trying to spear the dog with its tail.
John swings the iron rod -- THWAP -!
HITS the Alien across the back of its bulbous head --

It turns to him --

SPLIIIITCH -!
Ripley SHOVES the blowing iron into the Alien's torso.
His acid blood SPURTS out the end of the hollow tube --
SPLATTERS Ripley's cassock - she TEARS it off --

John grabs Mattias -- pulls him back.

The Alien SPINS in a circle --
Blood SPRAYING around him -

Creating a CIRCLE OF FIRE about him --
IGNITING the books --

			JOHN
		No!  THE BOOKS!!

			RIPLEY
		Don't --!

John steps forward -- Ripley grabs for him --
The ACID EATS through the wooden floor --


THE FLOOR COLLAPSES

The Alien, John and Ripley PLUMMET down -!
THROUGH the next floor --


INTO THE GLASSWORKS

The Alien FALLS into the molten glass vat --
SCREECHES - arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of
the thousand degree liquid.


JOHN

Finds himself HANGING over the bubbling glass vat - Caught -
DANGLING on the Flying Fox rope.  Five feet away - the ledge the
Flying Fox is launched from.  He looks down:

He can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him.  To its
right, the Water DUMP TANK - a large wine cask-looking affair
where finished pieces are cooled.  He looks up:

Ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above.

			JOHN
		Are you all right?

Ripley grunts an affirmative response.
At least is she falls, it will only be a twenty-foot drop to
the floor.  John is looking at instant par-boiling.
John starts to move hand over hand UP the rope.  He begins to
sweat.
A drop of sweat falls...
HSSS!
POPS AND SIZZLES as it hits the surface of the molten glass --


RIPLEY

Tries to pull herself up to the floor above --
The next level is a raging fire.

She can only hang and DROP.  She DOES -!
Falls the two stories.
Bends her knees and ROLLS on impact.


JOHN

Has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace.
He stands.  Sees Ripley slowly rising --

			JOHN
		Ripley -!

Ripley shakily gets to her feet.
Hops on one foot.

			RIPLEY
		Aargh.  I'm fine.  Let's get the fuck
		out of --

SUDDENLY

THE ALIEN'S head breaks the surface of the molten glass.
SCREAMING.  STEAMING.  It is white-hot -
translucent -- covered with -- 
It looks like MOLTEN GLASS!!

Hook-like hands grasp the edge of the tank --
It tries to climb out --

Ripley turns to run.  Tender ankle gives out.
She falls face down on the floor --
Rolls over --

THE ALIEN is going to climb out of the vat --
She SCREAMS --


JOHN

Grabs the Flying Fox handle.
SWINGS down the rope - across the room --
PAST the Alien --

It turns away from Ripley -
She scrambles across the floor...

John lands HARD.
Points --

			JOHN
		Ripley - the lever!!

Ripley looks next to her:  a burning wooden lever.

The Alien has one foot out of the glass furnace --

RIPLEY grabs the lever -- Hssssst!
Putting out the fire with her hand --
Pulls --


THE HUGE DUMP TANK OF WATER

DUMPS.  Empties a thousand gallons --
RAINS DOWN on the Alien. 
It HOWLS in pain --

The Molten Glass instantly COOLS --
The rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to
BE-THWOOOoooOOM -!!
EXPLODE into a million pieces...!!!!

Ripley helps John off the floor.
They are battered.  Bloody.
They look into the vat.
The steam clears...

The room is littered with Alien Bits.
Each piece is encased in glass --
Trapped like a fly in amber.

			JOHN
		Saw that happen to a bottle once.

			RIPLEY
		    (panting)
		Beat... Beat him - ugh --

She grabs her stomach as her knees give out.
John gives her an arm for support.

			JOHN
		We've got to get to the Library --

			RIPLEY
		Don't worry.  Ship.  Just --

They look up:

Mattias looks down through the hole in the floor.
BARKS...


INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

An INFERNO.
Every bookshelf ablaze.  The floor dotted with pools of flame.
Ripley and John are at the door - held back by the heat --

John tries to enter the room --
Ripley grabs him --

			RIPLEY
		Don't be stupid --

			JOHN
		Some of them!  I've got to save some of
		them!  Mattias!!

Mattias yelps in response.  Threads his way through to them.
Ripley spins him to face her.  Tears stream down his cheeks.

			RIPLEY
		They're lost.  You did your best.  If
		you get out, it wasn't in vain.
		We've got to live!!

She YANKS him into the hallway --

							CUT TO:

EXT. MONASTERY - THE ROOF - NIGHT

Ripley's good foot KICKS down the burning planks that surround
the escape ship.  John and Mattias stand behind as she climbs
through to the ship.  John looks around:

The ABBEY LEVEL is devastated.  The air is filled with smoke.
The Abbey is burning.  The Library is in flames.

John looks down at his medical bag.
Torn, bloody, scorched, it still hangs from his shoulders.
Inside: The only remaining book.

			RIPLEY O/S
		Come on in!

John and Mattias step through --


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 - NIGHT

Ripley CLICKS on the lights.
John lifts Mattias into the hatch.

			JOHN
		The Library --

			RIPLEY
		I told you -- the Earth is still there --

Ripley checks an instrument:  Elapsed travel time.
Her brows knit.  She TAPS the gauge.

			RIPLEY
		Not working.

			JOHN
		What does that mean?

			RIPLEY
		It means I don't know how long I was
		in hyper sleep.

			JOHN
		It means the Abbot could've been right --
		
			RIPLEY
		It means my clock isn't working.  We have
		to get out of here.  Even if he was right
		this ship's onboard computer is filled 
		with man's knowledge.

			JOHN
		Not everything.  Some things will be
		lost forever. 

			RIPLEY
		Then man starts over.  He's done it
		before.

She pushes a few buttons.  Somewhere under the floor a 
propulsion source HUMS to life.  THROBBING through the soles
of John's feet.  Ripley is absorbed in her work.

			RIPLEY
		Okay.  The seals weren't broken so
		we're probably clear.  But those dead
		monks out there are going to start
		hatching soon.  Let's get ready to
		take off.

			JOHN
		What can I do?

			RIPLEY
		Here, I need a compressor tank from
		in that compartment.

She motions towards an open door.
John enters the compartment.
Whoosh-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

			JOHN
		Hey!  What?!

He looks out the window in the door.  

Ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the
door.

			JOHN
		Hey - I'm locked in.

Mattias scratches at the door.

			RIPLEY
		I know.  I locked you in.

			JOHN
		What?

			RIPLEY
		I'm not going with you.  I've got one
		inside me.
	
			JOHN
		What?!  You can't --

She runs a hand across her midsection.

			RIPLEY
		I figured it out.  That's why it didn't
		kill me.  He must have impregnated me
		when I was in the stasis tube.
		    (remembers nightmare)
		It hasn't come out yet because I 
		haven't eaten, It's still dormant.  So
		either I eat and it kills me or I don't
		eat and I starve to death.  Either way 
		I die.

John pulls the Medieval Tome out of his medical bag.

			JOHN	
		My book -- I know what to do --

			RIPLEY
		What, an exorcism?  No good.

			JOHN
		You can't do this.  Ripley - listen
		to me - you're confusing feeling of
		guilt for actual sin - I can help you --

			RIPLEY
		    (ignoring)
		I've set a time lock.  When the pod escapes
		the Colony's gravitational pull this
		compartment will open.  Then all you have 
		to do is get into the Stasis tube with
		Mattias and press the blue button.  With
		any luck a freighter or something will
		pick you up.  Good luck.

He pounds his fists against the door.

			JOHN
		NO!  No, Goddammit - you can't do this.
		You can't let it win.

She turns away from the door.

			RIPLEY
		It always wins.  We killed it, but it's
		still inside me -- You're my last chance.
		If I can keep you alive it'll make up
		for all those I've lost.

			JOHN
		Listen to me!  You have to let me try!
		Ripley:  You're MY only chance!

She's listening...

			JOHN
		I told you Father Anselm raised me.
		He raised me and when he was dying I
		couldn't do anything to save him.  I 
		didn't know enough.  It was my fault
		he died.  If you don't let me try to
		save you my body will live but my soul
		will be dead.

Ripley turns and stares at him.

			JOHN
		Please.

THE PAGE

A MEDIEVAL ETCHING.
A Monk vomits up the devil.

Pull back as John lowers Ripley to the pod floor.
John closes his eyes.
Closes the book.

He pours some water into a small plastic cup.
Retrieves a small pouch of herbs.  Opens it.
Wrinkles his nose - they smell --
pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup.

			RIPLEY
		What is this stuff?

			JOHN
		     (forceful)
		Something that will make you well.
		Something that will make you sick.

			RIPLEY
		I don't --

			JOHN
		Shut up and drink.

He lifts the back of Ripley's head --
FORCES the drink down her throat.

John swings his leg over her midsection.  STRADDLES her.
Presses his two hands together in prayer.
Then balls them into one fist.
Takes a deep, preparatory breath...

Ripley starts to GAG -- Cough.
Her body starts to JERK --

John BRINGS HIS FIST DOWN INTO HER STOMACH --
WHAMM -!!

Ripley CONVULSES -- has the dry heaves --

WHAM!  WHAM --!
John PUMMELS Ripley's diaphragm!

She sputters -- VOMITS a thick mucous-like substance --
HEAVES --

Ripley's back arches --
She SCREAMS a gut wrenching WAIL --
Her torso BULGES as the creature is forced upwards.

John BEARS down --
Pushes UP under her ribs --
FORCING the chest-burster up her throat --

Ripley fights for air as the alien STOPS halfway up her 
esophagus -- She's choking --

John crosses himself -- takes a deep breath --
Lowers his mouth to hers --
Inhales.  Exhales.  CPR.


THE ALIEN CHEST BURSTER

SLITHERS out of Ripley's mouth --

INTO JOHN'S!!
Reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet.

John falls back against a computer console.
Gagging.  Fights to speak.

Ripley raises herself up on one elbow.
Alien mucous drooling down her chin.
Hair matted against her forehead.

			RIPLEY
		Why?
	
			JOHN
		Choking.  It was the only way.

He drops the open book in front of her:
She sees the etching.


JOHN

Gulps back the oozing slime.
Struggles to his feet.

			JOHN
		They knew.

			RIPLEY
		But you --

Ripley tries to stand - to go after him --
She can't sit up -- feels like a rib might be cracked.

			RIPLEY
		You'll die --

John stumbles to the Pod door.  Turns back.

			JOHN	
		That's idea.  Join...my brothers.  If
		we were right, Heaven.  If we were wrong --
		either way, where we belong.  World of
		books.  Pages.

He draws the parchment out of his bag.
Drops it to the floor.

			JOHN
		You... are from the real world.

He starts to step through the door --
Mattias tries to follow.

			JOHN
		Stay -- both of you.

He exits the Pod.

Ripley drags herself across the floor.

			RIPLEY
		No - wait!  John!

To the Door.  Looks out:


BROTHER JOHN

Dawn's rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he
walks slowly across the smoking roof.
Into the inferno that is the burning Abbey.

Ripley watches as John and the alien horror inside him are
INCINERATED.

The heat of the flames grows.
She must pull back --
Reaches up for the door handle.
It closes with a THUD.

She rolls onto her back.
She weeps.  For the first time in years.
She's been absolved.

CREeeek -!!
The escape pod SHIFTS.
Ripley's eyes SNAP open --

The Roof beneath the Pod is beginning to GIVE WAY.

Ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the
pilot's chair.  Pulls herself into the seat.
Straps herself in --


SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4

Blasts THROUGH the wooden outershell of the Orbiter Arceon.
ROARS towards us - past us.


INT. SULACCO ESCAPE POD #4 = DAY

Ripley places Mattias into the Hyper sleep tube.
Rubs under his chin.  Is about to climb in with him when she
spots something on the floor --


JOHN'S PARCHMENT

Ripley picks it up and unrolls it.
She hears John's voice:

			JOHN V.O.
		I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter
		Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know
		the Abbot was wrong.  There is a great
		evil here.  I have seen it.  I put pen to
		paper now lest this plague - this creature
		stills my hand.  I have gone down below -
		both to try to warn the others and get 
		the woman - Ripley - get from her some
		clue as to how to battle this evil, or
		at least to make my peace for not
		defending her.  She believes there is
		still and Earth and I hope she is right.
		I hope she will be able to find out.
		I hope she can find some rest for the
		devils that torment her.

Ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command
console.  Pulls a pen from it's holder.  She adds:

			RIPLEY V.O.
		Whether the Earth exists or not, whether
		we end up in Heaven, or Hell, or the cold
		vacuum of space, she has.

She sets her course.
Gets back into her tube.
Closes the lid.


DEEP SPACE

The escape pod moves through the jet-black void...


ARCEON

Dwindles into the darkness behind her, a smouldering, slowly
dying ember...

FADE IN:

EXT.  MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)

A LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering
just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.
The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-
scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its
true shape and appearance indistinct.

The VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then
pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles
and personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted
scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the
armed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on
the horizon.  Waiting.

The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it
moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a
second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards
behind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck
beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes
glued to the distant object.

The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked
local TV van, finds the object again in the distance,
zooms in, and waits, like everyone else.

Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box
CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.

			CRAIS
	That was the scene in California's
	Mojave Desert three years ago today
	-- the historic first view of the
	Newcomer ship upon its dramatic
	arrival.  As with the assassination
	of John Kennedy, who among us does
	not remember exactly where he was
	that October nineteenth morning,
	when news first broke: that people
	have landed... from another star.

We PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal...


INT.  A CROWDED BAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar.

The off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly
ignoring the TV, except for two detectives, FEDORCHUK and
ALTEREZ, who are waiting for the ball scores.

			FEDORCHUK
	I remember where I was -- pissing
	off my balcony at the neighbor's
	dog!

Others laugh.

			ALTEREZ
		   (yells at Crais on TV)
	Get to the goddamn ball scores!

ON THE TV SCREEN, an on-location interview with a CAL-TECH
PROFESSOR comes up.  Her name and title appear across the
bottom of the screen.

			CAL-TECH PROFESSOR
	From the time mankind first gazed up
	at the stars there had been
	speculation about a visit by people
	from "out there."  How ironic that
	when that first contact was made,
	the two hundred and sixty thousand
	occupants aboard the craft were as
	surprised as we were about their
	arrival.  That they awakened from
	frozen hibernation to find their
	malfunctioning autopilot had landed
	them here by mistake.

The CNN reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again.

			CRAIS
	These "Newcomers," we soon learned,
	were a genetically-engineered race,
	adapted for hard labor in almost any
	environmental condition.  In effect,
	their ship was a slave ship...
	washed ashore on Earth with no way
	to get back to where they came
	from...

A dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses CUTS ACROSS
FRAME, and we PAN WITH IT as it is slammed down on the
countertop.

Now an interview with a FRESNO HOUSEWIFE standing outside
a supermarket comes on the TV SCREEN.

			FRESNO HOUSEWIFE
	When the Newcomers were first let
	out of the ship, they were
	quarantined in a camp not ten miles
	from the town here.  You can imagine
	how the people around here felt
	about that.  But once they were
	releases from the camp and we got a
	chance to know them, we saw what
	nice, quiet people they really are...

WIDER

revealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white
busboy's uniform.  His back is to us as he picks up two
trays from the counter.  The bartender is dwarfed by this
Newcomer, but works around him without apparent concern.
Fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy.

			FEDORCHUK
	Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?
	Workin' hard?

The Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but
disturbingly alien.

			FEDORCHUK
	You got your green card, buddy?  You
	didn't leave home without it?

The cops at the bar crack up.  Henry looks at Fedorchuk --
his eyes carrying no malice... or pain.  He merely blinks.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - STREET - NIGHT

An explosion of color and movement as OPENING TITLES PLAY
very quickly.  We're TRAVELING the streets in a n.d.
sedan, getting MOVING GLIMPSES of the aliens living among
us now:

-- A coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables.

-- A Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of
books.

-- A city park where a number of alien families have
gathered to play some arcane alien game.

			SYKES
	Jeez... they call that gang-bang a
	game...?

-- A billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien.

-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light.
Suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes'
head... and alien hand.  Sykes jumps.  It's a NEWCOMER
DERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own
language.  In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of
milk.  We know immediately what he wants.  Sykes rolls
down the window.

			SYKES
	Take a hike.

Sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light
changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the
street.  Sykes grimaces at the smell.

			SYKES
	Why's it have to be sour milk that
	these guys get wasted on?  What the
	hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or
	Thunderbird for chrissakes?
		   (beat; disgusted)
	Slagtown.  Shit...

-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes.

-- Alien hookers plying their trade.

			SYKES
	Hope their plumbing's the same.

			TUGGLE
	It is.
		   (and Sykes gives him
		    a look)

-- A Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile.

-- An alien couple exit a theater playing "Terminator
III".

-- An alien wig shop.

ANGLE

TITLES END, and we start to PULL BACK into the slug-mobile
and HEAR:

			TUGGLE (O.S.)
	So you gonna go, or you not gonna
	go?


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

The dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two
coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the
windshield.  A hand picks up one of the coffees and we
FOLLOW IT to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen
some wear and tear -- behind the wheel is MATT SYKES.
Beside him is his partner of nine years, BILL TUGGLE.
Tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.

			SYKES
	How can I go?

			TUGGLE
	Put on your wash-and-wear suit and
	your clip-on tie, have your landlady
	tie your shoes for you, and show up
	at the church.  Simple.
		   (beat)
	Me and Carol are going.

			SYKES
	What?

			TUGGLE
	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin
	since... since she was conceived in
	that cabin up in Big Bear.
	Remember?  You and Edie banged the
	wall so hard, me and Carol were
	picking plaster out of our hair for
	a week...

			SYKES
	Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see
	Kristin get married, okay?  But--

			TUGGLE
	But you're bummed because your ex
	and her new husband are paying for
	the whole thing.

			SYKES
	Shit, if Kristin had to get married
	where I could afford it, we'd be
	holding the reception at Buddy's
	Burgers.

Sykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed-off
mood.  Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop
radar.

			SYKES
	Uh-oh... Check it out.

THROUGH THE WINDOW Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two ALIENS
in long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom-
and-pop mini-mart on the corner.  One of them wears dark
glasses and a red bandana (KIPLING): the other has on a
black vinyl raincoat.

			SYKES
	Does that look at all suspicious to
	you?

			TUGGLE
	Whatever gave you that idea?


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb
among other parked cars.


INT.  SEDAN - NIGHT

Sykes is already pulling his gun.  Tuggle quickly reaches
for the radio in the glovebox.

			TUGGLE
	This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a
	possible two-eleven in progress at
	Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court
	and Alvarado.  Requesting backup.

Impulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing
out.

			SYKES
	Let's do it, partner.

Tuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio
Dispatcher confirms the call.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked
cars across the street from the mini-mart.  Through the
store window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the
counter.  His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat
and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it
right at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun
and covers the door.

Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.

			SYKES
	You got your vest?

			TUGGLE
	Of course.  Right in the trunk of
	the car.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.

Through the store window the robbery continues in
pantomime.  Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,
yelling orders in the alien language.  The Proprietor is
quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.
The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands
in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The
Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.

Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the
street from the store entrance.

			TUGGLE
	Watch the driver.  I'm going for a
	better angle on the door.

			SYKES
	I got him.  Don't get pinned.

Tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-
corner across the intersection.

Through the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag
of cash, shove it in his coat pocket.  Bills fall out, but
he doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up
the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's
chest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,
slides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and
FIRES another round into the Proprietor.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	Aw, shit.

Tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the
shots.

The human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a
few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots
Tuggle.  He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine
pistol on the seat next to him.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk.  They
spot Tuggle through the store window and open fire --
BLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS.

A civilian car enters the intersection.  The engine is hit
by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the
intersection, steam rising from the radiator.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Tuggle dives behind a lamp post.

The Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine
pistol to fire at Tuggle.  Sykes sees this and opens fire
at the Driver.  The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.
Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is
sprayed with bullets.

A forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between
Sykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is
standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He
rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.

Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the
shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.

			SYKES
	Get outta there!

			TUGGLE
	I can't!  Do you mind!

			SYKES
	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!

Sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway
car, firing toward the store as he goes.

Kipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.

Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp
post and runs to the stalled civilian car.  He slides
across the hood and drops behind the car for cover.
Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car
window.  His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver
who is still inside the car.

			OLD MAN
	Can I get out now?

			TUGGLE
	Move it!

Sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in
the store.  As he considers his next move--

Tuggle fires at the two aliens.  They return fire and he
slides down to safety behind the car.  Or so he thinks.
Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by
the shotgun blasts.  He flinches as another blast hits the
car.  He looks over.  There's a big exit hole in the
fender beside him.  THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.
Another exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.

Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS
and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of
the car.  He has nowhere left to go and--

-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely
in the chest throwing him back onto the street.

Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of
nine years blown away.

Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his
shotgun CLICKS empty.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit
of the store.  The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands.
The two of them run out the back.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body.  One glance is
enough.  Nobody ever looked deader.

			SYKES
	Aw shit, Tug, Jesus!  Goddamn it!

He stares, shocked and incredulous.  He can't find a way
to think or feel about this.  Then we see him going crazy
right before our eyes, the rage revving.  He takes off
toward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching
in background.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken
glass, bangs through the exit.


EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round
the corner at the far end of the alley.  He takes off,
quickly cranking up to full speed.


EXT.  BACK STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds the corner.  Doesn't see them anymore.  He
slows... moves along this street with some caution.  Lots
of shadows, lots of hiding places.  Sykes HEARS a NOISE,
looks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge
billboard.  He cuts loose with the shotgun.  Sykes dives.
Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the
night.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the
crates.

Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings
down off the fire escape, runs off.

Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.


EXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.
The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up
ahead.  Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.


INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT

The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves
through the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so
he can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing
along the asphalt.

Then he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid
footsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from
which direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges
for him with an alien CRY.

It's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just
in time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat
alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the
blasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an
inhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes
with outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and
FIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down
and stays down.

Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS
it... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes
looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly
above!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold
onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the
gun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming
the gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet,
but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel.

A SIREN is HEARD approaching in background.

Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he
draws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND
again.

SYKES' P.O.V.

Though his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look
at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The
strands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.

ANGLE

The alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching
SIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings
onto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and
leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.

ON SYKES

dazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS
approaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused.

SYKES' P.O.V.

An OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him.

ANGLE

Sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his
weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien
face.  The alien, caught by surprise and off balance,
sprawls backward OUT OF FRAME.  Sykes is grabbed by a
human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.

			HUMAN COP
	Whoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy.
		   (to alien on the
		    ground)
	You okay?

Sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus.  He looks at
the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet
away.  The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON.

			JETSON
	I am all right.

He gets up.  A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.

			HUMAN COP
	I better call in.

He moves off.  Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat
alien's body.  Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might
retaliate in some way.  But Jetson simply steps past him
to kneel beside the dead alien.  He checks for a pulse on
the underside of the dead alien's upper arm.  Nothing.
Sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain.  He
struggles to rise.  Jetson gets an arm around him to help
him up.

			JETSON
	Your hand will require attention.

Sykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip.

			SYKES
	Get the hell away from me!  I don't
	need your goddamn help.

He almost loses his balance and has to steady himself
against the tunnel wall.  Sykes leans there, the picture
of impotent rage and frustration.  Jetson looks at him,
with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit
when trying to understand human nature.


EXT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

OPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over
his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the
Coroner's wagon.

WIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.  The
Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD
black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of
them aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some
alien).  He moves into:


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

The CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs
out of the wall, photographing everything.  Several
UNIFORMED COPS mill around.  Sykes moves aimlessly around
the room like a stranger at a party.

The Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange
rigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from
her lips.  A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get
her away from the body, but can't get her to budge.

MINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the
Raincoat alien dropped here.  NATUZZI, a mean-looking
veteran uniform cop is with him.

			NATUZZI
	Looks like a standard combat pump-
	action.

			MINKLER
	It is.

			NATUZZI
	So what punched holes clear through
	that car out there?

Minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box.
Inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.

			MINKLER
	BRI Sabot slugs.  These puppies are
	nasty.  Two plastic sabots fall away
	in flight leaving a fifty-caliber
	slug going two thousand feet per
	second.  Tug might as well've been
	hiding behind a rosebush.

Minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him.
He looks.  It's Sykes.

			NATUZZI
	Pretty heavy artillery for knocking
	over a liquor store.

A new voice enters the conversation.

			JETSON (O.S.)
	An identical round was used in the
	shooting of a Newcomer named
	Hubley, two days ago.

Sykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to
see the voice is Jetson's.

			MINKLER
	Yeah?  So why the extra fire power?

			JETSON
	Perhaps because even the larger
	caliber handguns aren't always
	effective against my people.

			SYKES
		   (mulls this, then)
	You saying there's some connection
	to this other homicide?

Before Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to
the Proprietor's Wife steps up.

			FEMALE COP
	Hey, give me a hand with this woman,
	will ya Jetson?  We've got to get
	her to Division for her statement
	and she won't budge.

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes)
	Excuse me.

And he moves off with his partner.  Sykes calls after him,
but Jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't
turn.

			SYKES
	So, you think there's a connection,
	or what?  Hey!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  SYKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The slug-mobile pulls up.  A drained Sykes moves up the
walk to his front door.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place
decorated with negative taste.  It's obviously the maid's
decade off.

By rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering
machine on his way into the kitchen.  The tape rewinds.
He opens the fridge.  Not much here.  Left-over take-out
pizza carton.  Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons.
Left-over take-out burger wrappers. 

The answering machine message begins -- he glances over
his shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE.  During the
following, he reaches the fridge.  Brings out a milk
carton that's in his way, sets it on the counter.  Reaches
in again and this time brings out a bottle of Stoly.  Then
searches for a semi-clean glass.

			KRISTIN'S VOICE
		   (bouncy, bride-to-be
		    happy)
	Hi, Daddy, it's me.  I'm over at
	Danny's parents' house... talking
	about Sunday.  I thought maybe you'd
	be home by now.  Anyway, uh, nothing
	really.  I just wanted to call and
	say I love you.  I love you, Daddy.
		   (she giggles)
	Uh-oh, I shouldn't'a done that.
	Knowing you, you'll probably pull
	this tape out of your machine and
	save it -- in that drawer where you
	keep every card I ever gave you, and
	all of my old baby teeth... gross!
	Anyway, Daddy, don't save this tape
	-- but I do love you, and I'll talk
	to you before Sunday.
		   (beat)
	Oh, Tug and Carol came by and met
	Danny last week.
		   (Sykes stiffens)
	Danny thought Tug was the greatest
	-- but, then, who doesn't?  Anyway,
	love you, talk to you soon.  'Bye.

The machine BEEPS and HISSES.  Sykes take the glass and
the bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room,
switching off the answering machine as he goes.

Then he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of
the machine and tosses it into a drawer.

				    FADE TO:

INT.  DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Sykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee.  He's slept about
four hours, and his face looks like he went a few with
Hagler.  He crosses straight to Fedorchuk's desk.

			SYKES
	So what've you got on Tuggle's
	killers?

			FEDORCHUK
	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than
	ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on
	it, okay?

			SYKES
	You don't have squat.

			FEDORCHUK
	You ever try to make a case in
	Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer
	informants is about as long as the
	list of Mexican war heroes...

			ALTEREZ
	Up yours.

			FEDORCHUK
	... Nobody talks to nobody down
	there.  Half of them don't speak
	English and the other half only when
	it suits them.  It's gonna take some
	time.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I know it's gonna take time.
	Like until the Ice Capades opens in
	Hell, with you two on it.

Across the room, the Captain's door BANGS open and CAPTAIN
WARNER pounds out, his deep voice booming through the
squad room.

			WARNER
	Nobody wanders off!  I got an
	announcement.  Get your asses back
	in here.

Two detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into
the room.  Everybody gathers around, curious, as Warner
stands holding a sheet of paper.

			WARNER
	I'll make this short.  This is a
	directive from Chief Evaner, who is
	acting on orders from the Mayor, who
	is under mandate from the Federal
	Bureau of Newcomer Relations.  As of
	nine o'clock this morning, one
	Newcomer uniform officer has been
	promoted to the rank of Detective,
	third grade.

The detectives GROAN... some angrier ones grumble, "This
is bullshit!", etc.

			WARNER
	And we've got him, gentleman.
		   (more groans)
	Volunteers for duty with the new
	detective should see me in my
	office... otherwise I will choose a
	volunteer myself.  That is all.

He turns and heads back to his office in the wake of
continued grumbling from the detectives.  Sykes, standing
to one side, absently watches Warner return to his glass-
walled office.  Waiting inside are a balding man and an
alien in a grey suit.  Sykes reacts.  The alien in the
suit is Jetson.

The grumbling continues around him as Sykes considers
something.

			FEDORCHUK
	Unbelievable bullshit.

			ALTEREZ
	How long has this Slag been on the
	force?  A year, max -- right?

			DETECTIVE
	I don't know about the rest of you,
	but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit
	still for this.  I'm calling the
	union, pronto.

Others grumble.  "Yeah!".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided
something.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk
sees this.

			FEDORCHUK
	Where the hell is he going?


INT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sykes KNOCKS and enters.

			WARNER
	Yeah, Sykes?

			SYKES
	Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for
	duty with the new detective.

Warner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes.

			WARNER
	... All right.  Detective Sergeant
	Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson.

			JETSON
	We have met.

Warner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes,
starting to smell something fishy.

The balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands.

			GOLDRUP
	Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office.
	Congratulations, gentlemen.

Warner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to.

			WARNER
		   (to Sykes)
	You are to have nothing to do with
	the investigation into Bill Tuggle's
	death.  You know that.  Leave that
	for Fedorchuk.

			SYKES
		   (nodding)
	Departmental policy.

			WARNER
		   (to Jetson)
	You?

			JETSON
	Yes, sir.

			WARNER
	Good.

			SYKES
	There's another case I'd like to
	take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer
	named Hubley.

Jetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something.
Sykes avoids his look.

			WARNER
	Granger and Pitts are already on it.

			SYKES
	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a
	caseload... and I would have thought
	with Jetson here being the first
	Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's
	body being found over in the
	Newcomer community...

			WARNER
	Don't tell me what to think.

			GOLDRUP
	He's got a point.  That's the sort
	of thing we should be doing with
	this early advancement program...

Long-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally
sighs with resignation.  Sykes grins.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

The steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next
to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks
like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all
the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during:

			SYKES
	... and we work my hours.  I'll do
	the driving, you do the paperwork.
	You gotta learn it so you might as
	well do it all.

			JETSON
		   (after a moment)
	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you
	for what you're doing.

			SYKES
	What's that?
		   (then realizing)
	Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in
	your head.  We're not pals, we're
	not married, and we ain't gonna take
	long moonlight walks together...
	We're just partners.  And don't call
	me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or
	Matt if you have to.

			JETSON
	I am George.

Sykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half
steps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up
cold.

			SYKES
	Wait a minute.  George?  George
	Jetson?

Jetson nods... he's used to this.
Sykes cracks up.

			SYKES
		   (between laughs)
	Man, somebody really hung one on
	you!  I've heard some good ones for
	you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley
	Davidson.  I guess the people at
	immigration got a little punchy
	after a while, coming up with names
	for a quarter of a million of you.
	You weren't at the back of the line,
	were you, George?

			JETSON
	My true name is Ss'tangya
	T'ssorentsa'.

			SYKES
	Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I
	stick to George, do you?


EXT.  POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY

They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Anyway, what's it matter to you if
	we think it's funny, right?  Whatta
	you care?

			JETSON
	That is exactly so.
		   (completely deadpan)
	It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm
	sure it doesn't bother you at all
	that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss",
	two words in my language which mean
	"excrement" and "cranium".

Sykes looks at him, perplexed.

			JETSON
	"Shit... head".

Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing
there, the smirk dropping from his face.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAY

They're cruising along in downtown traffic.  Sykes drives.
Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat.

			SYKES
	Let's talk Hubley.

			JETSON
		   (refers to a folder
		    he holds)
	His body was discovered three days
	ago, in an alley off of Central
	Avenue, near downtown.

			SYKES
	With two BRI Sabot slugs in the
	chest.

			JETSON
		   (gently correcting
		    him)
	Through the chest.  Rupturing both
	the primary and secondary hearts.

			SYKES
		   (out the window)
	Nice signal, dickwad!

Jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes.
Then...

			JETSON
	He was employed at the Northwest
	Petroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He
	was manager of the Methane Facility.
	He was also a principle partner in a
	real estate venture to develop low-
	cost housing for Newcomers.

Sykes grimaces at the mention of "Newcomer housing".

			SYKES
	Terrific.  A real pillar of the
	community.
		   (beat)
	Was Hubley missing anything when
	they found him?  Was he ripped off?

			JETSON
		   (checks file)
	There was no wallet... but he was
	still wearing a watch and two rings.

			SYKES
	The guys at the mini-mart last night
	made a half-assed stab at the money
	in the till -- but I don't think
	that's what they were there for.  I
	think we got us a couple'a
	executions on our hands, George...

			JETSON
	The murder at the mini-mart is not
	our case.  The Captain said--

Sykes looks over at Jetson, pissed.

			SYKES
	Look, you want to fit in here,
	right?  You want to learn how to get
	along?

			JETSON
	Yes.

			SYKES
	Well, there's a thing about
	partners, about being somebody's
	partner.  You do for each other.
	And other people's rules don't mean
	shit.  It's the rules set up between
	the two of you, that's all that
	counts.  Understand?
		   (Jetson nods)
	Okay.  Well, my friend and partner
	was shot last night and I'm after
	the shitbag that did it.  As my
	partner, I'm asking you to respect
	me and help me find him.

Jetson considers this several moments, then--

			JETSON
	And as my partner, I ask you to
	respect me and my desire not to
	break with procedure.

Sykes stares at him, exasperated.  Without warning, he
slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy
traffic, puts it in "Park." Jetson, who is already a
little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it.
HORNS instantly go crazy behind them.

			JETSON
	What is wrong?

			SYKES
		   (very calm)
	Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get
	something straight.  You agree that
	there's a good chance these two
	shootings are somehow related,
	right?

YELLING joins the HORNS outside.  Jetson is visibly
unsettled by the chaos.

			JETSON
	Well... yes, quite possibly.

			SYKES
	Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be
	willing to accept the theory,
	George, that... possibly... by
	examining the evidence from one case
	we might shed some small ray of
	light on the other?  Does that sound
	unreasonable to you?

			JETSON
	Yes... no, it is not unreasonable.
	Although I--

			SYKES
	Great.
		   (a relieved sigh)
	Well, I'm sure glad that's settled,
	aren't you?

And with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly
out.

			SYKES
	I think we're really starting to
	click now, George -- hmmm?

Jetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

WINTER, a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading
Sykes and Jetson along the hall.  He reads on the fly from
a case file in his hand.

			WINTER
	You know I've been over all this
	with Fedorchuk and Alterez this
	morning...

			SYKES
	Come on.  You got nothin' better to
	do, cushy county job like yours.


INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

They enter briskly through a swinging door.  They move
among the tables (some occupied, some not) during:

			WINTER
	Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck.
	Anyway, according to the sheet, the
	guy you nailed outside by the car--

			SYKES
	The human?

			WINTER
	Yeah... he was one Martin Helder.
	White male, twenty-seven.  Let's
	see... wrap sheet shows one armed
	robbery conviction, a couple for
	sale of a controlled substance.
	Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke
	when you stopped his clock.

They have reached a table holding a covered body.  Winter
unceremoniously throws back the cover.  There lies the
pale naked body of the Raincoat alien.

			JETSON
	Have you identified this one?

			WINTER
	So far he's a John Doe.  Or a Sam
	Slag, if you like.

Jetson smiles slightly out of politeness.

			WINTER
	No I.D. on him and -- well, you
	know, no fingerprints -- so it could
	be tough.  Your buddies this morning
	went through the mug book but
	couldn't make a facial match.

			SYKES
	Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with
	his hands in his back pockets.

Jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter
and Sykes continue talking off to one side.

			WINTER
		   (referring to
		    Raincoat alien)
	You took this gut out, too, didn't
	you?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			WINTER
	Lucky for you, you got him in both
	of his... well, what we loosely
	refer to as... hearts.

			SYKES
	Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my
	damn gun into him.

			WINTER
	That's the way these people are.
	You don't hit both pumps you just
	piss them off.

During this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over
-- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his
face.  He leans closer, examining the palm carefully.
Then he peels back the alien's upper lip.

Jetson frowns anew, with concern this time.  He looks
around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER.
Jetson motions him over.  Jetson begins questioning him
using the alien language.  Sykes and Winter nearby, remain
oblivious.

			WINTER
	Oh, here's an extra headshot if you
	need one.
		   (hands Sykes a
		    polariod of dead
		    alien's face)
	We're just about to start cutting
	in.  You're welcome to stick around
	if you want.  It's really
	fascinating stuff.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I'll bet.

Sykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in
earnest conversation.  He only catches snatches of the
alien language.  Bentner appears very unsettled by what
Jetson is telling him.  In response to Jetson's final
statement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something
Jetson has requested.  Sykes goes over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	What's this?  What's going on?

			JETSON
	Nothing.

			SYKES
		   (really suspicious
		    now)
	Nothing?

			JETSON
		   (looking away)
	Shouldn't we examine their personal
	effects?

Jetson moves off, leaving Sykes there wondering.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PROPERTY ROOM - COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

Two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents
onto a formica counter.  Sykes looks through the dead
alien's effects while Jetson goes through the human's.
ORTIZ, the college girl working the property counter, sits
nearby doing homework.

Jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown.

			JETSON
	What is this?

			SYKES
		   (looks, then)
	A rubber.  A condom.  You know...
	Coney Island whitefish?
		   (Jetson doesn't know
		    what one is)
	Men, human men, put them on their,
	uh -- penises -- to protect against
	having babies.
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it; Sykes turns
		    to Ortiz)
	You need this for anything?

			ORTIZ
	Nope, got my own.  Anything you guys
	don't use gets stuffed away in
	storage.

Sykes tears open the packet, unrolls the condom, dangles
it before Jetson.

			SYKES
	Get the picture?

			JETSON
		   (frowning)
	And that fits?

			SYKES
	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It
	stretches.

			JETSON
	And still it fits?

Sykes looks at Jetson's serious expression.  He tosses the
condom and packet back into the counter and continues
searching.  A beat, then he can't stop himself -- he
steals a glance at Jetson's crotch.

Still searching, Sykes picks up one of the dead alien's
well-worn heavy work boots.  He grimaces... the sides and
soles are painted with a viscous black substance.  He very
tentatively sniffs it... and is grateful that it's not
what he thought it might be.

			SYKES
	What is this stuff?

Sykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe
it.  Jetson glances over.

			JETSON
	It is a resin.

Sykes looks at him... surprised that he knows.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Newcomers working near methane
	gasses at oil refineries must paint
	it on their boots to protect against
	sparks.

			SYKES
	How the hell do you know that?

			JETSON
	A large number of my people were
	hired by refineries because the
	methane fumes are not harmful to us.
	My spouse's brother is one.

			SYKES
	So the Slag they're cutting into
	upstairs worked at a refinery just
	like Hubley worked at a refinery.
		   (beat)
	I'd say that "possible" connection
	between the two cases just got a
	hell of a lot more possible.
		   (beat)
	Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk
	to the wife of the Slag store owner
	blown away last night.

			JETSON
	I believe I should interview the
	widow alone.

			SYKES
	Why the hell--?!
		   (realizes it's
		    because of his lack
		    of "bedside manner")
	Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  MINI-MART - LATE AFTERNOON

The shattered windows have been covered with plywood.
Through the open doorway we see Jetson talking to the
Proprietor's Wife.  She studies a photo Jetson shows her,
nods her head, speaking rapidly in the alien language.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Sykes drives along beside the mammoth, steaming network of
buildings and pipes that make up the refinery.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Through the loud and smoky refinery we see Sykes walking
with the newly promoted Methane Section manager, O'NEAL,
in tie and shirtsleeves.  The workmen around them are both
human and Newcomer.

			O'NEAL
		   (yelling over the
		    roar)
	Mr. Hubley was an all right guy --
	and a damn good manager.  The men
	liked him.  I'm really gonna have to
	scramble to fill his shoes.

			SYKES
	Well, one of the men didn't like him
	so much...

They stop and Sykes hands O'Neal the polariod photo of
Raincoat alien.  They have stopped near the heavy
refrigeration-type door leading to the "METHANE SECTION".

Newcomer workers move in and out through the door during:

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo)
	You think this is the guy who did
	it?

			SYKES
	We think he could'a been involved,
	yeah.  You know him?

			O'NEAL
	To be honest, it's hard to say.  I
	hate to admit it but -- they all
	still kinda look alike to me.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Who else can I ask around here?

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo
		    again)
	Wait.  You know who it looks like?
	Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James
	Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He
	took the afternoon off.

			SYKES
	I think you're gonna find he's taken
	the rest of his life off.

O'Neal reacts.  Sykes notices the door to the Methane
Section.

			SYKES
	That where Anderson worked?

			O'NEAL
	Yes it is.
		   (some alien workers
		    come through the
		    door)
	Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas
	in there.  I don't know how these
	fellas do it.

Sykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the
door.  O'Neal watches Sykes' expression for signs of
suspicion.

				    CUT TO:

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - SYKES AND O'NEAL

We see Sykes hand O'Neal a card, then move off.  O'Neal
watches him briefly, then crosses to some steps and starts
up this way.
We PAN with him as he enters a door here on the second
level.

INT.  METHANE SECTION CONTROL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

O'Neal enters, moves to a telephone, begins to dial.
Beyond is a glass wall overlooking the Methane Section.

ANGLE - BELOW

CAMERA TRACKS through the Methane Section... past the
alien workers in lab whites... past all the arcane
equipment and chemical procedures... ending in an EXTREME
CLOSE UP of a small cylindrical dispenser as it fills
slowly with a pale blue, viscous liquid.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - JETSON'S STREET - DUSK

We're SHOOTING THROUGH the slug-mobile window as Sykes
pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately
maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown.  Jetson's
WIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn
with a garden hose.  Jetson's son, age six, rides his
bicycle along the walkway.  Jetson, dressed in his suit
for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son.

Sykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes.

			SYKES
	Jesus.  Welcome back Ozzie and
	Harriet...

He HONKS the horn.  Jetson looks up, then moves to his
wife and kisses her goodbye.  Moves to his son, kisses him
on the top of his head.

Sykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his
derisive expression softens.  As corny as this tableau may
be, there's something very appealing about the innocence
of it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes.

Jetson starts to climb into the car, and we--

				    CUT TO:

INT.  RESTROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

CLOSE on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug
dispensers from a tuxedo pocket.  As the hand brings the
dispenser toward the face, we immediately recognize the
exotic silver bracelet worn by Kipling the night before.
It makes that distinctive CLINKING NOISE.  We PAN with the
hand to reveal Kipling's face... sans bandana and
sunglasses now.  He wears a black tuxedo.  He lets a small
dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his
tongue.  He swallows... and reacts as the rush from the
drug hits him.

The door to the men's room bangs open and a MIDDLE AGED
POLITICO enters, obviously drunk.

Kipling quickly pockets the dispenser, moves past the
Politico to the exit...

Sykes drives, heading for the Biltmore Hotel.

			JETSON
	Mrs. Porter is not taking her
	husband's death well.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Did you learn anything?

			JETSON
	A week ago two men came to see her
	husband.  After they left, he was
	very frightened.  She identified one
	of the men from a photo I showed
	her.  It was Hubley.

			SYKES
	Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

			JETSON
	She didn't know him.  But she said
	her son might.

			SYKES
	Did you talk to him?

			JETSON
	He has not been home since that day.
	But she told me where to find him.

Sykes nods.

INT.  MAIN BALLROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

The men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns.  Only
two of three Newcomers faces present.  Kipling threads his
way among the tables as the MAYOR, at the speaker's
platform, addresses the assembly.

			MAYOR
	... Our guest speaker tonight has
	done so much in his community and
	for his community in such a short
	period of time.  And I must say, as
	the founder of the first Newcomer
	owned and operated corporation in
	Southern California, he certainly
	has come quite far in the last few
	years.  Granted, not as far as he
	came in the years before reaching
	Los Angeles.

There is laughter from the VIPs.  Kipling slides into a
seat at one of the front tables.  He leans over and
whispers something into the ear of the person seated to
his right.  We see this CLOSE UP, and don't see who he is
whispering to yet.  Whoever it is, nods.

			MAYOR
		   (continuing)
	As Mayor of this city, it gives me
	great pleasure to introduce someone
	who has so readily made our city
	his home... and all of us who live
	here, his friends.  Ladies and
	gentlemen, William Harcourt.

The VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front
table.  At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to
capture WILLIAM HARCOURT, seated to Kipling's right.
Harcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer
entrepreneur... handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes
that glint with his piercing intellect.  He rises, smiling
warmly, steps past his striking ALIEN DATE seated to his
right, to make his way to the podium.  He shields his eyes
somewhat from the bright spotlight.

Once behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast
pocket as the applause ebbs.

			HARCOURT
	Thank you all for that very warm
	reception.
		   (pauses, smiles)
	I'm particularly grateful because I
	actually had the gall to write that
	in my notes: "Thank you all for that
	very warm reception".  Imagine how
	embarrassed I would've been if it
	hadn't have been such a warm
	reception.

The VIPs laugh.  He's won them over instantly with his
charm and candor.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT

Sykes, followed by a reluctant Jetson, bears down on
Harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his Date, and
Kipling.  We see Kipling recognize Sykes from their fight
two nights before... but because Kipling looks so
different, Sykes doesn't recognize him outright.  Still,
during this, Sykes senses something, though he's not sure
what.

			SYKES
	William Harcourt?

			HARCOURT
	Yes...

			SYKES
	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is
	Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police
	Department.

			HARCOURT
		   (nodding greeting)
	Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't
	aware there were any Newcomers at
	the rank of Detective yet.

			JETSON
	I am the first.

			HARCOURT
	Congratulations.  This is my
	administrative assistant, Rudyard
	Kipling.

			SYKES
		   (throw away)
	Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?
		   (to Harcourt)
	Listen, we just need a minute of
	your time...

			JETSON
	We'd like to ask you about a
	business associate of your, Warren
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	Yes, I heard about poor Warren.
	Tragic.

			SYKES
	You were partners with him on some
	Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate
	thing.

			HARCOURT
	That's right.  He and I, along with
	seven or eight others.  Listen,
	gentlemen, I will be happy to assist
	you in any way I can --
	unfortunately, at the moment, I'm
	overdue at another function.

Suddenly there's a voice from O.S.:

			MAYOR (O.S.)
	William...

Harcourt turns as the Mayor and his WIFE step up.

			HARCOURT
	Mr. Mayor...

			MAYOR
	William, I was wondering if you
	wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and
	me.  Two limousines trying to make
	it across town in all this traffic,
	we're bound to be later than we
	already are.

			HARCOURT
	Excellent idea.  Ray, I wonder if
	you know two of your police
	officers... Detective Jetson and
	Sykes.

			MAYOR
		   (shaking their hands,
		    dismissively)
	A pleasure.
		   (to Harcourt)
	We really should be going.

The wind is knocked from Sykes' sails by the presence of
the Mayor with a very impatient expression.  Harcourt
smiles.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	Please feel free to call my office
	Monday morning for an appointment.
		   (to Jetson)
	Congratulations again on your
	promotion, Detective.  Remember...
	you're out there setting an example
	in our community.  I'll be keeping
	an eye on you.

Harcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are
penetrating... telegraphing a subliminal warning.
Harcourt and entourage move off... leaving Sykes steaming.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - HARCOURT AND KIPLING - NIGHT

Walking behind the others.  They speak in very low voices;
Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs
during:

			KIPLING
	That cop, the human, he was the one
	who killed Anderson and the driver.

			HARCOURT
	This is becoming a serious breach of
	security.

			KIPLING
	He didn't recognize me.

			HARCOURT
	It is his new partner that I'm
	worried about.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  POLICE FIRING RANGE - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

MAFFET, the stocky retired cop behind the counter, hands
Jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets.
Sykes nods to Jetson, motioning him toward the firing
line.

			SYKES
	Go on ahead.  I'll be right in.
		   (to Maffet, low)
	What'd you dig up for me?

Maffet slides open a drawer, takes out a paper bag
containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore.  By
his manner this deal is definitely not kosher.  Sykes
hefts the weapon.

			MAFFET
	You said you wanted the biggest
	thing I could find... Well, this is
	it.

			SYKES
	What is it?

			MAFFET
	Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking
	twice the impact energy of .44
	Magnum hot loads.

			SYKES
		   (flips open cylinder)
	Only holds five.

			MAFFET
	Yeah, the shells are too big for six
	in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you
	don't need but one.

			SYKES
		   (sighting)
	No... two.


EXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - FIRING LINE - NIGHT

Jetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking
careful aim with his .38 as Sykes walks up.  Jetson slips
the protectors down.

			SYKES
	Well, let's see what you got,
	Cochise.  Gimme six, rapid fire.

Jetson, a little nervous at this command performance,
turns, sets, and FIRES at the silhouette target.  It's a
large, sloppy grouping.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	How long you been shooting?  That's
	pitiful.  Whattya gonna do if
	somebody draws down on you, wave
	your scores on the written exam at
	'em?

Sykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the
Casull.

			JETSON
	Why did you do it?

			SYKES
	Why'd I do what?

			JETSON
	Agree to work with me?  You don't
	like me... you don't like any of us.
	You have nothing but contempt for
	us.  And yet you become an outcast
	from your club of detectives by
	making me your partner...

			SYKES
	My partner is dead!  Because one of
	you bastards killed him -- then
	disappeared into a rathole down in
	Slagtown, where he's home and dry,
	'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody
	says nothing...

Sykes grabs a bullet-proof vest from nearby, slaps it onto
the hanging target form.  He hits the switch, running the
target down to the end of the lane.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	But he didn't figure on you, George.
	You're going to get me through that
	wall of silence.  You're going to
	make them talk to me.  You're going
	to help me find that Slag son-of-a-
	bitch.  Comprendo?  And if Fedorchuk
	and the boys in the bullpen don't
	like it, screw them... and if the
	Captain doesn't like it, screw
	him... and if all the Slags down in
	Slagtown don't like it... well screw
	them too!

Sykes raises the Casull, fires.  KA-BOOM!!!  The shell
rockets clean through the bullet-proof vest on the target
form.  The recoil slams Sykes back, jerks his arm up.  KA-
BOOM!!!  again, and another hole is drilled through the
vest.  Other shooters look over.  Sykes sets the gun
down... sees his hand is bleeding.  Jetson absorbs all
this, as we--

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

A violet neon "X" FILLS FRAME, flashing hypnotically.
It's a bar catering to rough-trade Newcomer clientele.
Several ALIEN MEN, brute laborer-types, lounge around out
front.  They glare with antagonism as Sykes and Jetson
climb out of their car.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Okay, just stay back and do what I
	do.  Watch and learn, watch and
	learn...


INT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson walk into the almost total blackness of
this all-Newcomer place.

A few near-infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness.

			SYKES
	I can't see dick in here.

We can dimly make out booths along one wall, some tables,
and the bar.  There are maybe twenty figures seated or
standing in the darkness.  The room falls silent in a wave
as Sykes' presence becomes noticed.

Sykes saunters forward, commanding the space with his
unhurried movements.

			SYKES
		   (calling into the
		    dark silence)
	Which one'a you Slags is Porter?

			VOICE
		   (from the back of
		    the bar)
	Who wants to know?

Sykes squints into the darkness, then--

			SYKES
		   (aside to Jetson)
	Who said that?

			JETSON
		   (tilts his head to
		    indicate)
	At the end of the bar.

Sykes nods, starts in that direction.

			SYKES
	My name is Sykes.  I'm--

			ALIEN VOICE
	Ss'ai k'ss?

The whole place roars with LAUGHTER.  Too late Sykes
remembers what his name sounds like to them.  He continues
down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his
leg out and trips Sykes with his size 16 work boot.  Sykes
stumbles, then recovers and pivots on the offender.  Hoots
and derisive LAUGHTER.  He sees only shadows.

			OFFENDER
		   (merely a voice in
		    the dark)
	Careful, ss'loka', you might hurt
	yourself.

More laughter.  Sykes gives the darkness where the
offender sits a hard stare, then turns and shoulders his
way to the end of the bar.  Jetson follows.  Sykes stops
behind a big Newcomer in greasy work clothes.

ANGLE

The punk Newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head
down, trying to be inconspicuous.

He glances over at the two cops... his expression shifting
to recognition as he spots Jetson.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes speaks to the Big Newcomer's back.

			SYKES
	You Porter?

The Big Newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk.
Doesn't turn.  Sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns
him around.  The alien grabs Sykes' hand off, rising to
his full height.  He and Sykes lock eyes.  Meanwhile.  the
punk Newcomer (PORTER) has started to slip away unnoticed.
Jetson spots him, reaches out with one arm, and grabs him
by the jacket.

			JETSON
	No, Matthew.  I believe this is the
	one you want.

He pulls Porter back into play.  Now Jetson sees Porter's
face... and he, too, reacts with recognition.

Sykes gives Jetson a sour look, releases the Big Newcomer,
and turns his malice on the punk Newcomer.

			SYKES
	Your name wouldn't happen to be
	Porter, would it?

			JETSON
	Uh, Matthew...

			SYKES
		   (over his shoulder
		    to Jetson)
	Back off, George.

			JETSON
	But I-- (know this man).

			SYKES
	I'll handle it.

Jetson backs off, letting him handle it.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	Jesus, are the questions too tough
	for you already?  Let's try again--
		   (slowly)
	Is your name Porter?

			PORTER
	Ss'kya'ta'.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What's that?

			JETSON
	Screw you.

			SYKES
		   (back to Porter)
	Screw me?  That can't be right.

			PORTER
	Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'.  Ss'trokya'
	ss'lato na'!

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes, low)
	You don't want to know.

			SYKES
	Tell me.

			JETSON
	Your mother mates out of season.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	That's very colorful.  But see --
	now I've got a problem.  I don't
	seem to be getting much cooperation
	from you, Porter.  So I guess we're
	gonna have to take this little
	session down to my office, ya
	know?

And instantly Sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on
the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around
him.  Jetson gets a blast of it, too.  The aliens are
momentarily blinded.

Sykes has Porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his
face, as he starts to handcuff him.  But Porter gets a
hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight.
Darkness falls... along with Sykes' expression of
satisfaction.

Porter hurls Sykes back, slamming him into a table.  The
crowd HOOTS and CHEERS.  Sykes finds his way to his feet.

			JETSON
	Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this).

			SYKES
	Stay back!  I'm okay.

He charges Porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club.
The two of them battle, then Sykes sees his opportunity
and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin.
Porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises
again -- smiling.

			PORTER
	Don't they teach you anything about
	us in cop school, little ss'loka'?

Porter grabs Sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver
a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into FRAME, locking
with Porter's, blocking the punch.  It is Jetson.

			JETSON
	Enough.

			PORTER
		   (eyeing Jetson)
	Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.  You're a
	cop.
		   (with some contempt)
	It fits you.

Jetson says something to him in the alien language.
Porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back
exit.  Sykes stumbles over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	You know that guy?

			JETSON
		   (nods)
	From quarantine, when my people
	first arrived here.  He and I were
	housed together.

			SYKES
	How could a straight-arrow like you
	ever pick a roommate like him?

			JETSON
	In the camps, we were lodged four to
	a room.  The selection process was
	entirely random.  We did not get to
	stay with our friends... or
	families...

And he moves toward the back exit.  Sykes watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Porter leans against an alley wall.  He speaks English
learned on the streets.

			JETSON
	You don't know what your father and
	these two men were arguing about?

			PORTER
	I told you -- I was in the back of
	the store.  I just heard voices,
	muffled like.

			SYKES
	One of the two men was Hubley,
	right?  What about the other one?
	Did you know him?

			PORTER
	Yeah... I seen him around.  High-
	roller dude named Strader.  Joshua
	Strader.  Runs a club on the west
	side.  Encounters.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I heard of it.

			PORTER
	That's all I know.  You want
	anything more, you ask somebody
	else.

He pushes away from the wall, heads for the door to the
bar.

			JETSON
	I am sorry about your father.

Porter throws him a look over his shoulder, then
disappears through the door.  Sykes and Jetson start down
the alley.

			JETSON
	If I may make a suggestion... We
	have different weak spots than you
	do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve
	plexus under the arm, here, will
	produce the effect I think you were
	looking for.

			SYKES
	Yeah, sure.  I knew that...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

The wall-mounted menu is in English and the Alien
Language.  The SERVERS are teen aged humans and aliens.

Sykes and Jetson stand at the counter awaiting their
order.

			KID
		   (serving them)
	Six forty-two.

They both put money on the counter.  The kid goes to put
the order together.  Sykes looks at the alien characters
on the menu.

			SYKES
	I don't think I could ever learn to
	read that shit.
		   (beat)
	How long did it take you to learn
	English?

			JETSON
	Three months.
		   (off Sykes' look)
	We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is
	our strength... what we were bred
	for, to adapt to hostile
	environments.

The Serving Kid puts their bags on the counter.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Thank you.

They take the bags and walk off, digging the food out of
the bags as they talk:

			SYKES
	My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer
	girl in his class.  She's six years
	old and in seventh grade already...

They climb into the car.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson doesn't respond... some things are better left
unaddressed.  Meanwhile, Sykes has unwrapped his food and
recoils in disgust.

			SYKES
	Oh, God.  I think I got yours
	here...

He holds up two strips of raw meat with patches of animal
fur still on them.  Jetson meanwhile is grimacing at the
dripping cheeseburger he's just unwrapped.  They quickly
trade.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Which one is that?  Raw what?

			JETSON
		   (eating a strip)
	This is mole.  It's good.

			SYKES
	I'll bet.
		   (winces, watching him
		    chew)
	Would it really put you out if they
	tossed that on the grill for a
	minute or two?

			JETSON
	Our bodies do not assimilate the
	nutrients if the food has been
	cooked.

Jetson looks over at him, smiling.

			SYKES
	Oh, that's real attractive.  You got
	fur in your teeth, George.  Come on,
	man, we're gonna be talking to
	people... jeez.

Sykes looks at his burger, his appetite gone, shoves it
back into the sack and tosses it into the back seat.


INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Sykes pulls onto the street.

			SYKES
	So what was that other word for
	Human... Slow ka?

			JETSON
	Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small
	but intelligent creature".
		   (Sykes looks over,
		    doesn't know if he
		    likes this)
	It loses much in the translation.

			SYKES
	And what was that one about my
	mother?  That was a good one.

			JETSON
	Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.

Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along
haltingly.  After several tries, he can say it passably
well.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

An upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club.  The
antithesis of the "X" bar.  A human HOSTESS in a slit
dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a
table.  She moves off.  The two cops look up at the stage.

REVERSE ANGLE

revealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA.  She
moves with a feline blend of strength and grace.  Framing
her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a
mane as she undulates to the MUSIC.

Sykes watches with fascination.  The MUSIC ends and
Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a
human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up.  Sykes and Jetson
quickly intercept her as she heads backstage.

			JETSON
	You are Cassandra?

			CASSANDRA
	That's right.

			JETSON
	We are with the Police Department.
	This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

			CASSANDRA
		   (laughing)
	Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.

			SYKES
	We're looking for your boss --
	Strader.

She eyes the two of them warily, then moves backstage,
assuming they will follow.


INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

She moves along the narrow corridor.

			CASSANDRA
	He's not here.  Why ask me?

			JETSON
	The young woman at the front said
	you might know where he is.

			CASSANDRA
	She did, did she?  Well, she was
	wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.

			SYKES
	No problem.

She moves through a door.  Sykes follows closely so does
Jetson.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall.

			SYKES
	Look, we're not here doing an
	interview for the school paper.
	This is a homicide investigation...
	and if you don't stop jerkin' us
	around, I'm ready to start playin'
	hardball.

Jetson has waited politely half-in half-out of the room.
Sykes rapidly motions to him to "go look around".  Jetson
mimes back, "Huh?"

			CASSANDRA
		   (slipping out of her
		    dance costume)
	Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds
	interesting.  Are you going to
	strike me?  You could tie me up and
	then do whatever you want with me...
	I've got my own ropes.

			SYKES
		   (still miming to
		    Jetson)
	Does that cost extra or you throw
	them in?

			CASSANDRA
	You've got me all wrong.  I don't
	charge money for something that I
	myself find pleasurable...

Finally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him.  He
says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar:

			JETSON
	I am going out to the car.  I will
	meet you there.

Sykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor.
Cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish,
low-cut dress.

			CASSANDRA
	Look, I don't know where Mr.
	Strader might be.  He comes and he
	goes.

			SYKES
		   (starting to feel a
		    little uncomfortable)
	The girl out front mentioned
	Strader's assistant, somebody named
	Watson.  Maybe he knows.

			CASSANDRA
		   (tensing slightly)
	Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.

She is very close to Sykes now.  She fingers the lapel of
his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
		   (continuing)
	I know... Why don't you hang around
	for a while, let me entertain you?
	It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the
	truth, have you ever... made it...
	with one of us?

			SYKES
	Not unless I got real drunk and
	nobody told me about it later.

			CASSANDRA
	A virgin.  I find that very
	arousing...


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

MUSIC drifts up from downstairs.  Jetson moves along the
corridor, scoping things out.  He tries a door.  Locked.
Tries another one.  Open.  He eases it wider, then enters
the darkened office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the office.  Looks around.  Makes his
way to the cluttered desk top.  Pushes things around...
all the usual stuff.  He starts to turn away, then his eye
catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger
books.  He reaches for it.  A small dispenser -- of the
kind we saw being filled at the refinery.  Jetson studies
it, his suspicions growing.  Opening it, he finds only the
barest trace of a viscous substance.

He smells it... not enough to tell for certain what it is.
But enough that he is very concerned about what it could
be.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now.
She takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her
facial ridges.  She shudders with pleasure.  Sykes begins
to perspire.

			SYKES
	There's lots of things I haven't
	done, but his ain't high on the
	list.  Don't take it personally.

			CASSANDRA
	I think you're just a little scared
	now, about what you might find once
	the lights go out.  A little
	scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe
	more than you want to admit.  But
	doesn't that turn you on, that
	curiosity and fear, swirling
	together?
		   (coos)
	Think of it as broadening your
	horizons.

			SYKES
	I like my horizons narrow.

			CASSANDRA
		   (pressing herself
		    into him)
	Your voice is saying no, but your
	body is saying yes.

He quickly disengages from her.

			SYKES
	My voice, body, and everything else
	is saying I'll be back in two hours
	for Strader, and he better damn well
	be here.

He shoves a business card at her, then retreats through
the door.


INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes closes the door and lets out his breath.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra's expression instantly turns to worry and she
quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom
button.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson, looking through a desk drawer, hears the intercom
BUZZ in the next room.  Through the wall--

			WATSON (O.S.)
		   (tentatively)
	Yes...?

			CASSANDRA (O.S.)
		   (over the intercom,
		    breathless)
	Todd, it's me.  The police were just
	here... looking for Strader.  And
	asking about you.

Jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office,
drawing his gun.  The floor squeaks beneath his feet.  He
looks down, then continues toward the door.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson eases open the door.  It's the manager's private
office.  Jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the
desk, the desk lamp on, a lit cigarette in an ashtray --
but no one behind the desk.  Jetson eases through the door
and--

-- a chair crashes down on him from behind the door!
Jetson goes down, his gun skittering out of his hand.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Jetson and his assailant battle in the well-appointed
office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes hears the fight through the private office door.
He throws the door open.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes stands in the doorway, the Casull straight-armed at
Jetson's assailant.

			SYKES
	Freeze!  Now!

The assailant does.  He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing
hard.  He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit.  This is
TODD WATSON.  Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise.

Suddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking
him sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson
seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into
some furniture and dives for the door.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Watson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape.
Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra.  She's as strong
as he is, but he has the edge in experience.

Jetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway,
ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went.

			SYKES
		   (struggling with
		    Cassandra)
	Fire escape!  End of the hall!

Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges to
get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff
around a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at
him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and
charges down the corridor.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Jetson pounds down the fire escape.  Below him, he sees
Watson reach the ground and take off running for the
parking area.

Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting
down other rows trying to make up the distance between
them.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen
feet to the ground.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires
it up.  Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls
his gun, aims.

The white reverse-lights flash on.  Jetson stands there,
gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.  In that split
second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to
avoid being hit.


INT.  ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT

Watson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes
standing right in front of the car.  He hits the gas.
Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car.
Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass,
panics and--


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars.

Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car.

Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his
arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct
hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.  Watson
folds over with a "ooowwph" sound and drops to his knees.

			SYKES
		   (breathing hard)
	I'll be damned.  It worked.
		   (sees Jetson run up)
	How'd you like that, huh?  Whammo!
	Both barrels.  Dropped him like a
	bag of cement.

Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.  He looks at the
I.D.

			SYKES
	Who is he?

			JETSON
	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.

Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one
agonized breath.

			WATSON
	I don't believe this.  Look at my
	suit.  Look at what you made me do
	to my car.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Your girlfriend put up a better
	fight than you did, pal.

			JETSON
	We are looking for your employer,
	Joshua Strader.

			WATSON
	He's out of town.

			JETSON
	Why did you run?

			WATSON
	Because you two were chasing me.

			SYKES
	We were chasing you because you ran,
	you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

			JETSON
	When will Strader return?

			WATSON
	Who knows.  He's the boss -- he
	doesn't have to check in with me.

			SYKES
		   (wearily)
	Watson... this is my partner here's
	first coupla days, and he wants to
	make a good impression.  Me, though,
	the way I feel -- this could be my
	last day, know what I mean?  And I'm
	ready to rain on you like a cow
	pissin' on a flat rock.

			WATSON
	Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been
	around for a coupla days.  He didn't
	tell me where he was going or when
	he'd be back.  I swear it.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What do you think?

			JETSON
	I believe he is probably lying.

			SYKES
	Through his ass.
		   (to Watson)
	Next time you see him, tell him to
	call me... unless you want us to
	keep coming back on you like a bad
	case of herpes.

Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket.
They walk away and Watson slumps against his car.

ANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON

as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	George, you can handle the women
	from now on, you mind?

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he
hears footsteps.  He turns with a "What now?" expression
and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.  He
goes down.  Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN
THUGS.  One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's
employ.

			QUINT
		   (to other Thugs)
	Okay, scrape him up.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT

Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access
road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs.
The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d.
van.

Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back
of the van.  Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three
human Thugs.

They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing
the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron.
He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.

			HARCOURT
	Any progress?

			QUINT
	My arm's gettin' tired and so far,
	zip.

			KIPLING
	He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to
	Strader.

			QUINT
	What's that mean?

			KIPLING
	Duty-bonded.  His allegiance to
	Strader is above pain or life.

			QUINT
	You tellin' me this guy would die
	before he'd screw his boss and work
	for us?  Nobody's that dumb.

			KIPLING
	It is something you couldn't
	comprehend, Quint.

Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to
keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.

			HARCOURT
	I understand you have been resisting
	my offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of
	duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --
	no longer an issue, I'm afraid...

Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from
the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot
twice through the front of his silk suit.  Watson's eyes
widen in fear.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	I will not make this offer again.  I
	want you to work for me, to manage
	the nightclub as Strader's successor.
	If you do, you will know a wealth
	and comfort our people never dared
	imagine...

Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant.

			WATSON
	Sss'k'a ta'!

Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring
his resolve.  Then--

			HARCOURT
	It is such a pity to die for an
	outmoded value.
		   (rising)
	Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for
	our friend's swimming lesson.

Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.

			HARCOURT
		   (to Watson)
	It's important to learn new skills.
	Essential to your growth as a
	person.

Quint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper.  He bucks
and lunges as they drag him toward the surf.  Quint
addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy.

			QUINT
	You never seen this before, have
	you, Billy?  oh, man, you ain't
	gonna believe it... seawater is like
	battery acid to these guys... I
	don't know what it is, some kinds
	chemical reaction.  Whatta you think
	it is, Watson?  Whoa, hold him.
		   (a wave breaks
		    outside, the foam
		    rolls in)
	What I love about the surf is you
	can never tell how far up it's going
	to come until it... whoops, got a
	little wet there.

The wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs.  He
screams.  Flailing, one of his hands dips below the
surface of the water.  He howls and yanks out his hand.
We see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand
droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the
hand.  The Thugs get Watson swinging.

			QUINT
	Last call, sucker.  One... two...
	THREE!

Watson is flung into the surf.

ANGLE

Harcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the
waterline.  We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then
nothing.  Kipling is very nervous this close to the water.
Harcourt seems unperturbed.

			KIPLING
	When we picked him up, he was
	talking to those two cops -- the two
	who came to question you about
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	This is getting out of hand.  I want
	you to deal with it.  Immediately.

A wave rushes up the sand.  Kipling quickly steps back.
Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops
six inches from his dress shoes.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	We must learn to embrace the things
	we fear... and from that grow
	strong.

A moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo.
He motions to Strader's body and the surf.  The Thugs grab
the body and heave it into the waves.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the
kitchen wall phone.  Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle
of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a
glass, pours himself a shot.  As Jetson is talking, he
spots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out
of the refrigerator two nights ago.

He sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement.
He finishes with his wife and hangs up.  He watches Sykes
take a long pull on the vodka.

			JETSON
		   (holds up milk
		    carton)
	Would you mind?

Sykes shrugs, tosses him a glass.  Jetson pours the semi-
lumpy milk and takes a big swallow.  Sykes grimaces.
Then--

			SYKES
		   (indicates phone)
	So, she keeps you on a pretty short
	leash, does she?

			JETSON
	My wife?  She worries about me.

Sykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his
voice more weary then bitter.

			SYKES
	Yeah... I know the routine.

			JETSON
	You are married?

			SYKES
	Was.  Divorced.

			JETSON
	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a
	strange concept to us.

			SYKES
	It's like having an eleventh finger
	removed.  It hurts like hell, but
	you never really needed the damn
	thing in the first place.

Jetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand
this.  They drink... Jetson gazes around.

			JETSON
	Your home is quite disordered.  I
	thought perhaps you had been
	burglarized when I walked in.

			SYKES
		   (growling)
	I appreciate your honesty, George.

He smacks his glass against Jetson's.  They drink.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

Sykes has his wallet out... showing Jetson a dog-eared
photo.

			SYKES
	Ignore the bitch on the left, that's
	Edie.  I call her Edi Amin... This
	is Kristin, my daughter.  It's kinda
	an old picture... she's twenty now.
	Getting married, in fact... on
	Sunday.

Jetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the
proffered photo.  They're both a little drunk now.

			JETSON
	Human children can be very
	beautiful.
		   (then)
	Getting married?  Congratulations.
	You will be taking Sunday off,
	then...

			SYKES
		   (uneasy)
	Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not
	sure I'm gonna go.
		   (mumbles)
	She doesn't need her burn-out of a
	father there...

Jetson looks at him.  Sees something he never thought
possible in Sykes.  Vulnerability.  Trying to break the
melancholy mood, Jetson reaches for his wallet.

			JETSON
		   (upbeat)
	I must show you...
		   (flips open wallet,
		    shows four crisp
		    photos of his wife)
	And this is Richard.  My son.  He's
	four years old.  We named him after
	the former President, Richard Nixon.

Sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table...
and has to laugh.  He looks up at Jetson's sincere face.
He may be starting to like this guy.

			SYKES
	You open to a piece of advice?  Tell
	people you named him after Richard
	Burton, the actor.  Just take my
	word for it.

And he clacks his glass against Jetson's sitting on the
table, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

They are quite a bit drunker.  Jetson has doffed his
jacket and tie, leans in, listening intently to Sykes.

			SYKES
	... and so, and so the doctor says,
	"If this is the thermometer, then
	where'd I leave the pen?"
		   (laughs raucously,
		    Jetson doesn't
		    react)
	You're not... you don't think that's
	funny?  George, work with me, I
	always get a laugh with that one.
	Look, if the doctor's got the
	thermometer in his hand, then
	where's his pen gotta be?

			JETSON
		   (straight-faced)
	In the other man's rectum.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Sticking out of his ass... yeah!
	See, that's what makes it a joke.
	There's like a surprise, and your
	mind fills in the funny picture.
	Here's this guy with a pen stuck in
	his ass and he thinks it's a
	thermometer.
		   (Jetson just blinks)
	Nada, huh?

Jetson shrugs apologetically.  Sykes pours them each
another round.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Your health...

			JETSON
	Ta ss'trakyona'...

They CLACK glasses, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER STILL

The party has moves into the living room floor, around the
coffee table.  It's a quieter moment.

			JETSON
	There is so much our two peoples
	don't understand about each other.

			SYKES
	No shit, Holmes.  You're only from
	another goddamn planet, for
	chrissakes.

			JETSON
	You humans are very curious to us.
	You invite us to live among you, in
	an atmosphere of equality we've
	never known before.  You lay before
	us a beautiful green world, full of
	freedoms and opportunities... You
	give us ownership of our lives for
	the first time... and you ask no
	more of us than you do of
	yourselves: to live by the rules...
	rules that aren't made to keep one
	people subordinate to another, but
	rules that exist to preserve
	equality.  You aspire to very high
	ideals here.

Sykes is watching Jetson, mesmerized.  The guy's never
said this much at one time before.

If he wasn't drunk, Jetson would never let himself open up
to a human like this.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	I hope you can understand how
	special your world is... how unique
	a people you humans are.  So it us
	all the more painful and confusing
	to us that so few of you seem
	capable of living up the the ideals
	you set for yourselves.

			SYKES
	Don't count on me, George.  I never
	had any ideals.

Jetson smiles a little.  He knows that's bullshit.

			JETSON
	We don't understand the hatred, the
	contempt.  But we must bear it... we
	must not react in anger... because
	our situation here is still fragile.
	The separationists would see us
	returned to the quarantine camps.
	The fundamentalists say we have no
	more human rights than dogs or cats.
	But the prejudice we face here is so
	insignificant compared to the pain
	that we've known before.  And that
	is why we are so grateful.

Sykes studies him a long time through heavy-lidded eyes.
Finally--

			SYKES
	Yeah, well... except I did hear you
	eat your dead.

Jetson looks at him a long beat, then--

			JETSON
		   (deadpan)
	Only on Fridays.

Sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then
explodes with laughter.

			SYKES
	You son-of-a-bitch.  You're okay.

Jetson stands unsteadily, and announces:

			JETSON
	I'm going home.

			SYKES
	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You
	do sleep, don't you?

Jetson, going out the front door, just waves over his
shoulder without turning around.  He's gone.

			SYKES
	What a wildman...

Sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward
onto the sofa, unconscious.  And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN

The first hues of dawn stream through the window.  Sykes
remains passed out on the sofa where we left him.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

The slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the
RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this
street at the corner.

The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug-
mobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights
carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint.

Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then
slides behind the wheel.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN

Quint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a
packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and
two lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down,
starts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears
from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the
seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back
seat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He
sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy.

Under the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works.
Mistake.

Jetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees
this guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his
brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the
face with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his
face.  That was the last thing he needed.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car.
He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck.

It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as
Jetson stumbles out of the car.  He whips out his gun from
the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand.
Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien
phrase, clearly the equivalent of "Fuck it...".

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY

Sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left
him.  Someone is POUNDING on the door.  He regains
consciousness reluctantly.

			SYKES
	This better be good news or money.

He shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting
Jetson.  Jetson holds the C-4 charge in a handkerchief
with one hand and gives it to Sykes.

			JETSON
	Hold this.
		   (lurching to the
		    sink)
	I feel very terrible.

Sykes registers what he's holding.  He moves to Jetson,
who is running his head under the tap.

			SYKES
	Where'd you get this?!!

			JETSON
	A man, a human, was wiring it to
	your car.  I didn't get a good look
	at him.
		   (then, registering
		    that it's day;
		    panicked)
	I must call my wife...

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PRECINCT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

Jetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing
rumpled and a day old.  Sykes has showered and changed so
he's not suffering as much by comparison.  They approach
Sykes' desk.

			JETSON
	She's going to divorce me.

			SYKES
	George, she's not gonna divorce you.
	You mate for life, remember?

			JETSON
	She's very progressive.  I'm certain
	she's considering it.

ANGLE - A UNIFORMED SECRETARY

distributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes.

			SECRETARY
	You guys are looking for somebody
	named Strader, right?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			SECRETARY
	Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned
	in.  They found him.
		   (Sykes and Jetson
		    react)
	Or at least what's left of him,
	washed up on the beach at Zuma.

Sykes and Jetson react again.

			SECRETARY
		   (continuing; handing
		    over  the message
		    slip)
	They're still there if you wanna
	catch them.

She moves off.

			SYKES
	Well, let's roll, George.

			JETSON
		   (with a stricken
		    expression)
	To the... to the beach?

			SYKES
	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - ZUMA BEACH - DUSK

CRANE SHOT, nice and WIDE, showing the slug-mobile turning
off P.C.H. onto a gravel road which curves down the the
beach.  The following is V.O. as the car approaches the
water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Why?

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Please, I must get out here.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Come on, you won't have to get near
	the water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car!

We see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

			SYKES
	All right, okay.  Keep your
	pantyhose on.  Jeez, when in doubt,
	freak out, for chrissake.

Sykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen
of sweat, his hands shaking.  Sykes softens.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	It's all right, George.  It's cool.
	Just wait here, all right?  I'll be
	back in a coupla minutes.

			JETSON
	Thank you.

He climbs out and Sykes drives down to the beach... toward
a cluster of vehicles: a Sheriff's black-and-white, a
coroner's wagon, and Fedorchuk's unmarked sedan.


EXT.  BEACH - DUSK

A quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a
person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk
suit.  Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and
other high tide detritus.

ANGLE ON SYKES, FEDORCHUK, AND ALTEREZ

looking down at the body.  A CORONER'S TECHNICIAN is doing
a closer inspection.

			FEDORCHUK
	Found his wallet in his jacket
	pocket.  Joshua Strader, big as
	life.

			CORONER'S TECH
	Jesus, what a mess.  It's gonna be a
	bear to make a positive
	determination, but it looks to me
	like he was shot before being tossed
	in the drink.  At least twice--
		   (indicates where
		    hearts  would've
		    been on the body)
	-- here, and here.

Sykes absorbs this.  He rises along with Fedorchuk and
Alterez.

			SYKES
	How're you two doing on Tuggle's
	killer?

			ALTEREZ
	The store owner's son is in a street
	gang, so now we're thinking maybe
	it's gang related.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's real good.  You guys
	follow up on that for a coupla
	months.

Fedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above.

			FEDORCHUK
	Look at your dildo partner.  He's
	too scared to even come down to the
	sand.
		   (calls up to Jetson,
		    even though he's too
		    far away to hear)
	You're not gonna get wet standing
	here, moron!

			SYKES
	I'd like to see you next to a sea of
	hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see
	how much surfin' you'd do.

Alterez shoots a polaroid of the body.  Sykes grabs it as
it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car.
Fedorchuk flips him the bird.  As Sykes rounds the car, he
sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid
chalk marker a big star with "E.T. P.D." printed inside
it.  Sykes looks around.  Fedorchuk and the others stand
together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his
direction.

			SYKES
	Cute.


EXT.  BEACH ROAD - DUSK

Sykes has stopped to pick Jetson up.

He's wiping the "E.T. P.D."  from the door as Jetson
approaches from the edge of the bluff.  Fedorchuk pulls up
alongside in his n.d. sedan.  He calls off to Jetson, who
is still twenty yards away.

			FEDORCHUK
	Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.
	Forget you hip waders, big guy?

			SYKES
	Lay off, asshole.

			FEDORCHUK
	I may be an asshole, but at least
	I'm a real detective, not some outer
	shit space thing.

Sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be
highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans
against it.

			SYKES
	Yeah?  you're a real honest-to-god
	detective...?

Sykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into
the steering wheel, BAM-HONK!, and in doing so, has hurt
his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with).

He shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing
Fedorchuk's car keys with the other.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Then detect these!

Fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car
keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff.  Jetson, just
climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this
scene without knowing how it began.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

Sykes gets in, slams the door.  His hand hurts as he grabs
the wheel.  He holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the
car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward P.C.H.
Jetson looks over, curious.

			JETSON
	What was that about?

			SYKES
		   (embarrassed that he
		    defended Jetson)
	Nothing.

On Jetson's confused expression, we--

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

A different burger stand.  Sykes and Jetson sit across
from each other at one of the outdoor tables... Sykes with
his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips.  This time
they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they
talk.

			SYKES
	... So we've got three guys dead.
	All Newcomers, all killed the same
	way -- execution style.

			JETSON
	Warren Hubley was in middle
	management at a refinery... Joshua
	Strader operated a successful bar
	and nightclub...

			SYKES
	... and Porter ran a piece of shit
	mom-and-pop mini-mart.
		   (beat)
	So what the hell's the connection?

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PATHOLOGY LAB OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson enter the cluttered lab office.  Winter
is here eating take-out chicken at his cluttered desk.

			SYKES
	You guys finished the postmortem on
	Strader yet?

			WINTER
		   (his mouth full)
	You mean the Blob?  They're
	finishing up now.

			JETSON
	Is Bentner here?  I must speak with
	him.

			WINTER
	He went home early -- his kid was
	sick.

Jetson frowns.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Yeah, but he left something for you.

He wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an
envelope on the desk and hands it to Jetson.  Jetson tears
open the sealed envelope.  The message inside is written
in the alien language.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Does this have something to do with
	the test he ran that he wouldn't
	tell me about?

CLOSE ON - JETSON

His expression grows stricken as he reads the message.

BACK TO SCENE

			SYKES
		   (getting very curious
		    and suspicious now)
	What kind of test?

			WINTER
	Looking for some foreign compound in
	the blood of that alien you dropped
	the other day.

			SYKES
	Did he find anything?

Winter shrugs, indicates the message Jetson reads, as if
to say, "Maybe it says in there".

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Well?

Jetson refolds the paper and puts it in his pocket.

He is clearly disturbed by what he has read.  He looks at
Sykes a moment, then quickly breaks eye contact.

			JETSON
	It is nothing.

Jetson quickly moves off.  Sykes hurries off after him.


INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sykes hurries to catch up with the fast walking Jetson.
They eventually reach the elevators and Jetson jabs the
button during:

			SYKES
	What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't
	nothing yesterday when you asked
	Bentner to run that test and he
	looked like he was about to shit
	peach pits, and it's not nothing
	now.  Don't lie to me, George,
	you're bad at it.

			JETSON
		   (distant, closed)
	You must leave me alone on this.

The elevator arrives, he steps in.  Sykes follows.


INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT

They enter the empty elevator.  Jetson presses the button
to descend.

			SYKES
	No, see, I don't leave you alone...
	I'm your partner.  I don't work that
	way... Tug didn't work that way.

Jetson remains steadfast.  Sykes, about to explode, slams
his palm against the red Emergency Stop button and the
elevator lurches to a halt between floors.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	No secrets, goddammit!  You don't
	hold back from me.  Whatever is
	going on, you're gonna tell me now!

			JETSON
		   (agonizing)
	No.  I cannot involve you.  This is
	not your concern.

			SYKES
	The hell it isn't, when somebody
	wires up enough C-4 explosive to my
	car to turn me into pink mist!
		   (beat)
	That Slag was on something, and not
	sour milk, either?  Am I right?
		   (he has backed Jetson
		    to the wall by sheer
		    force of will)
	TELL ME!  What is it?

			JETSON
		   (finally)
	... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us
	it is a potent narcotic.

			SYKES
	How potent?

			JETSON
	Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The
	"high" lasts several hours.  We
	would receive small amounts of it...
	as a reward for our labor.

			SYKES
	We?  You've taken it?

			JETSON
	We all did.

			SYKES
	Where did he get it?  Was there any
	of it on the ship?

			JETSON
	No... I am sure not.  That is why I
	am so concerned... someone must now
	be producing it here.
		   (emphatically)
	But none of my people know how to
	make it.  The process was carefully
	guarded.

			SYKES
		   (as the enormity
		    sinks in)
	Jesus, this is major.
		   (then)
	Why didn't you tell me sooner?
	Why'd you hold out on me?

			JETSON
	Your people don't know about this
	part of out past.  And they can't
	know -- It would threaten our entire
	existence here.

The voltage runs out of Sykes.  He seems to understand
Jetson's dilemma.

			SYKES
	George... look me in the eye...
	George, you don't ever lie to me
	again.

			JETSON
	I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot
	stop this without you.

Sykes stare at Jetson... absorbing the enormity of the
earth-shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move quickly to the slug-mobile.  Sykes
reaches for the driver's door handle with his punching
hand.  He winces in pain... the son-of-a-bitch still
hurts.  He looks across at Jetson opening the passenger
door.

			SYKES
	George?  How about you drive...

Jetson looks over at him... gently reacting to this vote
of confidence.  They walk quickly around to the opposite
doors, climb in.


INT.  CORRIDOR - BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move down this government-building
corridor.

			SYKES
	There's gotta be some other
	connection.

They enter a door marked BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS.


INT.  BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

HIGH SHOT showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling
this huge room.  It's all but deserted.  Sykes and Jetson
are off to one side with a heavyset woman (human) COMPUTER
OPERATOR, who they're shanghaied into helping them after
hours.

CLOSER - AT COMPUTER OPERATOR'S DESK

She sits at her computer terminal.  Sykes and Jetson stand
behind her as she types in commands and information.

She types: Hubley, Warren.  The computer screen flashes
past various information, then settles on a screen full of
information of HUBLEY, WARREN.

			OPERATOR
	Here's Hubley.
		   (scanning it)
	Left Quarantine on November
	thirtieth, relocated first to
	Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles
	early in February the following
	year.  Field of expertise: chemical
	manufacturing.  Looks like he passed
	up several other better paying jobs
	waiting for that one at the
	refinery.

			SYKES
	Try Joshua Strader, will ya,
	darlin'?

			OPERATOR
	For you, anything.

The Operator punches up STRADER, JOSHUA.  The screen fills
with information.

			OPERATOR
		   (continuing, reading
		    from screen)
	Released on November twenty-ninth.
	Came immediately to L.A.  Ten weeks
	after arriving he took over the
	abandoned club which is now
	Encounters.

			JETSON
		   (to Operator)
	Now the store owner, please.  Cecil
	Porter.

She types it in.

			OPERATOR
	Released December one.  He and his
	wife moved first to Modesto, then
	Coalinga, California -- wherever
	that is -- settled in L.A. in
	April.  Field of expertise:
	organic chemical engineering.  He
	and his wife have one child, a son.

			SYKES
	Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful
	boy... close personal friend of
	George's here.

			OPERATOR
	I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems
	to be matching up...

But Sykes wasn't listening.  He's starting off... an idea
forming.  He stands there a moment, considering it, his
face looking like he's chewing something sour.  It's so
off-the-wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it.
Then--

			SYKES
	Holy shit...
		   (to Jetson)
	Look what we're staring at: three
	Newcomers with nothing in common,
	right?  What if it's just one other
	guy who killed these three?
		   (Jetson looks at him
		    blankly)
	Three and one make four.  Four
	Newcomers... of totally different
	backgrounds...
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it)
	You and the store owner's son --
	that punker!

Suddenly the realization hits Jetson, too.  He looks at
Sykes.

			JETSON
	... Quarantine.

Sykes spins to the Operator, excited.

			SYKES
	Can you dig up their Quarantine
	records in this thing?

			OPERATOR
	Sure.  Just a minute.

She moves up a screen to the top of Porter's information. 

			OPERATOR
		   (to herself)
	Porter was in Lodge seven seven two.

She rapidly types in additional information.  The screen
shifts as she jumps files.  Finally she gets a line that
reads: ENTER LODGE NUMBER: She types: 7-7-2.

Sykes and Jetson lean in as the screen goes blank... then
information flashes past as the computer searches... then,
finally: Occupants, Quarantine Lodge 772: HUBLEY,
WARREN......... STRADER, JOSHUA.........

Sykes and Jetson react -- their hunch is coming true.

On the computer screen: .........PORTER, CECIL.........

Sykes and Jetson, their faces bathed in the green kick of
the screen, stare without blinking, waiting for that forth
name.

On the computer screen: .........HARCOURT, WILLIAM.

CLOSE ON - SYKES AND JETSON

reacting to the name.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

CLOSE on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure
rises from the back seat.  We TILT UP to reveal William
Harcourt.

We MOVE with him as he walks to the n.d. van (from the
beach scene) parked in front of the limousine.  Kipling is
just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab.  Quint
exits the driver door.  Kipling slides open the van's side
panel, reaches in for--

-- a large black suitcase.  He slides it out.  Harcourt
nods.  He and Kipling start into the club, followed by
Quint.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

The club is deserted tonight as Harcourt and entourage
move toward the back.


EXT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second
floor.  Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top
of the stairs waiting for them.  She's very uncomfortable
dealing with Harcourt.  Kipling and Quint continue on
toward the office door.  Harcourt pauses with Cassandra.
He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers
linger against her flesh.

			HARCOURT
	Quite lovely...
		   (best)
	What is your name again?

			CASSANDRA
		   (flinching
		    involuntarily at
		    his touch)
	Cassandra.

			HARCOURT
		   (a chilling smile)
	I will have to remember that...

He continues down toward the office door.  Cassandra
watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - MOVING - NIGHT

			JETSON
	They had months in quarantine to
	develop the plan.  Porter, with his
	chemistry background, must have
	somehow come up with the formula for
	the drug.  Hubley manufactured it --
	at the refinery.  Strader, through
	the nightclub, established a
	distribution network.  And
	Harcourt--

			SYKES
	Harcourt was the brain who brought
	it all together.


EXT.  REFINERY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT


EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

The slug-mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock
entrance.  Sykes and Jetson climb out.  They hop up onto
the loading platform and move purposefully into the well-
lit interior through the open door.


INT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

It is Saturday night, the plant is barely operational --
only a few WORKERS around.  Sykes and Jetson move
purposefully toward the back.

			SYKES
	Okay, George -- we gotta play this
	real smart.

			JETSON
	If the drug is here, we must destroy
	it.

			SYKES
	No, George -- you're missing the
	point.  The drug is evidence.  We
	need to have the evidence, ya know?

Jetson doesn't reply -- he's focused beyond what Sykes is
saying.  Sykes spots O'Neal up ahead by the refrigeration
door to the METHANE SECTION.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	That's the guy...

O'Neal recognizes Sykes and doesn't wait around for the
big Newcomer bearing down on him.  He dodges quickly
through the refrigeration door and swings it closed.
Jetson's hand hits the door an instant later, before it is
latched, and he pushes it open despite O'Neal's body
weight against the other side.


INT.  METHANE ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson grabs O'Neal by the collar and drags him deeper
into the deserted room.

			O'NEAL
	Hey, what are you, crazy?!  You
	can't come in here like this!  Hey!

Sykes reaches the doorway, stops and stares.

			SYKES
	So much for playing it smart...

O'Neal's feet are barely touching the ground as Jetson
moves along the row of drug-manufacturing equipment.

Finally he reaches a stainless steel tub... he runs a long
finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the
drug.  It glistens blue on his finger.  It holds him
mesmerized for several moments... his expression that of a
former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so.

			SYKES
		   (tentatively
		    stepping closer)
	Is that it...?

A beat, than Jetson explodes -- he sweeps a rack of
equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from
his hand onto O'Neal's shirt-front as he slams and pins
the bug-eyed O'Neal to the wall.

			SYKES
	Uh, George...

			JETSON
		   (in O'Neal's face)
	Where is the drug?  Where have they
	taken it?

			O'NEAL
		   (choking)
	What drug?  This is an oil refinery,
	you...

			JETSON
		   (pushing harder)
	WHERE?!

			O'NEAL
		   (unable to breathe)
	You... can't do... this!

			SYKES
	George, uh... you're gonna break his
	little chest bones...

			JETSON
	Stay out of this, Matthew.
		   (to O'Neal)
	Tell me where the drug has been
	taken or I will crush your lungs
	against this wall.

O'Neal is experiencing real fear now.  Sykes has decided
to back Jetson up, for better or worse.  He takes the
"good cop" role.

			SYKES
	Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he
	gets like this, I can't control him.
	I've seen this before.  He got like
	this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's
	spine out and show it to him.
	Nothing I could do.  I hadda go
	throw up.

			O'NEAL
		   (at length, with
		    great effort)
	... They took the stuff out, all of
	it -- this afternoon.

			JETSON
	How much?

			O'NEAL
	About fifty kilos... of
	concentrate... and some street
	grade... in tubes.

Jetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure.
O'Neal is really in bad trouble now.  Even Sykes takes a
half-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush
this man.

			JETSON
	Where have they taken it?

			O'NEAL
	Encount... Encounters Club.

Finally, Jetson eases off.  O'Neal slumps to the floor,
gasping for air.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

This time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set
and hard... as he strides to the car.  Sykes practically
has to run to keep up.

			SYKES
	George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's
	a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it
	-- we got him by the short hairs.
	He ain't gonna make any more of the
	shit.

			JETSON
	The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to
	find it.  I can't let it get out on
	the street.

			SYKES
	Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?

Jetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile,
yanks it open.

			SYKES
		   (continuing; as
		    Jetson starts the
		    car
	You destroy that drug, you destroy
	the case.  Don't blow the whole
	thing now by not following
	procedure.

			JETSON
		   (through the open
		    driver's window)
	Fuck procedure.

And to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels
out.

			SYKES
	Hey!!

Jetson accelerates toward the security gate.  The guard in
the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile
bashes through the barricade bar.

			SYKES
	GEORGE!  GODDAMMIT!!

Sykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no
car.  A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off
his shift starts ambling past.  Sykes runs in front of it,
waving his badge.  The pickup skids to a stop.

			SYKES
	Police.  Get out.  I need this
	thing.  Out, now!

The poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into
gear.  The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have
much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other
traffic.  He takes a hand off the wheel, reaches over and
pops open the glovebox.  He shoves some maps and garbage
aside, reaches deeper inside for something -- we don't see
what.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Cassandra walks a trio of well-dressed DRUG DEALERS (two
alien, one human) through the deserted club.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

She leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets
them enter ahead of her.  A couple of them smile at her
lasciviously as they brush past.  She is about to enter
herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering
her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door.

It is Jetson.  He had been hiding behind some crates
stacked here in the corridor.  He pins Cassandra
powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth.
She struggles until she sees who it is.

			JETSON
	I am here to take Harcourt.  Where
	is he?

She hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a
nod toward the office door.

			CASSANDRA
	In there.

			JETSON
		   (pulling his gun)
	Show me.


INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

The large suitcase rests on the expansive conference
table.  A manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens
it.  Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the
viscous blue drug.  Also several of the small, individual
dispensers.  It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in
a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase.  He is
flanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room.
The room is lit by track light, creating pools of light
and dark.

The two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the
drug.  The human dealer doesn't know what it is.

			HARCOURT
		   (to alien dealers)
	It's been a long time, hasn't it,
	gentlemen?

			HUMAN DEALER
	What is it?

			HARCOURT
	A sweet indulgence from out past...
	resurrected for our future.

Harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien
Dealers' faces... smiles knowingly.  He slides one of the
dispensers from the suitcase.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing; to
		    alien  dealers)
	Please feel free to sample the
	quality.  The experience will be
	everything you remember it to be...

One of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to
his tongue.  The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt--

			ALIEN DEALER
	Where'd you get it?

			HARCOURT
	I arranged to spend some time with
	three very resourceful men.  With a
	certain amount of coaxing, one of
	them was able to reconstitute the
	formula for me.
		   (beat)
	They worked very well together.
	Unfortunately, they are no longer
	with us... but I was fortunate
	enough to reap the benefit of their
	endeavor.

He indicates the drug.  The first alien Dealer sways
gently, enjoying the sensation.  The second alien Dealer
takes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over
him.  The human Dealer is no fool... he grabs the
dispenser.

			HUMAN DEALER
	Let me try some.
		   (he does,
		    immediately spits
		    it out)
	Jesus!  Tastes like detergent!

			HARCOURT
	And that's all the effect it will
	have on you.  But when my fellow
	Newcomers learn they can obtain it
	here, they will work very hard... to
	make as much money as they can... to
	give it to me.

Suddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to
the other office:

			VOICE
	You haven't told him all of it.

Harcourt and the others react.  Quint leaps to his feet,
caught off guard.  Kipling reaches for his shoulder
holster.  A silhouette beside the open door to the outer
office nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then
steps out himself.  It is Jetson.

Quint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes
go wide at the sight of something Jetson holds.

It is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring
to the slug-mobile.  The wires are connected and Jetson's
finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch.

			QUINT
	He's got the C-4 charge!

Jetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of
him.  He is sweating rivers.  The others quickly join him.
He nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he
can see her.

			QUINT
		   (continuing)
	Just take it real casual, buddy.
	Keep your finger on that button and
	don't do nothing squirrely.

			HARCOURT
	If you release that button, you not
	only kill us, but yourself.

			JETSON
	To get you and that--
		   (indicates drug in
		    suitcase)
	-- I would do it.

He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that
Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.

			JETSON
	Everyone up against that wall.
	Very slowly.
		   (to Harcourt)
	Except you.

Harcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where
she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall.
Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen.

Jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosses
it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it.
All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.

			HARCOURT
	One small matter seems to have
	escaped your attention.  That--
		   (indicates suitcase)
	-- is not on any books as a
	controlled substance.  Legally it
	might as well be fifty kilos of...
	grape jelly.

			JETSON
	The charge is murder... and
	conspiracy to commit murder.
	Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably
	others.

There's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue
eyes.

Cassandra stares at Harcourt.

			CASSANDRA
	You... you killed Strader?

Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
	Where's Todd?!  Did you do something
	to Todd?!

Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.

			HARCOURT
	Todd?  Who is Todd.
		   (then remembers;
		    smiles)
	Ah, poor Mr. Watson.

Cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said
sinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They
start out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357
and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's
face.

			JETSON
	NOOO!

Jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He
manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet
going into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a
mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead
wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart.
Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch...
and nothing happens.

			KIPLING
	I got it!

Kipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the
floor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her
with it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously
hits her again.

Meanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling
rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm
-- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over
forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into
Jetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into
the wall face-first, pinning him there.

			HARCOURT
	Kill them both.

			KIPLING
	Here?

			HARCOURT
		   (raging)
	Do it!

Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the
base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger.
There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks
up.

Quint is blown backward away from her.

Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the
Casull smoking in his hand.

Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid
wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He
crashes through it.

ANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR

as the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint
cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds.

ANGLE - IN THE OFFICE

Kipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at
Sykes.

Sykes dodges into the private office for cover.

The three Dealers dive behind any available furniture.

Harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door
leading into the adjoining outer office.

Sykes swings around the edge of the private office door,
straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires.
Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door,
covering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down.

An unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and
Kipling escaping, and takes off after them.

Sykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees
Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He
moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in
surrender, rise from behind the furniture.

			ALIEN DEALER
	Don't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --
	look!

Sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra.

			SYKES
	You okay?

			CASSANDRA
		   (dazed, but all
		    right)
	Yeah...

And he charges out the adjoining office door.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.  Jetson
is ten feet above them.  Sykes flies out onto the fire
escape, a few steps behind Jetson.  A POLICE CAR SIREN is
HEARD arriving O.S.


EXT.  ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT

Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into
the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running.

Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the
fire escape, find themselves near the unit.

			HARCOURT
	Here!

He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps
in.  Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear
and floors it.

Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels
out.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing
car.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the
rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.

			JETSON
	This way!

He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to
it, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls
out.

A second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,
heading straight for the slug-mobile.  Sykes has to grate
between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get
past.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come
thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic.
The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them.

INSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE

Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches...
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and
SIREN blast on.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing
the howling police car through traffic.

Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it
out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy.

			JETSON
	Slow traffic on your right... you're
	clear at the left rear...
		   (Sykes changes lanes)
	Careful, red light ahead...

With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the
cross-traffic without incident.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response
to the approaching lights and SIREN.  Kipling dodges
around the stopped traffic easily.

The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car
now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the
slug-mobile.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same
juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley.

			JETSON
	Yellow light ahead turning red...

But Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it.

			JETSON
		   (continuing; wide-
		    eyed)
	Red light!  Red light!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the
intersection, and continues the chase.  On the wrong side
of the road, head-on into traffic.

Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along
the wrong side.  They eventually catch up to the police
unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between
them.

Sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull
with the other.  He brings it up and around right in front
of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window
at Kipling.

At that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the
bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser.

Jetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to
something else he sees beyond it.

			JETSON
	Green light, Matthew.
		   (Sykes doesn't
		    respond)
	Green light!

Now Sykes looks.  The light at the intersection has just
turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting
start coming.  It's a wall of headlights coming right for
the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Shit!

			JETSON
	Ss-ai!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes locks up the brakes.  Kipling veers around a couple
of cars and speeds away.

Because of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of
action.  He skids a left onto a side street.


EXT.  SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a
right onto another street that parallels the street the
police unit is on.  At the first street available, he cuts
back in behind the police unit.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

Sykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the
police unit directly above them!  An on-ramp approaches
for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug-
mobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a
few feet behind the black-and-white's bumper.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

With the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right,
cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto--


EXT.  SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT

The police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street
tunnel.  It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a
pile-up of traffic behind the police unit.

The slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of
traffic in the tunnel.  Sykes is out of the drivers door
in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--

			SYKES
	Move your goddamned cars!

People climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --
ignoring Sykes.  Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his
bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car
far enough forward to get around.  He speeds off.


INT./ EXT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT

Kipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp.  Harcourt smiles
with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile
behind them.  Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of
traffic.


EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT

Sykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian
traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at
Indianapolis.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead.

			JETSON
	There!

Sykes sees it.  Thinking fast, he eases off, using another
car as a blind.  He waits until the police unit is
parallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right,
directly for the police unit.

Kipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile
broadsides the police unit.  Sykes forces the police unit
up the off-ramp.


EXT.  INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Door handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the
right.  The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes
stays right on its ass.  They charge up onto--


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

The police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80
MPH.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As the cars scream along, Jetson cranes out the side
window, looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing
past below.


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

They reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

A clear two lane straightaway near the ocean.  Sykes
pushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the
police unit.  The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.
Kipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,
slowing him down.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Kipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror,
then looks back out the front to see the end of the road
coming up fast!  Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on
the brakes.


EXT.  END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain
link fence where the road ends.  An abandoned drawbridge
and the ocean are on the other side of the fence.

With nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at
Kipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The two cars are racing for a full head-on.  At the last
instant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile
sideways, passenger side first.  The police unit smashes
into the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both
cars skidding madly to a stop.  A fire ignites under the
hood of the police unit.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes sits stunned behind the wheel.  Disoriented but
conscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees Jetson
out cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding.  Then he looks
over and sees the fire growing under the police unit's
hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug-
mobile -- near the gas tank.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to
Jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge
unconscious alien away from the cars.

He's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt
pulling himself through the smashed police unit window.
Bruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the
suitcase, then starts to run with it.

With Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes
clambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off
after Harcourt.

Harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the
closed drawbridge.  He heaves the suitcase over, then
starts to climb.

Sykes lumbers past the burning police unit.  Kipling is
still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward.  Sykes
is just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods
and door panels and glass flying in all directions.
Harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the
suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the
abandoned drawbridge.

Sykes reaches the fence.  Instead of climbing, he simply
blows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the
gate.


EXT.  ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT

The end of the bridge is in the "up" position... a huge
asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky.  Harcourt
runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the
bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him.  His
foot slips once and he almost goes over the side.

Sykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a
prominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.

Harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --
and has nowhere to go.  He is backed into a corner, with
seawater on two side of him.  Harcourt pivots frantically,
sees Sykes coming this way.  Harcourt is a trapped animal.
His chest heaves in panic.  Then his gaze falls on the
suitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of
resolve comes into his eye.

ON SYKES

He eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows
Harcourt is.  There's some movement among the shadows, and
Sykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against
the trigger.

Perspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.
A long moment then--

ANGLE - THE SHADOWS

Harcourt emerges from the darkness.  His face is composed,
the superior glint is back in his eye.  His arms are held
away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in
surrender.

Sykes cat-steps forward slowly.  Harcourt stares at Sykes'
eyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an
excuse.  Harcourt simply... smiles.

			SYKES
	Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're
	history...

			HARCOURT
	No, Sergeant -- not history...
		   (beat)
	Eternity...

And now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of
the one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind
his arm.  He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,
then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.
The blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin.  His
mouth fills.

He looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes
mad, defiant.  And -- he swallows.  Long hold -- then the
wallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in
agony as he begins to convulse.  Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers
the Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and
goes into a massive violent seizure.  His limbs hammer
against the deck... his back arches fiercely.  It is a
brutal, agonizing ten seconds.  Then, finally, his body
becomes still.

Sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to
him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA

Sykes stands.  He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,
and hefts it.  He carries it with him back toward the
inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and
cold in his hand.

ANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES

He approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.  As he
passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register
that the driver's door of the police unit is now open
before--

-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!  Sykes
is thrown forward.  The suitcase crashes to the ground,
and the Casull goes skittering off.  Sykes looks up -- to
be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of
Kipling!  Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes
hears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.  He looks -- and
sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.  It
connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who
killed Bill Tuggle!

Kipling brings the suitcase above his head.  He is a half-
second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN
ROARS.  Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.  Sykes
looks.

ANGLE

Jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.

Kipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the
suitcase again.  Jetson, shaking but determined, fires
again, and again, and again.

Kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase
still over his head... until he is blasted at last and
forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the
inferno.

Sykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.  Jetson has
let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.
Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the
alien's hand.  The two partners remain like this, bathed
in the orange flickering glow of the fire.

HIGH WIDE SHOT

of the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two
cops...

				    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police mop-up is winding down.  Cop cars, coroner's
wagons, fire trucks.  We MOVE through it all to find Sykes
and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing.

			JETSON
	With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I
	assume you will be requesting
	reassignment now.

			SYKES
		   (cool)
	It'd be for your own good.  I think
	you'd be better off with a partner
	who's a little more... by the book.
		   (smiles)
	... Still, I gotta tell you, George,
	for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on
	wheels once you get going.  I'd
	kinda hate to miss your next two
	days as a detective.

Jetson smiles.  He glances up as they are bathed in red
and blue light.  A patrol car has pulled up next to them.
Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.

			WILTEY
	I'll give you guys a lift to the
	station.  They're waiting to take
	your statements on the shootings.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Let's go, partner.
		   (then casually
		    correcting Wiltey
		    as he rises)
	And it's shooting.  Singular.

			WILTEY
	They said two.

			SYKES
	Nope.  I didn't shoot Harcourt... he
	o.d.'d.

SHOCK CUT - JETSON

We rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward
Sykes.  His expression tells us his blood has just turned
to ice.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  CORONER'S WAGON - NIGHT

ANGLE FORWARD, shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward
the DRIVER and ATTENDANT up front.

			DRIVER
	So it's just me and her left in the
	hot tub, right?

			ATTENDANT
	You and the blonde?

			DRIVER
	No, man, the redhead.  The blonde's
	gone in the house with some other
	guy.  But a few minutes later she
	comes back out, alone, when me and
	the redhead are going at it fast and
	furious in the tub, ya know... and
	she sees us, and... she climbs right
	in with us...

			ATTENDANT
	You're full of shit!

			DRIVER
	I swear it!  If I'm lyin', I'm
	dyin'...

And, without warning, A LARGE INHUMAN HAND FLIES UP IN
F.G., having ripped through the sealed body bag just below
FRAME.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

Jetson is up front with Wiltey; Sykes sits in the back,
though he is on the edge of the seat, leaning forward
toward the front.  Jetson is intently, nervously scanning
ahead and to both sides.

			JETSON
	You are certain this is the route
	they would have taken?

			WILTEY
	I'm not positive -- but probably.

			SYKES
		   (warily)
	What's this about, George?  I know
	that look.

			JETSON
		   (spots something out
		    a side window)
	There!  Go back.  Down that side
	street.

Wiltey brakes, backs up, then turns into the side street.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

as they approach an eerie scene.  The coroner's wagon is
stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection,
headlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the
back doors wide open.  A patrol car is also here, on the
other side of the wagon.  There is no movement anywhere
near the two vehicles.

Wiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the
eerie scene.  He reaches for the radio hand mike.  Jetson
quickly covers it with a large hand.

			JETSON
	No!
		   (both Sykes and
		    Wiltey look at him)
	We must do this alone.

			SYKES
	Do what?!  George-- ?!

Jetson is already sliding out of the car.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns
drawn.  They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's
flashlight, shines it through the open back doors.  The
doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.
One of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from
end to end.  The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol
car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.

Jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,
Sykes and Wiltey follow.  Lights all ablaze, it too is
abandoned.  One door has been wrenched off its hinges and
lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.
Our three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots
something beyond the unit.

			WILTEY
	Oh, God...

Sykes and Jetson look.

The bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as
well as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed
and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt.  Their arms
are twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down
the street toward the dock warehouses ahead.  Wiltey
stumbles away, backward.

			WILTEY
	I'm calling for back up, now.

			JETSON
	Wiltey, no.

But Wiltey is going.  Jetson starts after him... but Sykes
grabs his arm, hard, and spins him.

			SYKES
	What is this?!

			JETSON
		   (low)
	... It's Harcourt.

			SYKES
	Harcourt is dead.

			JETSON
	No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on
	the drug.
		   (searches for the
		    words)
	Massive amounts trigger a... a
	change.  Your body functions seize
	up, you appear to be dead, but it's
	really a state of incubation.  When
	you emerge you're...

			SYKES
		   (looks at the four
		    bodies sprawled
		    before him)
	Tell me about it...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

One minute later.  OPEN CLOSE on a light shining into
CAMERA, then WIDEN to reveal it is one of the door-mounted
spotlights on Wiltey's patrol car.  Wiltey eases the car
down the center of the street.  Sykes and Jetson, guns
ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes
everywhere.

MOVING POV

as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching
for any signs of movement.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as
they walk.  Their eyes everywhere.

			SYKES
	I never thought I'd say this, but --
	for once in my life I think I'm
	willing to wait for back-up.

			JETSON
	We can't let him get away.

			SYKES
	Why the hell are you so dead set
	against back-up?

			JETSON
		   (a difficult
		    admission)
	Because... because of what will
	happen if humans see what we are
	capable of becoming.

			SYKES
	But there's no more drug.

			JETSON
	You understand that.  But how many
	others will?

Sykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression.

Just then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across
his headlight beams fifty yards ahead.  Whatever it was,
was large and fast.  It darted into an open warehouse
door.

			WILTEY
	There he is!

And Wiltey floors it.  Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to
stop him.

			JETSON
	Wiltey!

He and Sykes take off running.  Wiltey skids to the left,
rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.
Sykes and Jetson pour it on.  They hear a SCREECH OF
BRAKES.  They reach the warehouse door and race through.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

LOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's
stopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear
around the corner of the warehouse door.  The car is still
running -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling
fumes.  The feet slow... then cautiously start around the
car.  We PAN with them as they move around the side of the
car.  A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G.  We
MOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper.  The dark liquid
is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome.  We MOVE
UP farther, and--

-- there is Wiltey's severed head.  IN CLOSE UP, resting
on the hood of the patrol car.

Sykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight.  Wiltey's body
lies in a heap on the floor near the car.  They both
stare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the
warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have
done this so fast?

THEIR POV

There are two paths to go.  Both dark and scary as hell.
The sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and
DRIPS of this waterfront building.

ANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON

Jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun
from the dash mount.  He checks the chamber as Sykes
checks the Casull.

They exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they
split up.  Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the
right.

WITH JETSON

As he moves into a dark area.  He slowly picks his way
along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled
debris, heading toward us.  We PAN slightly to the left to
HOLD a door in CLOSE UP.  The door, already ajar, eases
open slightly wider.  Jetson hears this.  He reaches the
door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all
the way.  There's nothing inside... now.

Jetson looks up, sees movement in the distance.  It is
Sykes, quite far away, in another section of the
warehouse.  Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Sykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head
as he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER.
He eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table
and a chair.  On the table is a mini-television, tuned to
some local late night talk show.  There's a thermos, a
steaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite
out of it beside the TV.  The chair is empty, except for a
jacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched
on the breast.  The guard is nowhere in sight.

Sykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight.
He looks around, then continues on.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a
set of stairs leading to an upper floor.  The top of the
stairs is pitch black.  Jetson adjusts his grip on the
shotgun, slowly starts up the stairs.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT

Sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging
from the ceiling.  He has no alternate route -- he begins
pushing through them.

SYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS

Because of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack
of nets immediately before him.  He keeps wading through
-- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much
farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the
deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the
way he came.  He pushes past one particular rack of nets
and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is--

-- a terrifying face!

ON SYKES

He stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the
Casull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is.
It's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship.
The wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous
visage.  Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start
his heart again.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Jetson moves along the rickety planks.  He comes to a
door.  He eases it open, enters.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the shadowy confines.  He hears an
incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner.  He moves
to it.  Turns the spigot, stopping the drip.  Other drips
are HEARD from a dozen other hidden recesses all around
him.  He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the
wall above the sink.  Suddenly he sees the movement of
something behind him.  He spins with the shotgun.  A huge
shadow moves along the wall.  He pivots the shotgun again
-- toward the source of the shadow.

It's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the
ceiling.  Jetson lets out a deep breath.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway.
A strand of something hangs in FRAME in OUT OF FOCUS F.G.
It makes an indistinct, rhythmic CLINKING SOUND.  Sykes
moves along the intersecting hallway.  The CLINKING SOUND
catches his attention.  He stops, listens, then starts
down the passageway, toward us.

He comes forward into the storage room, having to get very
close to the strand of something before he sees what it
is.  It's a double strand of chain, CLINKING gently
against itself.  Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain,
silencing it.  He considers.  It could've been a natural
occurrence... or something could have brushed against it,
setting it in motion.  He tightens his grip on the Casull,
backing away from the chain.  He senses something behind
him and spins.  Nothing there.  He relaxes.  However--

Behind him now, in SOFT FOCUS, we glimpse movement at the
other end of the short passageway.  It is a figure, moving
slowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the
hallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway
as it approaches Sykes.  It stops, inside the room now,
directly behind Sykes.  Close enough to reach out and
touch him.  It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more
powerful.

Suddenly, Sykes senses something is there.  He turns,
slowly, and--

SHOCK CUT - HARCOURT

as he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last
time Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge.  Only this
time it is a horribly transformed Harcourt.  His eyes are
red-rimmed and piggish.  His head is lumpen, his skin
thick and hard.  His neck muscles are corded -- giving him
a kind of hellish cobra's cowl.  There is still
intelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral
intelligence now.

			HARCOURT
		   (his voice a guttural
		    rumble)
	Looking for me, Sergeant?

Sykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the
Casull, and fires.  The powerful Casull round catches
Harcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back.


EXT.  WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT

Jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing
blast of the Casull.  He gauges as best he can the
direction it came from and takes off running.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

Harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact.  The
cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder-
burned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin.
Harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts
toward Sykes.

Scared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires.  One of his shots
misses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head.  The
remaining shots strike Harcourt full on.  Harcourt is
jerked by the impact of the bullets each time, SNARLING in
anger -- but none of the hits stop him.  The Casull is
empty and Harcourt keeps coming.

Sykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash.
Harcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard.  We
HEAR the POP as the shoulder dislocates.  Sykes HOLLERS,
and the gun jumps out of his hand.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Jetson races in, shotgun ready.  The last of Sykes' shots
are still ECHOING.  Jetson looks around, frustrated,
unable to tell exactly where they are coming from.  He
sees the likely path and charges that way.


EXT.  DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

On the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these
rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,
having been thrown ruthlessly from above.  As Sykes' body
sprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt
appears at the top of the stairs.

Sykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.
Harcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the
railing the last fifteen feet.  Harcourt lurches forward
and, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him
down the docks.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

The first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at
the coroner's wagon.  The Officers leap out, flagging
other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Sykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost
collapses again.  Harcourt comes at him.  Then Sykes sees
it--

-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of
the jetties.  Sykes makes a break for it.


EXT.  WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,
frantically scanning for any sign of Sykes.  Then, in the
distance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty
-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt.  Jetson
gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive
look, then gathers up his courage, and races down the
stairs to help Sykes.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty.  The fishing boat is
already passing the end of the jetty.  Harcourt is fast
behind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults
off toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing
net piled on the rear deck.  He yells in pain as his ankle
twists under his weight.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,
relieved that he has escaped.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Harcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes
did, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then
onto a second jetty.  And from here, he vaults across the
seawater onto the boat.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the
cabin.  The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the
open sea.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson sees this and is shitting bricks.  Suddenly the
stark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from
above.  Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,
the sun-gun washing over the docks.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically
waving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down.  The
Pilot starts to take it down.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net
toward the back of the boat.  Harcourt gets one hand on
his leg.  Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws
dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls
away.  Sykes BELLOWS in pain.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the
dock.  He has to catch himself from falling out the open
door.  Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto
the dock.

			JETSON
	On that boat -- out there!

Jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth
of the channel.  The helicopter tilts forward and goes.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging
over the stern of the fishing boat.  He pushes to the back
of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the
bow.  Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey
trapped.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the
channel water racing past beneath.  They come up on the
boat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck,
looking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt
at the stern dinghy.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back
at what the sun-gun spotlights.  He sees Harcourt standing
at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.

			CAPTAIN
	Hey!


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.
He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.  He rears back
with it and lets it fly like a spear.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.
The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back
against the throttle.  The boat lunges forward as the
engines REV loudly.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.  As
Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie
line on the dinghy.  He lunges forward, throwing the
ratchet.  The line plays out, and the dinghy slides
backward into water!


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson watches this happen.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

The dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie
line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.

Harcourt claws his way toward Sykes.  Water is already
splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is
sinking.  Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward
him.  Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his
might.  Harcourt yanks him free.  Sykes kicks wildly at
the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the
line.  Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--

-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.  The rest
of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the
dinghy from the fishing boat!

The dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.  A wave from
the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.  Some
of it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.  Sykes
sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is
on him again.  Sykes' body weight at the side of the
dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to
wash in over the transom.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy
below.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

Harcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in
agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water
touches.  Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.  Harcourt
sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib
cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt
off balance.  Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the
first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of
them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the
dinghy.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically
clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still
above the water.  Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's
partially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top
of Sykes, and drags him under.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting
to help, knowing he can't.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a
body unmoving but still on top of him.  Sykes shoves it
away, struggling to stay afloat.  His head keeps dunking
under.  He's drowning.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot.

			JETSON
	Take it down!  Take it down!


EXT.  WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.
Jetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking
under again.  The helicopter's skids are three feet above
the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	ALL THE WAY!

			PILOT
	I CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!

Sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but
the skid is just too high.  Jetson has no alternative, and
he does the bravest thing he has ever done.  He moves out
onto the narrow helicopter skid.  Hanging on, three feet
above the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching
hand.

The fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from
each other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the
two hands meet!  Jetson winces from the pain of the
seawater on Sykes' hand.  He starts pulling Sykes up.
When--

HARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'
FACE.  His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone.  The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,
breaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under
again.

Jetson is frantic.  He keeps waiting -- but this time
Sykes doesn't come up.  Jetson doesn't know what to do.
Finally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot
from the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his
own arm below the surface!  He feels around, gets hold of
something, and pulls.  It is Sykes' wrist.  He pulls hard,
bringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	Take it up!

The Pilot does.  Sykes comes up out of the water.  His
feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand
and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.
Sykes looks down in horror.  The helicopter keeps moving
up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm
tears away from the torso at the shoulder.  Sykes wildly
shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it
falls back into the water below.

Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it
moves off toward shore.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Sykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his
limp arm.  Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket,
wrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain.
The Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they
just pulled Sykes from.

			PILOT
	What the hell was that down there?
	It was weird.

Jetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say.  Sykes
looks at Jetson a long moment, then--

			SYKES
	Looked like every other damn slag to
	me.  Just plain ugly.

Despite the pain, Jetson smiles.

				 LONG DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY

We are CLOSE on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time,
trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling.  A
PAIR OF ALIEN ARMS reach into FRAME to help him.  One of
the alien arms is also in a sling.

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the alien is Jetson.  Both men wear
tuxedos.

			SYKES
	How do I look?

			JETSON
	You look very good.

There's a knock at the door.  Sykes opens it.  There
stands Sykes' daughter, KRISTIN, twenty years old, looking
radiant in her wedding dress.  She is in a foyer, and
behind her is the interior of the church with all the
assembled guests, including Mrs. Jetson & son.

			KRISTIN
	Ready, Daddy...?

Sykes' heart melts.  Before moving to the door:

			SYKES
	George, uh... I want to apologize
	now, in advance, for all the rotten
	things I'll ever say or do to you
	over the years.

Sykes moves to join his daughter.  As he does:

			JETSON
	That is all right, Matthew.  After
	all, you are only human.

Sykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	What a wildman...

Sykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start
down the aisle.

				    FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT.  MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)

A LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering
just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.
The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-
scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its
true shape and appearance indistinct.

The VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then
pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles
and personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted
scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the
armed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on
the horizon.  Waiting.

The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it
moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a
second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards
behind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck
beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes
glued to the distant object.

The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked
local TV van, finds the object again in the distance,
zooms in, and waits, like everyone else.

Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box
CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.

			CRAIS
	That was the scene in California's
	Mojave Desert three years ago today
	-- the historic first view of the
	Newcomer ship upon its dramatic
	arrival.  As with the assassination
	of John Kennedy, who among us does
	not remember exactly where he was
	that October nineteenth morning,
	when news first broke: that people
	have landed... from another star.

We PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal...


INT.  A CROWDED BAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar.

The off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly
ignoring the TV, except for two detectives, FEDORCHUK and
ALTEREZ, who are waiting for the ball scores.

			FEDORCHUK
	I remember where I was -- pissing
	off my balcony at the neighbor's
	dog!

Others laugh.

			ALTEREZ
		   (yells at Crais on TV)
	Get to the goddamn ball scores!

ON THE TV SCREEN, an on-location interview with a CAL-TECH
PROFESSOR comes up.  Her name and title appear across the
bottom of the screen.

			CAL-TECH PROFESSOR
	From the time mankind first gazed up
	at the stars there had been
	speculation about a visit by people
	from "out there."  How ironic that
	when that first contact was made,
	the two hundred and sixty thousand
	occupants aboard the craft were as
	surprised as we were about their
	arrival.  That they awakened from
	frozen hibernation to find their
	malfunctioning autopilot had landed
	them here by mistake.

The CNN reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again.

			CRAIS
	These "Newcomers," we soon learned,
	were a genetically-engineered race,
	adapted for hard labor in almost any
	environmental condition.  In effect,
	their ship was a slave ship...
	washed ashore on Earth with no way
	to get back to where they came
	from...

A dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses CUTS ACROSS
FRAME, and we PAN WITH IT as it is slammed down on the
countertop.

Now an interview with a FRESNO HOUSEWIFE standing outside
a supermarket comes on the TV SCREEN.

			FRESNO HOUSEWIFE
	When the Newcomers were first let
	out of the ship, they were
	quarantined in a camp not ten miles
	from the town here.  You can imagine
	how the people around here felt
	about that.  But once they were
	releases from the camp and we got a
	chance to know them, we saw what
	nice, quiet people they really are...

WIDER

revealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white
busboy's uniform.  His back is to us as he picks up two
trays from the counter.  The bartender is dwarfed by this
Newcomer, but works around him without apparent concern.
Fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy.

			FEDORCHUK
	Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?
	Workin' hard?

The Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but
disturbingly alien.

			FEDORCHUK
	You got your green card, buddy?  You
	didn't leave home without it?

The cops at the bar crack up.  Henry looks at Fedorchuk --
his eyes carrying no malice... or pain.  He merely blinks.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - STREET - NIGHT

An explosion of color and movement as OPENING TITLES PLAY
very quickly.  We're TRAVELING the streets in a n.d.
sedan, getting MOVING GLIMPSES of the aliens living among
us now:

-- A coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables.

-- A Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of
books.

-- A city park where a number of alien families have
gathered to play some arcane alien game.

			SYKES
	Jeez... they call that gang-bang a
	game...?

-- A billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien.

-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light.
Suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes'
head... and alien hand.  Sykes jumps.  It's a NEWCOMER
DERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own
language.  In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of
milk.  We know immediately what he wants.  Sykes rolls
down the window.

			SYKES
	Take a hike.

Sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light
changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the
street.  Sykes grimaces at the smell.

			SYKES
	Why's it have to be sour milk that
	these guys get wasted on?  What the
	hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or
	Thunderbird for chrissakes?
		   (beat; disgusted)
	Slagtown.  Shit...

-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes.

-- Alien hookers plying their trade.

			SYKES
	Hope their plumbing's the same.

			TUGGLE
	It is.
		   (and Sykes gives him
		    a look)

-- A Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile.

-- An alien couple exit a theater playing "Terminator
III".

-- An alien wig shop.

ANGLE

TITLES END, and we start to PULL BACK into the slug-mobile
and HEAR:

			TUGGLE (O.S.)
	So you gonna go, or you not gonna
	go?


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

The dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two
coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the
windshield.  A hand picks up one of the coffees and we
FOLLOW IT to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen
some wear and tear -- behind the wheel is MATT SYKES.
Beside him is his partner of nine years, BILL TUGGLE.
Tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.

			SYKES
	How can I go?

			TUGGLE
	Put on your wash-and-wear suit and
	your clip-on tie, have your landlady
	tie your shoes for you, and show up
	at the church.  Simple.
		   (beat)
	Me and Carol are going.

			SYKES
	What?

			TUGGLE
	Hey, look -- we've known Kristin
	since... since she was conceived in
	that cabin up in Big Bear.
	Remember?  You and Edie banged the
	wall so hard, me and Carol were
	picking plaster out of our hair for
	a week...

			SYKES
	Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see
	Kristin get married, okay?  But--

			TUGGLE
	But you're bummed because your ex
	and her new husband are paying for
	the whole thing.

			SYKES
	Shit, if Kristin had to get married
	where I could afford it, we'd be
	holding the reception at Buddy's
	Burgers.

Sykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed-off
mood.  Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop
radar.

			SYKES
	Uh-oh... Check it out.

THROUGH THE WINDOW Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two ALIENS
in long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom-
and-pop mini-mart on the corner.  One of them wears dark
glasses and a red bandana (KIPLING): the other has on a
black vinyl raincoat.

			SYKES
	Does that look at all suspicious to
	you?

			TUGGLE
	Whatever gave you that idea?


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb
among other parked cars.


INT.  SEDAN - NIGHT

Sykes is already pulling his gun.  Tuggle quickly reaches
for the radio in the glovebox.

			TUGGLE
	This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a
	possible two-eleven in progress at
	Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court
	and Alvarado.  Requesting backup.

Impulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing
out.

			SYKES
	Let's do it, partner.

Tuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio
Dispatcher confirms the call.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked
cars across the street from the mini-mart.  Through the
store window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the
counter.  His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat
and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it
right at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun
and covers the door.

Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.

			SYKES
	You got your vest?

			TUGGLE
	Of course.  Right in the trunk of
	the car.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.

Through the store window the robbery continues in
pantomime.  Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,
yelling orders in the alien language.  The Proprietor is
quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.
The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands
in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The
Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.

Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the
street from the store entrance.

			TUGGLE
	Watch the driver.  I'm going for a
	better angle on the door.

			SYKES
	I got him.  Don't get pinned.

Tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-
corner across the intersection.

Through the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag
of cash, shove it in his coat pocket.  Bills fall out, but
he doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up
the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's
chest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,
slides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and
FIRES another round into the Proprietor.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	Aw, shit.

Tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the
shots.

The human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a
few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots
Tuggle.  He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine
pistol on the seat next to him.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk.  They
spot Tuggle through the store window and open fire --
BLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS.

A civilian car enters the intersection.  The engine is hit
by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the
intersection, steam rising from the radiator.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Tuggle dives behind a lamp post.

The Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine
pistol to fire at Tuggle.  Sykes sees this and opens fire
at the Driver.  The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.
Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is
sprayed with bullets.

A forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between
Sykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is
standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He
rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.

Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the
shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.

			SYKES
	Get outta there!

			TUGGLE
	I can't!  Do you mind!

			SYKES
	I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!

Sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway
car, firing toward the store as he goes.

Kipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.

Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp
post and runs to the stalled civilian car.  He slides
across the hood and drops behind the car for cover.
Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car
window.  His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver
who is still inside the car.

			OLD MAN
	Can I get out now?

			TUGGLE
	Move it!

Sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in
the store.  As he considers his next move--

Tuggle fires at the two aliens.  They return fire and he
slides down to safety behind the car.  Or so he thinks.
Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by
the shotgun blasts.  He flinches as another blast hits the
car.  He looks over.  There's a big exit hole in the
fender beside him.  THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.
Another exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.

Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS
and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of
the car.  He has nowhere left to go and--

-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely
in the chest throwing him back onto the street.

Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of
nine years blown away.

Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his
shotgun CLICKS empty.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Kipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit
of the store.  The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands.
The two of them run out the back.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Sykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body.  One glance is
enough.  Nobody ever looked deader.

			SYKES
	Aw shit, Tug, Jesus!  Goddamn it!

He stares, shocked and incredulous.  He can't find a way
to think or feel about this.  Then we see him going crazy
right before our eyes, the rage revving.  He takes off
toward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching
in background.


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

Sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken
glass, bangs through the exit.


EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round
the corner at the far end of the alley.  He takes off,
quickly cranking up to full speed.


EXT.  BACK STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds the corner.  Doesn't see them anymore.  He
slows... moves along this street with some caution.  Lots
of shadows, lots of hiding places.  Sykes HEARS a NOISE,
looks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge
billboard.  He cuts loose with the shotgun.  Sykes dives.
Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the
night.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the
crates.

Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings
down off the fire escape, runs off.

Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.


EXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT

Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.
The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up
ahead.  Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.


INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT

The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves
through the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so
he can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing
along the asphalt.

Then he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid
footsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from
which direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges
for him with an alien CRY.

It's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just
in time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat
alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the
blasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an
inhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes
with outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and
FIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down
and stays down.

Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS
it... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes
looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly
above!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold
onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the
gun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming
the gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet,
but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel.

A SIREN is HEARD approaching in background.

Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he
draws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND
again.

SYKES' P.O.V.

Though his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look
at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The
strands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.

ANGLE

The alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching
SIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings
onto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and
leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.

ON SYKES

dazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS
approaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused.

SYKES' P.O.V.

An OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him.

ANGLE

Sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his
weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien
face.  The alien, caught by surprise and off balance,
sprawls backward OUT OF FRAME.  Sykes is grabbed by a
human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.

			HUMAN COP
	Whoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy.
		   (to alien on the
		    ground)
	You okay?

Sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus.  He looks at
the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet
away.  The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON.

			JETSON
	I am all right.

He gets up.  A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.

			HUMAN COP
	I better call in.

He moves off.  Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat
alien's body.  Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might
retaliate in some way.  But Jetson simply steps past him
to kneel beside the dead alien.  He checks for a pulse on
the underside of the dead alien's upper arm.  Nothing.
Sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain.  He
struggles to rise.  Jetson gets an arm around him to help
him up.

			JETSON
	Your hand will require attention.

Sykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip.

			SYKES
	Get the hell away from me!  I don't
	need your goddamn help.

He almost loses his balance and has to steady himself
against the tunnel wall.  Sykes leans there, the picture
of impotent rage and frustration.  Jetson looks at him,
with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit
when trying to understand human nature.


EXT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

OPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over
his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the
Coroner's wagon.

WIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.  The
Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD
black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of
them aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some
alien).  He moves into:


INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT

The CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs
out of the wall, photographing everything.  Several
UNIFORMED COPS mill around.  Sykes moves aimlessly around
the room like a stranger at a party.

The Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange
rigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from
her lips.  A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get
her away from the body, but can't get her to budge.

MINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the
Raincoat alien dropped here.  NATUZZI, a mean-looking
veteran uniform cop is with him.

			NATUZZI
	Looks like a standard combat pump-
	action.

			MINKLER
	It is.

			NATUZZI
	So what punched holes clear through
	that car out there?

Minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box.
Inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.

			MINKLER
	BRI Sabot slugs.  These puppies are
	nasty.  Two plastic sabots fall away
	in flight leaving a fifty-caliber
	slug going two thousand feet per
	second.  Tug might as well've been
	hiding behind a rosebush.

Minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him.
He looks.  It's Sykes.

			NATUZZI
	Pretty heavy artillery for knocking
	over a liquor store.

A new voice enters the conversation.

			JETSON (O.S.)
	An identical round was used in the
	shooting of a Newcomer named
	Hubley, two days ago.

Sykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to
see the voice is Jetson's.

			MINKLER
	Yeah?  So why the extra fire power?

			JETSON
	Perhaps because even the larger
	caliber handguns aren't always
	effective against my people.

			SYKES
		   (mulls this, then)
	You saying there's some connection
	to this other homicide?

Before Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to
the Proprietor's Wife steps up.

			FEMALE COP
	Hey, give me a hand with this woman,
	will ya Jetson?  We've got to get
	her to Division for her statement
	and she won't budge.

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes)
	Excuse me.

And he moves off with his partner.  Sykes calls after him,
but Jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't
turn.

			SYKES
	So, you think there's a connection,
	or what?  Hey!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  SYKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The slug-mobile pulls up.  A drained Sykes moves up the
walk to his front door.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place
decorated with negative taste.  It's obviously the maid's
decade off.

By rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering
machine on his way into the kitchen.  The tape rewinds.
He opens the fridge.  Not much here.  Left-over take-out
pizza carton.  Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons.
Left-over take-out burger wrappers. 

The answering machine message begins -- he glances over
his shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE.  During the
following, he reaches the fridge.  Brings out a milk
carton that's in his way, sets it on the counter.  Reaches
in again and this time brings out a bottle of Stoly.  Then
searches for a semi-clean glass.

			KRISTIN'S VOICE
		   (bouncy, bride-to-be
		    happy)
	Hi, Daddy, it's me.  I'm over at
	Danny's parents' house... talking
	about Sunday.  I thought maybe you'd
	be home by now.  Anyway, uh, nothing
	really.  I just wanted to call and
	say I love you.  I love you, Daddy.
		   (she giggles)
	Uh-oh, I shouldn't'a done that.
	Knowing you, you'll probably pull
	this tape out of your machine and
	save it -- in that drawer where you
	keep every card I ever gave you, and
	all of my old baby teeth... gross!
	Anyway, Daddy, don't save this tape
	-- but I do love you, and I'll talk
	to you before Sunday.
		   (beat)
	Oh, Tug and Carol came by and met
	Danny last week.
		   (Sykes stiffens)
	Danny thought Tug was the greatest
	-- but, then, who doesn't?  Anyway,
	love you, talk to you soon.  'Bye.

The machine BEEPS and HISSES.  Sykes take the glass and
the bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room,
switching off the answering machine as he goes.

Then he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of
the machine and tosses it into a drawer.

				    FADE TO:

INT.  DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Sykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee.  He's slept about
four hours, and his face looks like he went a few with
Hagler.  He crosses straight to Fedorchuk's desk.

			SYKES
	So what've you got on Tuggle's
	killers?

			FEDORCHUK
	Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than
	ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on
	it, okay?

			SYKES
	You don't have squat.

			FEDORCHUK
	You ever try to make a case in
	Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer
	informants is about as long as the
	list of Mexican war heroes...

			ALTEREZ
	Up yours.

			FEDORCHUK
	... Nobody talks to nobody down
	there.  Half of them don't speak
	English and the other half only when
	it suits them.  It's gonna take some
	time.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I know it's gonna take time.
	Like until the Ice Capades opens in
	Hell, with you two on it.

Across the room, the Captain's door BANGS open and CAPTAIN
WARNER pounds out, his deep voice booming through the
squad room.

			WARNER
	Nobody wanders off!  I got an
	announcement.  Get your asses back
	in here.

Two detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into
the room.  Everybody gathers around, curious, as Warner
stands holding a sheet of paper.

			WARNER
	I'll make this short.  This is a
	directive from Chief Evaner, who is
	acting on orders from the Mayor, who
	is under mandate from the Federal
	Bureau of Newcomer Relations.  As of
	nine o'clock this morning, one
	Newcomer uniform officer has been
	promoted to the rank of Detective,
	third grade.

The detectives GROAN... some angrier ones grumble, "This
is bullshit!", etc.

			WARNER
	And we've got him, gentleman.
		   (more groans)
	Volunteers for duty with the new
	detective should see me in my
	office... otherwise I will choose a
	volunteer myself.  That is all.

He turns and heads back to his office in the wake of
continued grumbling from the detectives.  Sykes, standing
to one side, absently watches Warner return to his glass-
walled office.  Waiting inside are a balding man and an
alien in a grey suit.  Sykes reacts.  The alien in the
suit is Jetson.

The grumbling continues around him as Sykes considers
something.

			FEDORCHUK
	Unbelievable bullshit.

			ALTEREZ
	How long has this Slag been on the
	force?  A year, max -- right?

			DETECTIVE
	I don't know about the rest of you,
	but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit
	still for this.  I'm calling the
	union, pronto.

Others grumble.  "Yeah!".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided
something.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk
sees this.

			FEDORCHUK
	Where the hell is he going?


INT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY

Sykes KNOCKS and enters.

			WARNER
	Yeah, Sykes?

			SYKES
	Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for
	duty with the new detective.

Warner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes.

			WARNER
	... All right.  Detective Sergeant
	Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson.

			JETSON
	We have met.

Warner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes,
starting to smell something fishy.

The balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands.

			GOLDRUP
	Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office.
	Congratulations, gentlemen.

Warner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to.

			WARNER
		   (to Sykes)
	You are to have nothing to do with
	the investigation into Bill Tuggle's
	death.  You know that.  Leave that
	for Fedorchuk.

			SYKES
		   (nodding)
	Departmental policy.

			WARNER
		   (to Jetson)
	You?

			JETSON
	Yes, sir.

			WARNER
	Good.

			SYKES
	There's another case I'd like to
	take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer
	named Hubley.

Jetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something.
Sykes avoids his look.

			WARNER
	Granger and Pitts are already on it.

			SYKES
	Granger and Pitts have one hell of a
	caseload... and I would have thought
	with Jetson here being the first
	Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's
	body being found over in the
	Newcomer community...

			WARNER
	Don't tell me what to think.

			GOLDRUP
	He's got a point.  That's the sort
	of thing we should be doing with
	this early advancement program...

Long-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally
sighs with resignation.  Sykes grins.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

The steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next
to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks
like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all
the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during:

			SYKES
	... and we work my hours.  I'll do
	the driving, you do the paperwork.
	You gotta learn it so you might as
	well do it all.

			JETSON
		   (after a moment)
	Sergeant... I'd like to thank you
	for what you're doing.

			SYKES
	What's that?
		   (then realizing)
	Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in
	your head.  We're not pals, we're
	not married, and we ain't gonna take
	long moonlight walks together...
	We're just partners.  And don't call
	me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or
	Matt if you have to.

			JETSON
	I am George.

Sykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half
steps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up
cold.

			SYKES
	Wait a minute.  George?  George
	Jetson?

Jetson nods... he's used to this.
Sykes cracks up.

			SYKES
		   (between laughs)
	Man, somebody really hung one on
	you!  I've heard some good ones for
	you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley
	Davidson.  I guess the people at
	immigration got a little punchy
	after a while, coming up with names
	for a quarter of a million of you.
	You weren't at the back of the line,
	were you, George?

			JETSON
	My true name is Ss'tangya
	T'ssorentsa'.

			SYKES
	Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I
	stick to George, do you?


EXT.  POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY

They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Anyway, what's it matter to you if
	we think it's funny, right?  Whatta
	you care?

			JETSON
	That is exactly so.
		   (completely deadpan)
	It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm
	sure it doesn't bother you at all
	that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss",
	two words in my language which mean
	"excrement" and "cranium".

Sykes looks at him, perplexed.

			JETSON
	"Shit... head".

Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing
there, the smirk dropping from his face.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAY

They're cruising along in downtown traffic.  Sykes drives.
Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat.

			SYKES
	Let's talk Hubley.

			JETSON
		   (refers to a folder
		    he holds)
	His body was discovered three days
	ago, in an alley off of Central
	Avenue, near downtown.

			SYKES
	With two BRI Sabot slugs in the
	chest.

			JETSON
		   (gently correcting
		    him)
	Through the chest.  Rupturing both
	the primary and secondary hearts.

			SYKES
		   (out the window)
	Nice signal, dickwad!

Jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes.
Then...

			JETSON
	He was employed at the Northwest
	Petroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He
	was manager of the Methane Facility.
	He was also a principle partner in a
	real estate venture to develop low-
	cost housing for Newcomers.

Sykes grimaces at the mention of "Newcomer housing".

			SYKES
	Terrific.  A real pillar of the
	community.
		   (beat)
	Was Hubley missing anything when
	they found him?  Was he ripped off?

			JETSON
		   (checks file)
	There was no wallet... but he was
	still wearing a watch and two rings.

			SYKES
	The guys at the mini-mart last night
	made a half-assed stab at the money
	in the till -- but I don't think
	that's what they were there for.  I
	think we got us a couple'a
	executions on our hands, George...

			JETSON
	The murder at the mini-mart is not
	our case.  The Captain said--

Sykes looks over at Jetson, pissed.

			SYKES
	Look, you want to fit in here,
	right?  You want to learn how to get
	along?

			JETSON
	Yes.

			SYKES
	Well, there's a thing about
	partners, about being somebody's
	partner.  You do for each other.
	And other people's rules don't mean
	shit.  It's the rules set up between
	the two of you, that's all that
	counts.  Understand?
		   (Jetson nods)
	Okay.  Well, my friend and partner
	was shot last night and I'm after
	the shitbag that did it.  As my
	partner, I'm asking you to respect
	me and help me find him.

Jetson considers this several moments, then--

			JETSON
	And as my partner, I ask you to
	respect me and my desire not to
	break with procedure.

Sykes stares at him, exasperated.  Without warning, he
slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy
traffic, puts it in "Park." Jetson, who is already a
little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it.
HORNS instantly go crazy behind them.

			JETSON
	What is wrong?

			SYKES
		   (very calm)
	Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get
	something straight.  You agree that
	there's a good chance these two
	shootings are somehow related,
	right?

YELLING joins the HORNS outside.  Jetson is visibly
unsettled by the chaos.

			JETSON
	Well... yes, quite possibly.

			SYKES
	Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be
	willing to accept the theory,
	George, that... possibly... by
	examining the evidence from one case
	we might shed some small ray of
	light on the other?  Does that sound
	unreasonable to you?

			JETSON
	Yes... no, it is not unreasonable.
	Although I--

			SYKES
	Great.
		   (a relieved sigh)
	Well, I'm sure glad that's settled,
	aren't you?

And with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly
out.

			SYKES
	I think we're really starting to
	click now, George -- hmmm?

Jetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

WINTER, a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading
Sykes and Jetson along the hall.  He reads on the fly from
a case file in his hand.

			WINTER
	You know I've been over all this
	with Fedorchuk and Alterez this
	morning...

			SYKES
	Come on.  You got nothin' better to
	do, cushy county job like yours.


INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

They enter briskly through a swinging door.  They move
among the tables (some occupied, some not) during:

			WINTER
	Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck.
	Anyway, according to the sheet, the
	guy you nailed outside by the car--

			SYKES
	The human?

			WINTER
	Yeah... he was one Martin Helder.
	White male, twenty-seven.  Let's
	see... wrap sheet shows one armed
	robbery conviction, a couple for
	sale of a controlled substance.
	Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke
	when you stopped his clock.

They have reached a table holding a covered body.  Winter
unceremoniously throws back the cover.  There lies the
pale naked body of the Raincoat alien.

			JETSON
	Have you identified this one?

			WINTER
	So far he's a John Doe.  Or a Sam
	Slag, if you like.

Jetson smiles slightly out of politeness.

			WINTER
	No I.D. on him and -- well, you
	know, no fingerprints -- so it could
	be tough.  Your buddies this morning
	went through the mug book but
	couldn't make a facial match.

			SYKES
	Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with
	his hands in his back pockets.

Jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter
and Sykes continue talking off to one side.

			WINTER
		   (referring to
		    Raincoat alien)
	You took this gut out, too, didn't
	you?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			WINTER
	Lucky for you, you got him in both
	of his... well, what we loosely
	refer to as... hearts.

			SYKES
	Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my
	damn gun into him.

			WINTER
	That's the way these people are.
	You don't hit both pumps you just
	piss them off.

During this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over
-- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his
face.  He leans closer, examining the palm carefully.
Then he peels back the alien's upper lip.

Jetson frowns anew, with concern this time.  He looks
around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER.
Jetson motions him over.  Jetson begins questioning him
using the alien language.  Sykes and Winter nearby, remain
oblivious.

			WINTER
	Oh, here's an extra headshot if you
	need one.
		   (hands Sykes a
		    polariod of dead
		    alien's face)
	We're just about to start cutting
	in.  You're welcome to stick around
	if you want.  It's really
	fascinating stuff.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I'll bet.

Sykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in
earnest conversation.  He only catches snatches of the
alien language.  Bentner appears very unsettled by what
Jetson is telling him.  In response to Jetson's final
statement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something
Jetson has requested.  Sykes goes over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	What's this?  What's going on?

			JETSON
	Nothing.

			SYKES
		   (really suspicious
		    now)
	Nothing?

			JETSON
		   (looking away)
	Shouldn't we examine their personal
	effects?

Jetson moves off, leaving Sykes there wondering.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PROPERTY ROOM - COUNTY MORGUE - DAY

Two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents
onto a formica counter.  Sykes looks through the dead
alien's effects while Jetson goes through the human's.
ORTIZ, the college girl working the property counter, sits
nearby doing homework.

Jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown.

			JETSON
	What is this?

			SYKES
		   (looks, then)
	A rubber.  A condom.  You know...
	Coney Island whitefish?
		   (Jetson doesn't know
		    what one is)
	Men, human men, put them on their,
	uh -- penises -- to protect against
	having babies.
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it; Sykes turns
		    to Ortiz)
	You need this for anything?

			ORTIZ
	Nope, got my own.  Anything you guys
	don't use gets stuffed away in
	storage.

Sykes tears open the packet, unrolls the condom, dangles
it before Jetson.

			SYKES
	Get the picture?

			JETSON
		   (frowning)
	And that fits?

			SYKES
	Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It
	stretches.

			JETSON
	And still it fits?

Sykes looks at Jetson's serious expression.  He tosses the
condom and packet back into the counter and continues
searching.  A beat, then he can't stop himself -- he
steals a glance at Jetson's crotch.

Still searching, Sykes picks up one of the dead alien's
well-worn heavy work boots.  He grimaces... the sides and
soles are painted with a viscous black substance.  He very
tentatively sniffs it... and is grateful that it's not
what he thought it might be.

			SYKES
	What is this stuff?

Sykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe
it.  Jetson glances over.

			JETSON
	It is a resin.

Sykes looks at him... surprised that he knows.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Newcomers working near methane
	gasses at oil refineries must paint
	it on their boots to protect against
	sparks.

			SYKES
	How the hell do you know that?

			JETSON
	A large number of my people were
	hired by refineries because the
	methane fumes are not harmful to us.
	My spouse's brother is one.

			SYKES
	So the Slag they're cutting into
	upstairs worked at a refinery just
	like Hubley worked at a refinery.
		   (beat)
	I'd say that "possible" connection
	between the two cases just got a
	hell of a lot more possible.
		   (beat)
	Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk
	to the wife of the Slag store owner
	blown away last night.

			JETSON
	I believe I should interview the
	widow alone.

			SYKES
	Why the hell--?!
		   (realizes it's
		    because of his lack
		    of "bedside manner")
	Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.

				    CUT TO:

INT./ EXT.  MINI-MART - LATE AFTERNOON

The shattered windows have been covered with plywood.
Through the open doorway we see Jetson talking to the
Proprietor's Wife.  She studies a photo Jetson shows her,
nods her head, speaking rapidly in the alien language.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Sykes drives along beside the mammoth, steaming network of
buildings and pipes that make up the refinery.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Through the loud and smoky refinery we see Sykes walking
with the newly promoted Methane Section manager, O'NEAL,
in tie and shirtsleeves.  The workmen around them are both
human and Newcomer.

			O'NEAL
		   (yelling over the
		    roar)
	Mr. Hubley was an all right guy --
	and a damn good manager.  The men
	liked him.  I'm really gonna have to
	scramble to fill his shoes.

			SYKES
	Well, one of the men didn't like him
	so much...

They stop and Sykes hands O'Neal the polariod photo of
Raincoat alien.  They have stopped near the heavy
refrigeration-type door leading to the "METHANE SECTION".

Newcomer workers move in and out through the door during:

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo)
	You think this is the guy who did
	it?

			SYKES
	We think he could'a been involved,
	yeah.  You know him?

			O'NEAL
	To be honest, it's hard to say.  I
	hate to admit it but -- they all
	still kinda look alike to me.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Who else can I ask around here?

			O'NEAL
		   (looking at photo
		    again)
	Wait.  You know who it looks like?
	Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James
	Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He
	took the afternoon off.

			SYKES
	I think you're gonna find he's taken
	the rest of his life off.

O'Neal reacts.  Sykes notices the door to the Methane
Section.

			SYKES
	That where Anderson worked?

			O'NEAL
	Yes it is.
		   (some alien workers
		    come through the
		    door)
	Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas
	in there.  I don't know how these
	fellas do it.

Sykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the
door.  O'Neal watches Sykes' expression for signs of
suspicion.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - SYKES AND O'NEAL

We see Sykes hand O'Neal a card, then move off.  O'Neal
watches him briefly, then crosses to some steps and starts
up this way.
We PAN with him as he enters a door here on the second
level.

O'Neal enters, moves to a telephone, begins to dial.

INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - JETSON'S STREET - DUSK

We're SHOOTING THROUGH the slug-mobile window as Sykes
pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately
maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown.  Jetson's
WIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn
with a garden hose.  Jetson's son, age six, rides his
bicycle along the walkway.  Jetson, dressed in his suit
for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son.

Sykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes.

			SYKES
	Jesus.  Welcome back Ozzie and
	Harriet...

He HONKS the horn.  Jetson looks up, then moves to his
wife and kisses her goodbye.  Moves to his son, kisses him
on the top of his head.

Sykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his
derisive expression softens.  As corny as this tableau may
be, there's something very appealing about the innocence
of it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes.

Jetson starts to climb into the car, and we--

				    CUT TO:

INT.  RESTROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

CLOSE on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug
dispensers from a tuxedo pocket.  As the hand brings the
dispenser toward the face, we immediately recognize the
exotic silver bracelet worn by Kipling the night before.
It makes that distinctive CLINKING NOISE.  We PAN with the
hand to reveal Kipling's face... sans bandana and
sunglasses now.  He wears a black tuxedo.  He lets a small
dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his
tongue.  He swallows... and reacts as the rush from the
drug hits him.

The door to the men's room bangs open and a MIDDLE AGED
POLITICO enters, obviously drunk.

Kipling quickly pockets the dispenser, moves past the
Politico to the exit...

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes drives, heading for the Biltmore Hotel.

			JETSON
	Mrs. Porter is not taking her
	husband's death well.

			SYKES
		   (impatient)
	Did you learn anything?

			JETSON
	A week ago two men came to see her
	husband.  After they left, he was
	very frightened.  She identified one
	of the men from a photo I showed
	her.  It was Hubley.

			SYKES
	Aw-right.  What about the other guy?

			JETSON
	She didn't know him.  But she said
	her son might.

			SYKES
	Did you talk to him?

			JETSON
	He has not been home since that day.
	But she told me where to find him.

Sykes nods.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  MAIN BALLROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

The men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns.  Only
two of three Newcomers faces present.  Kipling threads his
way among the tables as the MAYOR, at the speaker's
platform, addresses the assembly.

			MAYOR
	... Our guest speaker tonight has
	done so much in his community and
	for his community in such a short
	period of time.  And I must say, as
	the founder of the first Newcomer
	owned and operated corporation in
	Southern California, he certainly
	has come quite far in the last few
	years.  Granted, not as far as he
	came in the years before reaching
	Los Angeles.

There is laughter from the VIPs.  Kipling slides into a
seat at one of the front tables.  He leans over and
whispers something into the ear of the person seated to
his right.  We see this CLOSE UP, and don't see who he is
whispering to yet.  Whoever it is, nods.

			MAYOR
		   (continuing)
	As Mayor of this city, it gives me
	great pleasure to introduce someone
	who has so readily made our city
	his home... and all of us who live
	here, his friends.  Ladies and
	gentlemen, William Harcourt.

The VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front
table.  At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to
capture WILLIAM HARCOURT, seated to Kipling's right.
Harcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer
entrepreneur... handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes
that glint with his piercing intellect.  He rises, smiling
warmly, steps past his striking ALIEN DATE seated to his
right, to make his way to the podium.  He shields his eyes
somewhat from the bright spotlight.

Once behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast
pocket as the applause ebbs.

			HARCOURT
	Thank you all for that very warm
	reception.
		   (pauses, smiles)
	I'm particularly grateful because I
	actually had the gall to write that
	in my notes: "Thank you all for that
	very warm reception".  Imagine how
	embarrassed I would've been if it
	hadn't have been such a warm
	reception.

The VIPs laugh.  He's won them over instantly with his
charm and candor.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT

Sykes, followed by a reluctant Jetson, bears down on
Harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his Date, and
Kipling.  We see Kipling recognize Sykes from their fight
two nights before... but because Kipling looks so
different, Sykes doesn't recognize him outright.  Still,
during this, Sykes senses something, though he's not sure
what.

			SYKES
	William Harcourt?

			HARCOURT
	Yes...

			SYKES
	I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is
	Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police
	Department.

			HARCOURT
		   (nodding greeting)
	Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't
	aware there were any Newcomers at
	the rank of Detective yet.

			JETSON
	I am the first.

			HARCOURT
	Congratulations.  This is my
	administrative assistant, Rudyard
	Kipling.

			SYKES
		   (throw away)
	Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?
		   (to Harcourt)
	Listen, we just need a minute of
	your time...

			JETSON
	We'd like to ask you about a
	business associate of your, Warren
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	Yes, I heard about poor Warren.
	Tragic.

			SYKES
	You were partners with him on some
	Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate
	thing.

			HARCOURT
	That's right.  He and I, along with
	seven or eight others.  Listen,
	gentlemen, I will be happy to assist
	you in any way I can --
	unfortunately, at the moment, I'm
	overdue at another function.

Suddenly there's a voice from O.S.:

			MAYOR (O.S.)
	William...

Harcourt turns as the Mayor and his WIFE step up.

			HARCOURT
	Mr. Mayor...

			MAYOR
	William, I was wondering if you
	wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and
	me.  Two limousines trying to make
	it across town in all this traffic,
	we're bound to be later than we
	already are.

			HARCOURT
	Excellent idea.  Ray, I wonder if
	you know two of your police
	officers... Detective Jetson and
	Sykes.

			MAYOR
		   (shaking their hands,
		    dismissively)
	A pleasure.
		   (to Harcourt)
	We really should be going.

The wind is knocked from Sykes' sails by the presence of
the Mayor with a very impatient expression.  Harcourt
smiles.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	Please feel free to call my office
	Monday morning for an appointment.
		   (to Jetson)
	Congratulations again on your
	promotion, Detective.  Remember...
	you're out there setting an example
	in our community.  I'll be keeping
	an eye on you.

Harcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are
penetrating... telegraphing a subliminal warning.
Harcourt and entourage move off... leaving Sykes steaming.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - HARCOURT AND KIPLING - NIGHT

Walking behind the others.  They speak in very low voices;
Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs
during:

			KIPLING
	That cop, the human, he was the one
	who killed Anderson and the driver.

			HARCOURT
	This is becoming a serious breach of
	security.

			KIPLING
	He didn't recognize me.

			HARCOURT
	It is his new partner that I'm
	worried about.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  POLICE FIRING RANGE - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

MAFFET, the stocky retired cop behind the counter, hands
Jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets.
Sykes nods to Jetson, motioning him toward the firing
line.

			SYKES
	Go on ahead.  I'll be right in.
		   (to Maffet, low)
	What'd you dig up for me?

Maffet slides open a drawer, takes out a paper bag
containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore.  By
his manner this deal is definitely not kosher.  Sykes
hefts the weapon.

			MAFFET
	You said you wanted the biggest
	thing I could find... Well, this is
	it.

			SYKES
	What is it?

			MAFFET
	Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking
	twice the impact energy of .44
	Magnum hot loads.

			SYKES
		   (flips open cylinder)
	Only holds five.

			MAFFET
	Yeah, the shells are too big for six
	in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you
	don't need but one.

			SYKES
		   (sighting)
	No... two.


EXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - FIRING LINE - NIGHT

Jetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking
careful aim with his .38 as Sykes walks up.  Jetson slips
the protectors down.

			SYKES
	Well, let's see what you got,
	Cochise.  Gimme six, rapid fire.

Jetson, a little nervous at this command performance,
turns, sets, and FIRES at the silhouette target.  It's a
large, sloppy grouping.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	How long you been shooting?  That's
	pitiful.  Whattya gonna do if
	somebody draws down on you, wave
	your scores on the written exam at
	'em?

Sykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the
Casull.

			JETSON
	Why did you do it?

			SYKES
	Why'd I do what?

			JETSON
	Agree to work with me?  You don't
	like me... you don't like any of us.
	You have nothing but contempt for
	us.  And yet you become an outcast
	from your club of detectives by
	making me your partner...

			SYKES
	My partner is dead!  Because one of
	you bastards killed him -- then
	disappeared into a rathole down in
	Slagtown, where he's home and dry,
	'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody
	says nothing...

Sykes grabs a bullet-proof vest from nearby, slaps it onto
the hanging target form.  He hits the switch, running the
target down to the end of the lane.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	But he didn't figure on you, George.
	You're going to get me through that
	wall of silence.  You're going to
	make them talk to me.  You're going
	to help me find that Slag son-of-a-
	bitch.  Comprendo?  And if Fedorchuk
	and the boys in the bullpen don't
	like it, screw them... and if the
	Captain doesn't like it, screw
	him... and if all the Slags down in
	Slagtown don't like it... well screw
	them too!

Sykes raises the Casull, fires.  KA-BOOM!!!  The shell
rockets clean through the bullet-proof vest on the target
form.  The recoil slams Sykes back, jerks his arm up.  KA-
BOOM!!!  again, and another hole is drilled through the
vest.  Other shooters look over.  Sykes sets the gun
down... sees his hand is bleeding.  Jetson absorbs all
this, as we--

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

A violet neon "X" FILLS FRAME, flashing hypnotically.
It's a bar catering to rough-trade Newcomer clientele.
Several ALIEN MEN, brute laborer-types, lounge around out
front.  They glare with antagonism as Sykes and Jetson
climb out of their car.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Okay, just stay back and do what I
	do.  Watch and learn, watch and
	learn...


INT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson walk into the almost total blackness of
this all-Newcomer place.

A few near-infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness.

			SYKES
	I can't see dick in here.

We can dimly make out booths along one wall, some tables,
and the bar.  There are maybe twenty figures seated or
standing in the darkness.  The room falls silent in a wave
as Sykes' presence becomes noticed.

Sykes saunters forward, commanding the space with his
unhurried movements.

			SYKES
		   (calling into the
		    dark silence)
	Which one'a you Slags is Porter?

			VOICE
		   (from the back of
		    the bar)
	Who wants to know?

Sykes squints into the darkness, then--

			SYKES
		   (aside to Jetson)
	Who said that?

			JETSON
		   (tilts his head to
		    indicate)
	At the end of the bar.

Sykes nods, starts in that direction.

			SYKES
	My name is Sykes.  I'm--

			ALIEN VOICE
	Ss'ai k'ss?

The whole place roars with LAUGHTER.  Too late Sykes
remembers what his name sounds like to them.  He continues
down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his
leg out and trips Sykes with his size 16 work boot.  Sykes
stumbles, then recovers and pivots on the offender.  Hoots
and derisive LAUGHTER.  He sees only shadows.

			OFFENDER
		   (merely a voice in
		    the dark)
	Careful, ss'loka', you might hurt
	yourself.

More laughter.  Sykes gives the darkness where the
offender sits a hard stare, then turns and shoulders his
way to the end of the bar.  Jetson follows.  Sykes stops
behind a big Newcomer in greasy work clothes.

ANGLE

The punk Newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head
down, trying to be inconspicuous.

He glances over at the two cops... his expression shifting
to recognition as he spots Jetson.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes speaks to the Big Newcomer's back.

			SYKES
	You Porter?

The Big Newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk.
Doesn't turn.  Sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns
him around.  The alien grabs Sykes' hand off, rising to
his full height.  He and Sykes lock eyes.  Meanwhile.  the
punk Newcomer (PORTER) has started to slip away unnoticed.
Jetson spots him, reaches out with one arm, and grabs him
by the jacket.

			JETSON
	No, Matthew.  I believe this is the
	one you want.

He pulls Porter back into play.  Now Jetson sees Porter's
face... and he, too, reacts with recognition.

Sykes gives Jetson a sour look, releases the Big Newcomer,
and turns his malice on the punk Newcomer.

			SYKES
	Your name wouldn't happen to be
	Porter, would it?

			JETSON
	Uh, Matthew...

			SYKES
		   (over his shoulder
		    to Jetson)
	Back off, George.

			JETSON
	But I-- (know this man).

			SYKES
	I'll handle it.

Jetson backs off, letting him handle it.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	Jesus, are the questions too tough
	for you already?  Let's try again--
		   (slowly)
	Is your name Porter?

			PORTER
	Ss'kya'ta'.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What's that?

			JETSON
	Screw you.

			SYKES
		   (back to Porter)
	Screw me?  That can't be right.

			PORTER
	Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'.  Ss'trokya'
	ss'lato na'!

			JETSON
		   (to Sykes, low)
	You don't want to know.

			SYKES
	Tell me.

			JETSON
	Your mother mates out of season.

			SYKES
		   (to Porter)
	That's very colorful.  But see --
	now I've got a problem.  I don't
	seem to be getting much cooperation
	from you, Porter.  So I guess we're
	gonna have to take this little
	session down to my office, ya
	know?

And instantly Sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on
the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around
him.  Jetson gets a blast of it, too.  The aliens are
momentarily blinded.

Sykes has Porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his
face, as he starts to handcuff him.  But Porter gets a
hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight.
Darkness falls... along with Sykes' expression of
satisfaction.

Porter hurls Sykes back, slamming him into a table.  The
crowd HOOTS and CHEERS.  Sykes finds his way to his feet.

			JETSON
	Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this).

			SYKES
	Stay back!  I'm okay.

He charges Porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club.
The two of them battle, then Sykes sees his opportunity
and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin.
Porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises
again -- smiling.

			PORTER
	Don't they teach you anything about
	us in cop school, little ss'loka'?

Porter grabs Sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver
a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into FRAME, locking
with Porter's, blocking the punch.  It is Jetson.

			JETSON
	Enough.

			PORTER
		   (eyeing Jetson)
	Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.  You're a
	cop.
		   (with some contempt)
	It fits you.

Jetson says something to him in the alien language.
Porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back
exit.  Sykes stumbles over to Jetson.

			SYKES
	You know that guy?

			JETSON
		   (nods)
	From quarantine, when my people
	first arrived here.  He and I were
	housed together.

			SYKES
	How could a straight-arrow like you
	ever pick a roommate like him?

			JETSON
	In the camps, we were lodged four to
	a room.  The selection process was
	entirely random.  We did not get to
	stay with our friends... or
	families...

And he moves toward the back exit.  Sykes watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  "X" BAR - NIGHT

Porter leans against an alley wall.  He speaks English
learned on the streets.

			JETSON
	You don't know what your father and
	these two men were arguing about?

			PORTER
	I told you -- I was in the back of
	the store.  I just heard voices,
	muffled like.

			SYKES
	One of the two men was Hubley,
	right?  What about the other one?
	Did you know him?

			PORTER
	Yeah... I seen him around.  High-
	roller dude named Strader.  Joshua
	Strader.  Runs a club on the west
	side.  Encounters.

			SYKES
	Yeah, I heard of it.

			PORTER
	That's all I know.  You want
	anything more, you ask somebody
	else.

He pushes away from the wall, heads for the door to the
bar.

			JETSON
	I am sorry about your father.

Porter throws him a look over his shoulder, then
disappears through the door.  Sykes and Jetson start down
the alley.

			JETSON
	If I may make a suggestion... We
	have different weak spots than you
	do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve
	plexus under the arm, here, will
	produce the effect I think you were
	looking for.

			SYKES
	Yeah, sure.  I knew that...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

The wall-mounted menu is in English and the Alien
Language.  The SERVERS are teen aged humans and aliens.

Sykes and Jetson stand at the counter awaiting their
order.

			KID
		   (serving them)
	Six forty-two.

They both put money on the counter.  The kid goes to put
the order together.  Sykes looks at the alien characters
on the menu.

			SYKES
	I don't think I could ever learn to
	read that shit.
		   (beat)
	How long did it take you to learn
	English?

			JETSON
	Three months.
		   (off Sykes' look)
	We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is
	our strength... what we were bred
	for, to adapt to hostile
	environments.

The Serving Kid puts their bags on the counter.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	Thank you.

They take the bags and walk off, digging the food out of
the bags as they talk:

			SYKES
	My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer
	girl in his class.  She's six years
	old and in seventh grade already...

They climb into the car.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson doesn't respond... some things are better left
unaddressed.  Meanwhile, Sykes has unwrapped his food and
recoils in disgust.

			SYKES
	Oh, God.  I think I got yours
	here...

He holds up two strips of raw meat with patches of animal
fur still on them.  Jetson meanwhile is grimacing at the
dripping cheeseburger he's just unwrapped.  They quickly
trade.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Which one is that?  Raw what?

			JETSON
		   (eating a strip)
	This is mole.  It's good.

			SYKES
	I'll bet.
		   (winces, watching him
		    chew)
	Would it really put you out if they
	tossed that on the grill for a
	minute or two?

			JETSON
	Our bodies do not assimilate the
	nutrients if the food has been
	cooked.

Jetson looks over at him, smiling.

			SYKES
	Oh, that's real attractive.  You got
	fur in your teeth, George.  Come on,
	man, we're gonna be talking to
	people... jeez.

Sykes looks at his burger, his appetite gone, shoves it
back into the sack and tosses it into the back seat.


INT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Sykes pulls onto the street.

			SYKES
	So what was that other word for
	Human... Slow ka?

			JETSON
	Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small
	but intelligent creature".
		   (Sykes looks over,
		    doesn't know if he
		    likes this)
	It loses much in the translation.

			SYKES
	And what was that one about my
	mother?  That was a good one.

			JETSON
	Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.

Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along
haltingly.  After several tries, he can say it passably
well.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

An upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club.  The
antithesis of the "X" bar.  A human HOSTESS in a slit
dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a
table.  She moves off.  The two cops look up at the stage.

REVERSE ANGLE

revealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA.  She
moves with a feline blend of strength and grace.  Framing
her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a
mane as she undulates to the MUSIC.

Sykes watches with fascination.  The MUSIC ends and
Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a
human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up.  Sykes and Jetson
quickly intercept her as she heads backstage.

			JETSON
	You are Cassandra?

			CASSANDRA
	That's right.

			JETSON
	We are with the Police Department.
	This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--

			CASSANDRA
		   (laughing)
	Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.

			SYKES
	We're looking for your boss --
	Strader.

She eyes the two of them warily, then moves backstage,
assuming they will follow.


INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

She moves along the narrow corridor.

			CASSANDRA
	He's not here.  Why ask me?

			JETSON
	The young woman at the front said
	you might know where he is.

			CASSANDRA
	She did, did she?  Well, she was
	wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.

			SYKES
	No problem.

She moves through a door.  Sykes follows closely so does
Jetson.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall.

			SYKES
	Look, we're not here doing an
	interview for the school paper.
	This is a homicide investigation...
	and if you don't stop jerkin' us
	around, I'm ready to start playin'
	hardball.

Jetson has waited politely half-in half-out of the room.
Sykes rapidly motions to him to "go look around".  Jetson
mimes back, "Huh?"

			CASSANDRA
		   (slipping out of her
		    dance costume)
	Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds
	interesting.  Are you going to
	strike me?  You could tie me up and
	then do whatever you want with me...
	I've got my own ropes.

			SYKES
		   (still miming to
		    Jetson)
	Does that cost extra or you throw
	them in?

			CASSANDRA
	You've got me all wrong.  I don't
	charge money for something that I
	myself find pleasurable...

Finally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him.  He
says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar:

			JETSON
	I am going out to the car.  I will
	meet you there.

Sykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor.
Cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish,
low-cut dress.

			CASSANDRA
	Look, I don't know where Mr.
	Strader might be.  He comes and he
	goes.

			SYKES
		   (starting to feel a
		    little uncomfortable)
	The girl out front mentioned
	Strader's assistant, somebody named
	Watson.  Maybe he knows.

			CASSANDRA
		   (tensing slightly)
	Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.

She is very close to Sykes now.  She fingers the lapel of
his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
		   (continuing)
	I know... Why don't you hang around
	for a while, let me entertain you?
	It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the
	truth, have you ever... made it...
	with one of us?

			SYKES
	Not unless I got real drunk and
	nobody told me about it later.

			CASSANDRA
	A virgin.  I find that very
	arousing...


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

MUSIC drifts up from downstairs.  Jetson moves along the
corridor, scoping things out.  He tries a door.  Locked.
Tries another one.  Open.  He eases it wider, then enters
the darkened office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the office.  Looks around.  Makes his
way to the cluttered desk top.  Pushes things around...
all the usual stuff.  He starts to turn away, then his eye
catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger
books.  He reaches for it.  A small dispenser -- of the
kind we saw being filled at the refinery.  Jetson studies
it, his suspicions growing.  Opening it, he finds only the
barest trace of a viscous substance.

He smells it... not enough to tell for certain what it is.
But enough that he is very concerned about what it could
be.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now.
She takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her
facial ridges.  She shudders with pleasure.  Sykes begins
to perspire.

			SYKES
	There's lots of things I haven't
	done, but his ain't high on the
	list.  Don't take it personally.

			CASSANDRA
	I think you're just a little scared
	now, about what you might find once
	the lights go out.  A little
	scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe
	more than you want to admit.  But
	doesn't that turn you on, that
	curiosity and fear, swirling
	together?
		   (coos)
	Think of it as broadening your
	horizons.

			SYKES
	I like my horizons narrow.

			CASSANDRA
		   (pressing herself
		    into him)
	Your voice is saying no, but your
	body is saying yes.

He quickly disengages from her.

			SYKES
	My voice, body, and everything else
	is saying I'll be back in two hours
	for Strader, and he better damn well
	be here.

He shoves a business card at her, then retreats through
the door.


INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes closes the door and lets out his breath.


INT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cassandra's expression instantly turns to worry and she
quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom
button.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson, looking through a desk drawer, hears the intercom
BUZZ in the next room.  Through the wall--

			WATSON (O.S.)
		   (tentatively)
	Yes...?

			CASSANDRA (O.S.)
		   (over the intercom,
		    breathless)
	Todd, it's me.  The police were just
	here... looking for Strader.  And
	asking about you.

Jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office,
drawing his gun.  The floor squeaks beneath his feet.  He
looks down, then continues toward the door.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

Jetson eases open the door.  It's the manager's private
office.  Jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the
desk, the desk lamp on, a lit cigarette in an ashtray --
but no one behind the desk.  Jetson eases through the door
and--

-- a chair crashes down on him from behind the door!
Jetson goes down, his gun skittering out of his hand.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Jetson and his assailant battle in the well-appointed
office.


INT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sykes hears the fight through the private office door.
He throws the door open.


INT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes stands in the doorway, the Casull straight-armed at
Jetson's assailant.

			SYKES
	Freeze!  Now!

The assailant does.  He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing
hard.  He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit.  This is
TODD WATSON.  Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise.

Suddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking
him sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson
seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into
some furniture and dives for the door.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Watson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape.
Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra.  She's as strong
as he is, but he has the edge in experience.

Jetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway,
ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went.

			SYKES
		   (struggling with
		    Cassandra)
	Fire escape!  End of the hall!

Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges to
get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff
around a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at
him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and
charges down the corridor.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Jetson pounds down the fire escape.  Below him, he sees
Watson reach the ground and take off running for the
parking area.

Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting
down other rows trying to make up the distance between
them.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen
feet to the ground.


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires
it up.  Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls
his gun, aims.

The white reverse-lights flash on.  Jetson stands there,
gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.  In that split
second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to
avoid being hit.


INT.  ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT

Watson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes
standing right in front of the car.  He hits the gas.
Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car.
Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass,
panics and--


EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars.

Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car.

Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his
arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct
hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.  Watson
folds over with a "ooowwph" sound and drops to his knees.

			SYKES
		   (breathing hard)
	I'll be damned.  It worked.
		   (sees Jetson run up)
	How'd you like that, huh?  Whammo!
	Both barrels.  Dropped him like a
	bag of cement.

Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.  He looks at the
I.D.

			SYKES
	Who is he?

			JETSON
	Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.

Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one
agonized breath.

			WATSON
	I don't believe this.  Look at my
	suit.  Look at what you made me do
	to my car.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Your girlfriend put up a better
	fight than you did, pal.

			JETSON
	We are looking for your employer,
	Joshua Strader.

			WATSON
	He's out of town.

			JETSON
	Why did you run?

			WATSON
	Because you two were chasing me.

			SYKES
	We were chasing you because you ran,
	you dumb son-of-a-bitch.

			JETSON
	When will Strader return?

			WATSON
	Who knows.  He's the boss -- he
	doesn't have to check in with me.

			SYKES
		   (wearily)
	Watson... this is my partner here's
	first coupla days, and he wants to
	make a good impression.  Me, though,
	the way I feel -- this could be my
	last day, know what I mean?  And I'm
	ready to rain on you like a cow
	pissin' on a flat rock.

			WATSON
	Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been
	around for a coupla days.  He didn't
	tell me where he was going or when
	he'd be back.  I swear it.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	What do you think?

			JETSON
	I believe he is probably lying.

			SYKES
	Through his ass.
		   (to Watson)
	Next time you see him, tell him to
	call me... unless you want us to
	keep coming back on you like a bad
	case of herpes.

Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket.
They walk away and Watson slumps against his car.

ANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON

as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	George, you can handle the women
	from now on, you mind?

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he
hears footsteps.  He turns with a "What now?" expression
and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.  He
goes down.  Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN
THUGS.  One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's
employ.

			QUINT
		   (to other Thugs)
	Okay, scrape him up.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT

Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access
road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs.
The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d.
van.

Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back
of the van.  Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three
human Thugs.

They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing
the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron.
He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.

			HARCOURT
	Any progress?

			QUINT
	My arm's gettin' tired and so far,
	zip.

			KIPLING
	He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to
	Strader.

			QUINT
	What's that mean?

			KIPLING
	Duty-bonded.  His allegiance to
	Strader is above pain or life.

			QUINT
	You tellin' me this guy would die
	before he'd screw his boss and work
	for us?  Nobody's that dumb.

			KIPLING
	It is something you couldn't
	comprehend, Quint.

Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to
keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.

			HARCOURT
	I understand you have been resisting
	my offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of
	duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --
	no longer an issue, I'm afraid...

Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from
the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot
twice through the front of his silk suit.  Watson's eyes
widen in fear.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	I will not make this offer again.  I
	want you to work for me, to manage
	the nightclub as Strader's successor.
	If you do, you will know a wealth
	and comfort our people never dared
	imagine...

Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant.

			WATSON
	Sss'k'a ta'!

Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring
his resolve.  Then--

			HARCOURT
	It is such a pity to die for an
	outmoded value.
		   (rising)
	Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for
	our friend's swimming lesson.

Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.

			HARCOURT
		   (to Watson)
	It's important to learn new skills.
	Essential to your growth as a
	person.

Quint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper.  He bucks
and lunges as they drag him toward the surf.  Quint
addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy.

			QUINT
	You never seen this before, have
	you, Billy?  oh, man, you ain't
	gonna believe it... seawater is like
	battery acid to these guys... I
	don't know what it is, some kinds
	chemical reaction.  Whatta you think
	it is, Watson?  Whoa, hold him.
		   (a wave breaks
		    outside, the foam
		    rolls in)
	What I love about the surf is you
	can never tell how far up it's going
	to come until it... whoops, got a
	little wet there.

The wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs.  He
screams.  Flailing, one of his hands dips below the
surface of the water.  He howls and yanks out his hand.
We see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand
droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the
hand.  The Thugs get Watson swinging.

			QUINT
	Last call, sucker.  One... two...
	THREE!

Watson is flung into the surf.

ANGLE

Harcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the
waterline.  We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then
nothing.  Kipling is very nervous this close to the water.
Harcourt seems unperturbed.

			KIPLING
	When we picked him up, he was
	talking to those two cops -- the two
	who came to question you about
	Hubley.

			HARCOURT
	This is getting out of hand.  I want
	you to deal with it.  Immediately.

A wave rushes up the sand.  Kipling quickly steps back.
Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops
six inches from his dress shoes.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing)
	We must learn to embrace the things
	we fear... and from that grow
	strong.

A moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo.
He motions to Strader's body and the surf.  The Thugs grab
the body and heave it into the waves.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the
kitchen wall phone.  Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle
of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a
glass, pours himself a shot.  As Jetson is talking, he
spots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out
of the refrigerator two nights ago.

He sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement.
He finishes with his wife and hangs up.  He watches Sykes
take a long pull on the vodka.

			JETSON
		   (holds up milk
		    carton)
	Would you mind?

Sykes shrugs, tosses him a glass.  Jetson pours the semi-
lumpy milk and takes a big swallow.  Sykes grimaces.
Then--

			SYKES
		   (indicates phone)
	So, she keeps you on a pretty short
	leash, does she?

			JETSON
	My wife?  She worries about me.

Sykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his
voice more weary then bitter.

			SYKES
	Yeah... I know the routine.

			JETSON
	You are married?

			SYKES
	Was.  Divorced.

			JETSON
	We mate for life.  Divorce... is a
	strange concept to us.

			SYKES
	It's like having an eleventh finger
	removed.  It hurts like hell, but
	you never really needed the damn
	thing in the first place.

Jetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand
this.  They drink... Jetson gazes around.

			JETSON
	Your home is quite disordered.  I
	thought perhaps you had been
	burglarized when I walked in.

			SYKES
		   (growling)
	I appreciate your honesty, George.

He smacks his glass against Jetson's.  They drink.


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

Sykes has his wallet out... showing Jetson a dog-eared
photo.

			SYKES
	Ignore the bitch on the left, that's
	Edie.  I call her Edi Amin... This
	is Kristin, my daughter.  It's kinda
	an old picture... she's twenty now.
	Getting married, in fact... on
	Sunday.

Jetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the
proffered photo.  They're both a little drunk now.

			JETSON
	Human children can be very
	beautiful.
		   (then)
	Getting married?  Congratulations.
	You will be taking Sunday off,
	then...

			SYKES
		   (uneasy)
	Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not
	sure I'm gonna go.
		   (mumbles)
	She doesn't need her burn-out of a
	father there...

Jetson looks at him.  Sees something he never thought
possible in Sykes.  Vulnerability.  Trying to break the
melancholy mood, Jetson reaches for his wallet.

			JETSON
		   (upbeat)
	I must show you...
		   (flips open wallet,
		    shows four crisp
		    photos of his wife)
	And this is Richard.  My son.  He's
	four years old.  We named him after
	the former President, Richard Nixon.

Sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table...
and has to laugh.  He looks up at Jetson's sincere face.
He may be starting to like this guy.

			SYKES
	You open to a piece of advice?  Tell
	people you named him after Richard
	Burton, the actor.  Just take my
	word for it.

And he clacks his glass against Jetson's sitting on the
table, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER

They are quite a bit drunker.  Jetson has doffed his
jacket and tie, leans in, listening intently to Sykes.

			SYKES
	... and so, and so the doctor says,
	"If this is the thermometer, then
	where'd I leave the pen?"
		   (laughs raucously,
		    Jetson doesn't
		    react)
	You're not... you don't think that's
	funny?  George, work with me, I
	always get a laugh with that one.
	Look, if the doctor's got the
	thermometer in his hand, then
	where's his pen gotta be?

			JETSON
		   (straight-faced)
	In the other man's rectum.

			SYKES
		   (laughing)
	Sticking out of his ass... yeah!
	See, that's what makes it a joke.
	There's like a surprise, and your
	mind fills in the funny picture.
	Here's this guy with a pen stuck in
	his ass and he thinks it's a
	thermometer.
		   (Jetson just blinks)
	Nada, huh?

Jetson shrugs apologetically.  Sykes pours them each
another round.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Your health...

			JETSON
	Ta ss'trakyona'...

They CLACK glasses, and--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER STILL

The party has moves into the living room floor, around the
coffee table.  It's a quieter moment.

			JETSON
	There is so much our two peoples
	don't understand about each other.

			SYKES
	No shit, Holmes.  You're only from
	another goddamn planet, for
	chrissakes.

			JETSON
	You humans are very curious to us.
	You invite us to live among you, in
	an atmosphere of equality we've
	never known before.  You lay before
	us a beautiful green world, full of
	freedoms and opportunities... You
	give us ownership of our lives for
	the first time... and you ask no
	more of us than you do of
	yourselves: to live by the rules...
	rules that aren't made to keep one
	people subordinate to another, but
	rules that exist to preserve
	equality.  You aspire to very high
	ideals here.

Sykes is watching Jetson, mesmerized.  The guy's never
said this much at one time before.

If he wasn't drunk, Jetson would never let himself open up
to a human like this.

			JETSON
		   (continuing)
	I hope you can understand how
	special your world is... how unique
	a people you humans are.  So it us
	all the more painful and confusing
	to us that so few of you seem
	capable of living up the the ideals
	you set for yourselves.

			SYKES
	Don't count on me, George.  I never
	had any ideals.

Jetson smiles a little.  He knows that's bullshit.

			JETSON
	We don't understand the hatred, the
	contempt.  But we must bear it... we
	must not react in anger... because
	our situation here is still fragile.
	The separationists would see us
	returned to the quarantine camps.
	The fundamentalists say we have no
	more human rights than dogs or cats.
	But the prejudice we face here is so
	insignificant compared to the pain
	that we've known before.  And that
	is why we are so grateful.

Sykes studies him a long time through heavy-lidded eyes.
Finally--

			SYKES
	Yeah, well... except I did hear you
	eat your dead.

Jetson looks at him a long beat, then--

			JETSON
		   (deadpan)
	Only on Fridays.

Sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then
explodes with laughter.

			SYKES
	You son-of-a-bitch.  You're okay.

Jetson stands unsteadily, and announces:

			JETSON
	I'm going home.

			SYKES
	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You
	do sleep, don't you?

Jetson, going out the front door, just waves over his
shoulder without turning around.  He's gone.

			SYKES
	What a wildman...

Sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward
onto the sofa, unconscious.  And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO--


INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN

The first hues of dawn stream through the window.  Sykes
remains passed out on the sofa where we left him.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

The slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the
RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this
street at the corner.

The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug-
mobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights
carrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint.

Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then
slides behind the wheel.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN

Quint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a
packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and
two lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down,
starts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears
from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the
seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back
seat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He
sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy.

Under the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works.
Mistake.

Jetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees
this guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his
brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the
face with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his
face.  That was the last thing he needed.


EXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN

Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car.
He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck.

It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as
Jetson stumbles out of the car.  He whips out his gun from
the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand.
Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien
phrase, clearly the equivalent of "Fuck it...".

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY

Sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left
him.  Someone is POUNDING on the door.  He regains
consciousness reluctantly.

			SYKES
	This better be good news or money.

He shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting
Jetson.  Jetson holds the C-4 charge in a handkerchief
with one hand and gives it to Sykes.

			JETSON
	Hold this.
		   (lurching to the
		    sink)
	I feel very terrible.

Sykes registers what he's holding.  He moves to Jetson,
who is running his head under the tap.

			SYKES
	Where'd you get this?!!

			JETSON
	A man, a human, was wiring it to
	your car.  I didn't get a good look
	at him.
		   (then, registering
		    that it's day;
		    panicked)
	I must call my wife...

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PRECINCT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

Jetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing
rumpled and a day old.  Sykes has showered and changed so
he's not suffering as much by comparison.  They approach
Sykes' desk.

			JETSON
	She's going to divorce me.

			SYKES
	George, she's not gonna divorce you.
	You mate for life, remember?

			JETSON
	She's very progressive.  I'm certain
	she's considering it.

ANGLE - A UNIFORMED SECRETARY

distributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes.

			SECRETARY
	You guys are looking for somebody
	named Strader, right?

			SYKES
	Yeah.

			SECRETARY
	Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned
	in.  They found him.
		   (Sykes and Jetson
		    react)
	Or at least what's left of him,
	washed up on the beach at Zuma.

Sykes and Jetson react again.

			SECRETARY
		   (continuing; handing
		    over  the message
		    slip)
	They're still there if you wanna
	catch them.

She moves off.

			SYKES
	Well, let's roll, George.

			JETSON
		   (with a stricken
		    expression)
	To the... to the beach?

			SYKES
	Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - ZUMA BEACH - DUSK

CRANE SHOT, nice and WIDE, showing the slug-mobile turning
off P.C.H. onto a gravel road which curves down the the
beach.  The following is V.O. as the car approaches the
water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Why?

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Please, I must get out here.

			SYKES (V.O.)
	Come on, you won't have to get near
	the water.

			JETSON (V.O.)
	Stop the car!

We see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

			SYKES
	All right, okay.  Keep your
	pantyhose on.  Jeez, when in doubt,
	freak out, for chrissake.

Sykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen
of sweat, his hands shaking.  Sykes softens.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	It's all right, George.  It's cool.
	Just wait here, all right?  I'll be
	back in a coupla minutes.

			JETSON
	Thank you.

He climbs out and Sykes drives down to the beach... toward
a cluster of vehicles: a Sheriff's black-and-white, a
coroner's wagon, and Fedorchuk's unmarked sedan.


EXT.  BEACH - DUSK

A quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a
person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk
suit.  Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and
other high tide detritus.

ANGLE ON SYKES, FEDORCHUK, AND ALTEREZ

looking down at the body.  A CORONER'S TECHNICIAN is doing
a closer inspection.

			FEDORCHUK
	Found his wallet in his jacket
	pocket.  Joshua Strader, big as
	life.

			CORONER'S TECH
	Jesus, what a mess.  It's gonna be a
	bear to make a positive
	determination, but it looks to me
	like he was shot before being tossed
	in the drink.  At least twice--
		   (indicates where
		    hearts  would've
		    been on the body)
	-- here, and here.

Sykes absorbs this.  He rises along with Fedorchuk and
Alterez.

			SYKES
	How're you two doing on Tuggle's
	killer?

			ALTEREZ
	The store owner's son is in a street
	gang, so now we're thinking maybe
	it's gang related.

			SYKES
	Yeah, that's real good.  You guys
	follow up on that for a coupla
	months.

Fedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above.

			FEDORCHUK
	Look at your dildo partner.  He's
	too scared to even come down to the
	sand.
		   (calls up to Jetson,
		    even though he's too
		    far away to hear)
	You're not gonna get wet standing
	here, moron!

			SYKES
	I'd like to see you next to a sea of
	hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see
	how much surfin' you'd do.

Alterez shoots a polaroid of the body.  Sykes grabs it as
it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car.
Fedorchuk flips him the bird.  As Sykes rounds the car, he
sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid
chalk marker a big star with "E.T. P.D." printed inside
it.  Sykes looks around.  Fedorchuk and the others stand
together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his
direction.

			SYKES
	Cute.


EXT.  BEACH ROAD - DUSK

Sykes has stopped to pick Jetson up.

He's wiping the "E.T. P.D."  from the door as Jetson
approaches from the edge of the bluff.  Fedorchuk pulls up
alongside in his n.d. sedan.  He calls off to Jetson, who
is still twenty yards away.

			FEDORCHUK
	Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.
	Forget you hip waders, big guy?

			SYKES
	Lay off, asshole.

			FEDORCHUK
	I may be an asshole, but at least
	I'm a real detective, not some outer
	shit space thing.

Sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be
highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans
against it.

			SYKES
	Yeah?  you're a real honest-to-god
	detective...?

Sykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into
the steering wheel, BAM-HONK!, and in doing so, has hurt
his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with).

He shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing
Fedorchuk's car keys with the other.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	Then detect these!

Fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car
keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff.  Jetson, just
climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this
scene without knowing how it began.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK

Sykes gets in, slams the door.  His hand hurts as he grabs
the wheel.  He holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the
car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward P.C.H.
Jetson looks over, curious.

			JETSON
	What was that about?

			SYKES
		   (embarrassed that he
		    defended Jetson)
	Nothing.

On Jetson's confused expression, we--

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  BURGER STAND - NIGHT

A different burger stand.  Sykes and Jetson sit across
from each other at one of the outdoor tables... Sykes with
his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips.  This time
they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they
talk.

			SYKES
	... So we've got three guys dead.
	All Newcomers, all killed the same
	way -- execution style.

			JETSON
	Warren Hubley was in middle
	management at a refinery... Joshua
	Strader operated a successful bar
	and nightclub...

			SYKES
	... and Porter ran a piece of shit
	mom-and-pop mini-mart.
		   (beat)
	So what the hell's the connection?

				    CUT TO:

INT.  PATHOLOGY LAB OFFICE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson enter the cluttered lab office.  Winter
is here eating take-out chicken at his cluttered desk.

			SYKES
	You guys finished the postmortem on
	Strader yet?

			WINTER
		   (his mouth full)
	You mean the Blob?  They're
	finishing up now.

			JETSON
	Is Bentner here?  I must speak with
	him.

			WINTER
	He went home early -- his kid was
	sick.

Jetson frowns.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Yeah, but he left something for you.

He wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an
envelope on the desk and hands it to Jetson.  Jetson tears
open the sealed envelope.  The message inside is written
in the alien language.

			WINTER
		   (continuing)
	Does this have something to do with
	the test he ran that he wouldn't
	tell me about?

CLOSE ON - JETSON

His expression grows stricken as he reads the message.

BACK TO SCENE

			SYKES
		   (getting very curious
		    and suspicious now)
	What kind of test?

			WINTER
	Looking for some foreign compound in
	the blood of that alien you dropped
	the other day.

			SYKES
	Did he find anything?

Winter shrugs, indicates the message Jetson reads, as if
to say, "Maybe it says in there".

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Well?

Jetson refolds the paper and puts it in his pocket.

He is clearly disturbed by what he has read.  He looks at
Sykes a moment, then quickly breaks eye contact.

			JETSON
	It is nothing.

Jetson quickly moves off.  Sykes hurries off after him.


INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sykes hurries to catch up with the fast walking Jetson.
They eventually reach the elevators and Jetson jabs the
button during:

			SYKES
	What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't
	nothing yesterday when you asked
	Bentner to run that test and he
	looked like he was about to shit
	peach pits, and it's not nothing
	now.  Don't lie to me, George,
	you're bad at it.

			JETSON
		   (distant, closed)
	You must leave me alone on this.

The elevator arrives, he steps in.  Sykes follows.


INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT

They enter the empty elevator.  Jetson presses the button
to descend.

			SYKES
	No, see, I don't leave you alone...
	I'm your partner.  I don't work that
	way... Tug didn't work that way.

Jetson remains steadfast.  Sykes, about to explode, slams
his palm against the red Emergency Stop button and the
elevator lurches to a halt between floors.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	No secrets, goddammit!  You don't
	hold back from me.  Whatever is
	going on, you're gonna tell me now!

			JETSON
		   (agonizing)
	No.  I cannot involve you.  This is
	not your concern.

			SYKES
	The hell it isn't, when somebody
	wires up enough C-4 explosive to my
	car to turn me into pink mist!
		   (beat)
	That Slag was on something, and not
	sour milk, either?  Am I right?
		   (he has backed Jetson
		    to the wall by sheer
		    force of will)
	TELL ME!  What is it?

			JETSON
		   (finally)
	... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us
	it is a potent narcotic.

			SYKES
	How potent?

			JETSON
	Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The
	"high" lasts several hours.  We
	would receive small amounts of it...
	as a reward for our labor.

			SYKES
	We?  You've taken it?

			JETSON
	We all did.

			SYKES
	Where did he get it?  Was there any
	of it on the ship?

			JETSON
	No... I am sure not.  That is why I
	am so concerned... someone must now
	be producing it here.
		   (emphatically)
	But none of my people know how to
	make it.  The process was carefully
	guarded.

			SYKES
		   (as the enormity
		    sinks in)
	Jesus, this is major.
		   (then)
	Why didn't you tell me sooner?
	Why'd you hold out on me?

			JETSON
	Your people don't know about this
	part of out past.  And they can't
	know -- It would threaten our entire
	existence here.

The voltage runs out of Sykes.  He seems to understand
Jetson's dilemma.

			SYKES
	George... look me in the eye...
	George, you don't ever lie to me
	again.

			JETSON
	I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot
	stop this without you.

Sykes stare at Jetson... absorbing the enormity of the
earth-shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move quickly to the slug-mobile.  Sykes
reaches for the driver's door handle with his punching
hand.  He winces in pain... the son-of-a-bitch still
hurts.  He looks across at Jetson opening the passenger
door.

			SYKES
	George?  How about you drive...

Jetson looks over at him... gently reacting to this vote
of confidence.  They walk quickly around to the opposite
doors, climb in.


INT.  CORRIDOR - BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

Sykes and Jetson move down this government-building
corridor.

			SYKES
	There's gotta be some other
	connection.

They enter a door marked BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS.


INT.  BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT

HIGH SHOT showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling
this huge room.  It's all but deserted.  Sykes and Jetson
are off to one side with a heavyset woman (human) COMPUTER
OPERATOR, who they're shanghaied into helping them after
hours.

CLOSER - AT COMPUTER OPERATOR'S DESK

She sits at her computer terminal.  Sykes and Jetson stand
behind her as she types in commands and information.

She types: Hubley, Warren.  The computer screen flashes
past various information, then settles on a screen full of
information of HUBLEY, WARREN.

			OPERATOR
	Here's Hubley.
		   (scanning it)
	Left Quarantine on November
	thirtieth, relocated first to
	Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles
	early in February the following
	year.  Field of expertise: chemical
	manufacturing.  Looks like he passed
	up several other better paying jobs
	waiting for that one at the
	refinery.

			SYKES
	Try Joshua Strader, will ya,
	darlin'?

			OPERATOR
	For you, anything.

The Operator punches up STRADER, JOSHUA.  The screen fills
with information.

			OPERATOR
		   (continuing, reading
		    from screen)
	Released on November twenty-ninth.
	Came immediately to L.A.  Ten weeks
	after arriving he took over the
	abandoned club which is now
	Encounters.

			JETSON
		   (to Operator)
	Now the store owner, please.  Cecil
	Porter.

She types it in.

			OPERATOR
	Released December one.  He and his
	wife moved first to Modesto, then
	Coalinga, California -- wherever
	that is -- settled in L.A. in
	April.  Field of expertise:
	organic chemical engineering.  He
	and his wife have one child, a son.

			SYKES
	Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful
	boy... close personal friend of
	George's here.

			OPERATOR
	I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems
	to be matching up...

But Sykes wasn't listening.  He's starting off... an idea
forming.  He stands there a moment, considering it, his
face looking like he's chewing something sour.  It's so
off-the-wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it.
Then--

			SYKES
	Holy shit...
		   (to Jetson)
	Look what we're staring at: three
	Newcomers with nothing in common,
	right?  What if it's just one other
	guy who killed these three?
		   (Jetson looks at him
		    blankly)
	Three and one make four.  Four
	Newcomers... of totally different
	backgrounds...
		   (Jetson still doesn't
		    get it)
	You and the store owner's son --
	that punker!

Suddenly the realization hits Jetson, too.  He looks at
Sykes.

			JETSON
	... Quarantine.

Sykes spins to the Operator, excited.

			SYKES
	Can you dig up their Quarantine
	records in this thing?

			OPERATOR
	Sure.  Just a minute.

She moves up a screen to the top of Porter's information. 

			OPERATOR
		   (to herself)
	Porter was in Lodge seven seven two.

She rapidly types in additional information.  The screen
shifts as she jumps files.  Finally she gets a line that
reads: ENTER LODGE NUMBER: She types: 7-7-2.

Sykes and Jetson lean in as the screen goes blank... then
information flashes past as the computer searches... then,
finally: Occupants, Quarantine Lodge 772: HUBLEY,
WARREN......... STRADER, JOSHUA.........

Sykes and Jetson react -- their hunch is coming true.

On the computer screen: .........PORTER, CECIL.........

Sykes and Jetson, their faces bathed in the green kick of
the screen, stare without blinking, waiting for that forth
name.

On the computer screen: .........HARCOURT, WILLIAM.

CLOSE ON - SYKES AND JETSON

reacting to the name.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

CLOSE on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure
rises from the back seat.  We TILT UP to reveal William
Harcourt.

We MOVE with him as he walks to the n.d. van (from the
beach scene) parked in front of the limousine.  Kipling is
just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab.  Quint
exits the driver door.  Kipling slides open the van's side
panel, reaches in for--

-- a large black suitcase.  He slides it out.  Harcourt
nods.  He and Kipling start into the club, followed by
Quint.


INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

The club is deserted tonight as Harcourt and entourage
move toward the back.


EXT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second
floor.  Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top
of the stairs waiting for them.  She's very uncomfortable
dealing with Harcourt.  Kipling and Quint continue on
toward the office door.  Harcourt pauses with Cassandra.
He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers
linger against her flesh.

			HARCOURT
	Quite lovely...
		   (best)
	What is your name again?

			CASSANDRA
		   (flinching
		    involuntarily at
		    his touch)
	Cassandra.

			HARCOURT
		   (a chilling smile)
	I will have to remember that...

He continues down toward the office door.  Cassandra
watches him go.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - MOVING - NIGHT

			JETSON
	They had months in quarantine to
	develop the plan.  Porter, with his
	chemistry background, must have
	somehow come up with the formula for
	the drug.  Hubley manufactured it --
	at the refinery.  Strader, through
	the nightclub, established a
	distribution network.  And
	Harcourt--

			SYKES
	Harcourt was the brain who brought
	it all together.


EXT.  REFINERY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT


EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

The slug-mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock
entrance.  Sykes and Jetson climb out.  They hop up onto
the loading platform and move purposefully into the well-
lit interior through the open door.


INT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

It is Saturday night, the plant is barely operational --
only a few WORKERS around.  Sykes and Jetson move
purposefully toward the back.

			SYKES
	Okay, George -- we gotta play this
	real smart.

			JETSON
	If the drug is here, we must destroy
	it.

			SYKES
	No, George -- you're missing the
	point.  The drug is evidence.  We
	need to have the evidence, ya know?

Jetson doesn't reply -- he's focused beyond what Sykes is
saying.  Sykes spots O'Neal up ahead by the refrigeration
door to the METHANE SECTION.

			SYKES
		   (continuing)
	That's the guy...

O'Neal recognizes Sykes and doesn't wait around for the
big Newcomer bearing down on him.  He dodges quickly
through the refrigeration door and swings it closed.
Jetson's hand hits the door an instant later, before it is
latched, and he pushes it open despite O'Neal's body
weight against the other side.


INT.  METHANE ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson grabs O'Neal by the collar and drags him deeper
into the deserted room.

			O'NEAL
	Hey, what are you, crazy?!  You
	can't come in here like this!  Hey!

Sykes reaches the doorway, stops and stares.

			SYKES
	So much for playing it smart...

O'Neal's feet are barely touching the ground as Jetson
moves along the row of drug-manufacturing equipment.

Finally he reaches a stainless steel tub... he runs a long
finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the
drug.  It glistens blue on his finger.  It holds him
mesmerized for several moments... his expression that of a
former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so.

			SYKES
		   (tentatively
		    stepping closer)
	Is that it...?

A beat, than Jetson explodes -- he sweeps a rack of
equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from
his hand onto O'Neal's shirt-front as he slams and pins
the bug-eyed O'Neal to the wall.

			SYKES
	Uh, George...

			JETSON
		   (in O'Neal's face)
	Where is the drug?  Where have they
	taken it?

			O'NEAL
		   (choking)
	What drug?  This is an oil refinery,
	you...

			JETSON
		   (pushing harder)
	WHERE?!

			O'NEAL
		   (unable to breathe)
	You... can't do... this!

			SYKES
	George, uh... you're gonna break his
	little chest bones...

			JETSON
	Stay out of this, Matthew.
		   (to O'Neal)
	Tell me where the drug has been
	taken or I will crush your lungs
	against this wall.

O'Neal is experiencing real fear now.  Sykes has decided
to back Jetson up, for better or worse.  He takes the
"good cop" role.

			SYKES
	Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he
	gets like this, I can't control him.
	I've seen this before.  He got like
	this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's
	spine out and show it to him.
	Nothing I could do.  I hadda go
	throw up.

			O'NEAL
		   (at length, with
		    great effort)
	... They took the stuff out, all of
	it -- this afternoon.

			JETSON
	How much?

			O'NEAL
	About fifty kilos... of
	concentrate... and some street
	grade... in tubes.

Jetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure.
O'Neal is really in bad trouble now.  Even Sykes takes a
half-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush
this man.

			JETSON
	Where have they taken it?

			O'NEAL
	Encount... Encounters Club.

Finally, Jetson eases off.  O'Neal slumps to the floor,
gasping for air.

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT

This time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set
and hard... as he strides to the car.  Sykes practically
has to run to keep up.

			SYKES
	George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's
	a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it
	-- we got him by the short hairs.
	He ain't gonna make any more of the
	shit.

			JETSON
	The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to
	find it.  I can't let it get out on
	the street.

			SYKES
	Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?

Jetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile,
yanks it open.

			SYKES
		   (continuing; as
		    Jetson starts the
		    car
	You destroy that drug, you destroy
	the case.  Don't blow the whole
	thing now by not following
	procedure.

			JETSON
		   (through the open
		    driver's window)
	Fuck procedure.

And to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels
out.

			SYKES
	Hey!!

Jetson accelerates toward the security gate.  The guard in
the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile
bashes through the barricade bar.

			SYKES
	GEORGE!  GODDAMMIT!!

Sykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no
car.  A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off
his shift starts ambling past.  Sykes runs in front of it,
waving his badge.  The pickup skids to a stop.

			SYKES
	Police.  Get out.  I need this
	thing.  Out, now!

The poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into
gear.  The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have
much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other
traffic.  He takes a hand off the wheel, reaches over and
pops open the glovebox.  He shoves some maps and garbage
aside, reaches deeper inside for something -- we don't see
what.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Cassandra walks a trio of well-dressed DRUG DEALERS (two
alien, one human) through the deserted club.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

She leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets
them enter ahead of her.  A couple of them smile at her
lasciviously as they brush past.  She is about to enter
herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering
her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door.

It is Jetson.  He had been hiding behind some crates
stacked here in the corridor.  He pins Cassandra
powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth.
She struggles until she sees who it is.

			JETSON
	I am here to take Harcourt.  Where
	is he?

She hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a
nod toward the office door.

			CASSANDRA
	In there.

			JETSON
		   (pulling his gun)
	Show me.


INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

The large suitcase rests on the expansive conference
table.  A manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens
it.  Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the
viscous blue drug.  Also several of the small, individual
dispensers.  It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in
a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase.  He is
flanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room.
The room is lit by track light, creating pools of light
and dark.

The two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the
drug.  The human dealer doesn't know what it is.

			HARCOURT
		   (to alien dealers)
	It's been a long time, hasn't it,
	gentlemen?

			HUMAN DEALER
	What is it?

			HARCOURT
	A sweet indulgence from out past...
	resurrected for our future.

Harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien
Dealers' faces... smiles knowingly.  He slides one of the
dispensers from the suitcase.

			HARCOURT
		   (continuing; to
		    alien  dealers)
	Please feel free to sample the
	quality.  The experience will be
	everything you remember it to be...

One of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to
his tongue.  The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt--

			ALIEN DEALER
	Where'd you get it?

			HARCOURT
	I arranged to spend some time with
	three very resourceful men.  With a
	certain amount of coaxing, one of
	them was able to reconstitute the
	formula for me.
		   (beat)
	They worked very well together.
	Unfortunately, they are no longer
	with us... but I was fortunate
	enough to reap the benefit of their
	endeavor.

He indicates the drug.  The first alien Dealer sways
gently, enjoying the sensation.  The second alien Dealer
takes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over
him.  The human Dealer is no fool... he grabs the
dispenser.

			HUMAN DEALER
	Let me try some.
		   (he does,
		    immediately spits
		    it out)
	Jesus!  Tastes like detergent!

			HARCOURT
	And that's all the effect it will
	have on you.  But when my fellow
	Newcomers learn they can obtain it
	here, they will work very hard... to
	make as much money as they can... to
	give it to me.

Suddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to
the other office:

			VOICE
	You haven't told him all of it.

Harcourt and the others react.  Quint leaps to his feet,
caught off guard.  Kipling reaches for his shoulder
holster.  A silhouette beside the open door to the outer
office nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then
steps out himself.  It is Jetson.

Quint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes
go wide at the sight of something Jetson holds.

It is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring
to the slug-mobile.  The wires are connected and Jetson's
finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch.

			QUINT
	He's got the C-4 charge!

Jetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of
him.  He is sweating rivers.  The others quickly join him.
He nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he
can see her.

			QUINT
		   (continuing)
	Just take it real casual, buddy.
	Keep your finger on that button and
	don't do nothing squirrely.

			HARCOURT
	If you release that button, you not
	only kill us, but yourself.

			JETSON
	To get you and that--
		   (indicates drug in
		    suitcase)
	-- I would do it.

He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that
Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.

			JETSON
	Everyone up against that wall.
	Very slowly.
		   (to Harcourt)
	Except you.

Harcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where
she is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall.
Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen.

Jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosses
it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it.
All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.

			HARCOURT
	One small matter seems to have
	escaped your attention.  That--
		   (indicates suitcase)
	-- is not on any books as a
	controlled substance.  Legally it
	might as well be fifty kilos of...
	grape jelly.

			JETSON
	The charge is murder... and
	conspiracy to commit murder.
	Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably
	others.

There's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue
eyes.

Cassandra stares at Harcourt.

			CASSANDRA
	You... you killed Strader?

Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket.

			CASSANDRA
	Where's Todd?!  Did you do something
	to Todd?!

Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.

			HARCOURT
	Todd?  Who is Todd.
		   (then remembers;
		    smiles)
	Ah, poor Mr. Watson.

Cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said
sinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They
start out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357
and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's
face.

			JETSON
	NOOO!

Jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He
manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet
going into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a
mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead
wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart.
Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch...
and nothing happens.

			KIPLING
	I got it!

Kipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the
floor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her
with it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously
hits her again.

Meanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling
rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm
-- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over
forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into
Jetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into
the wall face-first, pinning him there.

			HARCOURT
	Kill them both.

			KIPLING
	Here?

			HARCOURT
		   (raging)
	Do it!

Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the
base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger.
There's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks
up.

Quint is blown backward away from her.

Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the
Casull smoking in his hand.

Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid
wall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He
crashes through it.

ANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR

as the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint
cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds.

ANGLE - IN THE OFFICE

Kipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at
Sykes.

Sykes dodges into the private office for cover.

The three Dealers dive behind any available furniture.

Harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door
leading into the adjoining outer office.

Sykes swings around the edge of the private office door,
straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires.
Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door,
covering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down.

An unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and
Kipling escaping, and takes off after them.

Sykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees
Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He
moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in
surrender, rise from behind the furniture.

			ALIEN DEALER
	Don't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --
	look!

Sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra.

			SYKES
	You okay?

			CASSANDRA
		   (dazed, but all
		    right)
	Yeah...

And he charges out the adjoining office door.


EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.  Jetson
is ten feet above them.  Sykes flies out onto the fire
escape, a few steps behind Jetson.  A POLICE CAR SIREN is
HEARD arriving O.S.


EXT.  ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT

Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into
the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running.

Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the
fire escape, find themselves near the unit.

			HARCOURT
	Here!

He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps
in.  Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear
and floors it.

Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels
out.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing
car.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the
rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.

			JETSON
	This way!

He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to
it, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls
out.

A second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,
heading straight for the slug-mobile.  Sykes has to grate
between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get
past.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come
thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic.
The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them.

INSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE

Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches...
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and
SIREN blast on.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing
the howling police car through traffic.

Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it
out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy.

			JETSON
	Slow traffic on your right... you're
	clear at the left rear...
		   (Sykes changes lanes)
	Careful, red light ahead...

With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the
cross-traffic without incident.


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response
to the approaching lights and SIREN.  Kipling dodges
around the stopped traffic easily.

The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car
now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the
slug-mobile.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same
juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley.

			JETSON
	Yellow light ahead turning red...

But Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it.

			JETSON
		   (continuing; wide-
		    eyed)
	Red light!  Red light!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the
intersection, and continues the chase.  On the wrong side
of the road, head-on into traffic.

Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along
the wrong side.  They eventually catch up to the police
unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between
them.

Sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull
with the other.  He brings it up and around right in front
of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window
at Kipling.

At that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the
bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser.

Jetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to
something else he sees beyond it.

			JETSON
	Green light, Matthew.
		   (Sykes doesn't
		    respond)
	Green light!

Now Sykes looks.  The light at the intersection has just
turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting
start coming.  It's a wall of headlights coming right for
the slug-mobile.

			SYKES
	Shit!

			JETSON
	Ss-ai!


EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes locks up the brakes.  Kipling veers around a couple
of cars and speeds away.

Because of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of
action.  He skids a left onto a side street.


EXT.  SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a
right onto another street that parallels the street the
police unit is on.  At the first street available, he cuts
back in behind the police unit.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

Sykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the
police unit directly above them!  An on-ramp approaches
for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug-
mobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a
few feet behind the black-and-white's bumper.


EXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT

With the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right,
cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto--


EXT.  SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT

The police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street
tunnel.  It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a
pile-up of traffic behind the police unit.

The slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of
traffic in the tunnel.  Sykes is out of the drivers door
in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--

			SYKES
	Move your goddamned cars!

People climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --
ignoring Sykes.  Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his
bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car
far enough forward to get around.  He speeds off.


INT./ EXT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT

Kipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp.  Harcourt smiles
with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile
behind them.  Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of
traffic.


EXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT

Sykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian
traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at
Indianapolis.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead.

			JETSON
	There!

Sykes sees it.  Thinking fast, he eases off, using another
car as a blind.  He waits until the police unit is
parallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right,
directly for the police unit.

Kipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile
broadsides the police unit.  Sykes forces the police unit
up the off-ramp.


EXT.  INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Door handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the
right.  The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes
stays right on its ass.  They charge up onto--


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

The police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80
MPH.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

As the cars scream along, Jetson cranes out the side
window, looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing
past below.


EXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT

They reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

A clear two lane straightaway near the ocean.  Sykes
pushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the
police unit.  The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.
Kipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,
slowing him down.


INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT

Kipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror,
then looks back out the front to see the end of the road
coming up fast!  Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on
the brakes.


EXT.  END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain
link fence where the road ends.  An abandoned drawbridge
and the ocean are on the other side of the fence.

With nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at
Kipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The two cars are racing for a full head-on.  At the last
instant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile
sideways, passenger side first.  The police unit smashes
into the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both
cars skidding madly to a stop.  A fire ignites under the
hood of the police unit.


INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT

Sykes sits stunned behind the wheel.  Disoriented but
conscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees Jetson
out cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding.  Then he looks
over and sees the fire growing under the police unit's
hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug-
mobile -- near the gas tank.


EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to
Jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge
unconscious alien away from the cars.

He's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt
pulling himself through the smashed police unit window.
Bruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the
suitcase, then starts to run with it.

With Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes
clambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off
after Harcourt.

Harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the
closed drawbridge.  He heaves the suitcase over, then
starts to climb.

Sykes lumbers past the burning police unit.  Kipling is
still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward.  Sykes
is just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods
and door panels and glass flying in all directions.
Harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the
suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the
abandoned drawbridge.

Sykes reaches the fence.  Instead of climbing, he simply
blows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the
gate.


EXT.  ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT

The end of the bridge is in the "up" position... a huge
asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky.  Harcourt
runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the
bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him.  His
foot slips once and he almost goes over the side.

Sykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a
prominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.

Harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --
and has nowhere to go.  He is backed into a corner, with
seawater on two side of him.  Harcourt pivots frantically,
sees Sykes coming this way.  Harcourt is a trapped animal.
His chest heaves in panic.  Then his gaze falls on the
suitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of
resolve comes into his eye.

ON SYKES

He eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows
Harcourt is.  There's some movement among the shadows, and
Sykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against
the trigger.

Perspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.
A long moment then--

ANGLE - THE SHADOWS

Harcourt emerges from the darkness.  His face is composed,
the superior glint is back in his eye.  His arms are held
away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in
surrender.

Sykes cat-steps forward slowly.  Harcourt stares at Sykes'
eyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an
excuse.  Harcourt simply... smiles.

			SYKES
	Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're
	history...

			HARCOURT
	No, Sergeant -- not history...
		   (beat)
	Eternity...

And now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of
the one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind
his arm.  He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,
then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.
The blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin.  His
mouth fills.

He looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes
mad, defiant.  And -- he swallows.  Long hold -- then the
wallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in
agony as he begins to convulse.  Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers
the Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and
goes into a massive violent seizure.  His limbs hammer
against the deck... his back arches fiercely.  It is a
brutal, agonizing ten seconds.  Then, finally, his body
becomes still.

Sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to
him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA

Sykes stands.  He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,
and hefts it.  He carries it with him back toward the
inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and
cold in his hand.

ANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES

He approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.  As he
passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register
that the driver's door of the police unit is now open
before--

-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!  Sykes
is thrown forward.  The suitcase crashes to the ground,
and the Casull goes skittering off.  Sykes looks up -- to
be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of
Kipling!  Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes
hears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.  He looks -- and
sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.  It
connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who
killed Bill Tuggle!

Kipling brings the suitcase above his head.  He is a half-
second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN
ROARS.  Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.  Sykes
looks.

ANGLE

Jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.

Kipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the
suitcase again.  Jetson, shaking but determined, fires
again, and again, and again.

Kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase
still over his head... until he is blasted at last and
forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the
inferno.

Sykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.  Jetson has
let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.
Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the
alien's hand.  The two partners remain like this, bathed
in the orange flickering glow of the fire.

HIGH WIDE SHOT

of the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two
cops...

				    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

The police mop-up is winding down.  Cop cars, coroner's
wagons, fire trucks.  We MOVE through it all to find Sykes
and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing.

			JETSON
	With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I
	assume you will be requesting
	reassignment now.

			SYKES
		   (cool)
	It'd be for your own good.  I think
	you'd be better off with a partner
	who's a little more... by the book.
		   (smiles)
	... Still, I gotta tell you, George,
	for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on
	wheels once you get going.  I'd
	kinda hate to miss your next two
	days as a detective.

Jetson smiles.  He glances up as they are bathed in red
and blue light.  A patrol car has pulled up next to them.
Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.

			WILTEY
	I'll give you guys a lift to the
	station.  They're waiting to take
	your statements on the shootings.

			SYKES
		   (to Jetson)
	Let's go, partner.
		   (then casually
		    correcting Wiltey
		    as he rises)
	And it's shooting.  Singular.

			WILTEY
	They said two.

			SYKES
	Nope.  I didn't shoot Harcourt... he
	o.d.'d.

SHOCK CUT - JETSON

We rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward
Sykes.  His expression tells us his blood has just turned
to ice.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  CORONER'S WAGON - NIGHT

ANGLE FORWARD, shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward
the DRIVER and ATTENDANT up front.

			DRIVER
	So it's just me and her left in the
	hot tub, right?

			ATTENDANT
	You and the blonde?

			DRIVER
	No, man, the redhead.  The blonde's
	gone in the house with some other
	guy.  But a few minutes later she
	comes back out, alone, when me and
	the redhead are going at it fast and
	furious in the tub, ya know... and
	she sees us, and... she climbs right
	in with us...

			ATTENDANT
	You're full of shit!

			DRIVER
	I swear it!  If I'm lyin', I'm
	dyin'...

And, without warning, A LARGE INHUMAN HAND FLIES UP IN
F.G., having ripped through the sealed body bag just below
FRAME.

				    CUT TO:

INT.  SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

Jetson is up front with Wiltey; Sykes sits in the back,
though he is on the edge of the seat, leaning forward
toward the front.  Jetson is intently, nervously scanning
ahead and to both sides.

			JETSON
	You are certain this is the route
	they would have taken?

			WILTEY
	I'm not positive -- but probably.

			SYKES
		   (warily)
	What's this about, George?  I know
	that look.

			JETSON
		   (spots something out
		    a side window)
	There!  Go back.  Down that side
	street.

Wiltey brakes, backs up, then turns into the side street.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

as they approach an eerie scene.  The coroner's wagon is
stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection,
headlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the
back doors wide open.  A patrol car is also here, on the
other side of the wagon.  There is no movement anywhere
near the two vehicles.

Wiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the
eerie scene.  He reaches for the radio hand mike.  Jetson
quickly covers it with a large hand.

			JETSON
	No!
		   (both Sykes and
		    Wiltey look at him)
	We must do this alone.

			SYKES
	Do what?!  George-- ?!

Jetson is already sliding out of the car.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns
drawn.  They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's
flashlight, shines it through the open back doors.  The
doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.
One of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from
end to end.  The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol
car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.

Jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,
Sykes and Wiltey follow.  Lights all ablaze, it too is
abandoned.  One door has been wrenched off its hinges and
lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.
Our three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots
something beyond the unit.

			WILTEY
	Oh, God...

Sykes and Jetson look.

The bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as
well as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed
and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt.  Their arms
are twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down
the street toward the dock warehouses ahead.  Wiltey
stumbles away, backward.

			WILTEY
	I'm calling for back up, now.

			JETSON
	Wiltey, no.

But Wiltey is going.  Jetson starts after him... but Sykes
grabs his arm, hard, and spins him.

			SYKES
	What is this?!

			JETSON
		   (low)
	... It's Harcourt.

			SYKES
	Harcourt is dead.

			JETSON
	No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on
	the drug.
		   (searches for the
		    words)
	Massive amounts trigger a... a
	change.  Your body functions seize
	up, you appear to be dead, but it's
	really a state of incubation.  When
	you emerge you're...

			SYKES
		   (looks at the four
		    bodies sprawled
		    before him)
	Tell me about it...

				    CUT TO:

EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

One minute later.  OPEN CLOSE on a light shining into
CAMERA, then WIDEN to reveal it is one of the door-mounted
spotlights on Wiltey's patrol car.  Wiltey eases the car
down the center of the street.  Sykes and Jetson, guns
ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes
everywhere.

MOVING POV

as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching
for any signs of movement.

BACK TO SCENE

Sykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as
they walk.  Their eyes everywhere.

			SYKES
	I never thought I'd say this, but --
	for once in my life I think I'm
	willing to wait for back-up.

			JETSON
	We can't let him get away.

			SYKES
	Why the hell are you so dead set
	against back-up?

			JETSON
		   (a difficult
		    admission)
	Because... because of what will
	happen if humans see what we are
	capable of becoming.

			SYKES
	But there's no more drug.

			JETSON
	You understand that.  But how many
	others will?

Sykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression.

Just then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across
his headlight beams fifty yards ahead.  Whatever it was,
was large and fast.  It darted into an open warehouse
door.

			WILTEY
	There he is!

And Wiltey floors it.  Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to
stop him.

			JETSON
	Wiltey!

He and Sykes take off running.  Wiltey skids to the left,
rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.
Sykes and Jetson pour it on.  They hear a SCREECH OF
BRAKES.  They reach the warehouse door and race through.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

LOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's
stopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear
around the corner of the warehouse door.  The car is still
running -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling
fumes.  The feet slow... then cautiously start around the
car.  We PAN with them as they move around the side of the
car.  A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G.  We
MOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper.  The dark liquid
is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome.  We MOVE
UP farther, and--

-- there is Wiltey's severed head.  IN CLOSE UP, resting
on the hood of the patrol car.

Sykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight.  Wiltey's body
lies in a heap on the floor near the car.  They both
stare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the
warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have
done this so fast?

THEIR POV

There are two paths to go.  Both dark and scary as hell.
The sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and
DRIPS of this waterfront building.

ANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON

Jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun
from the dash mount.  He checks the chamber as Sykes
checks the Casull.

They exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they
split up.  Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the
right.

WITH JETSON

As he moves into a dark area.  He slowly picks his way
along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled
debris, heading toward us.  We PAN slightly to the left to
HOLD a door in CLOSE UP.  The door, already ajar, eases
open slightly wider.  Jetson hears this.  He reaches the
door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all
the way.  There's nothing inside... now.

Jetson looks up, sees movement in the distance.  It is
Sykes, quite far away, in another section of the
warehouse.  Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Sykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head
as he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER.
He eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table
and a chair.  On the table is a mini-television, tuned to
some local late night talk show.  There's a thermos, a
steaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite
out of it beside the TV.  The chair is empty, except for a
jacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched
on the breast.  The guard is nowhere in sight.

Sykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight.
He looks around, then continues on.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a
set of stairs leading to an upper floor.  The top of the
stairs is pitch black.  Jetson adjusts his grip on the
shotgun, slowly starts up the stairs.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT

Sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging
from the ceiling.  He has no alternate route -- he begins
pushing through them.

SYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS

Because of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack
of nets immediately before him.  He keeps wading through
-- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much
farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the
deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the
way he came.  He pushes past one particular rack of nets
and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is--

-- a terrifying face!

ON SYKES

He stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the
Casull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is.
It's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship.
The wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous
visage.  Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start
his heart again.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Jetson moves along the rickety planks.  He comes to a
door.  He eases it open, enters.


INT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT

Jetson moves into the shadowy confines.  He hears an
incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner.  He moves
to it.  Turns the spigot, stopping the drip.  Other drips
are HEARD from a dozen other hidden recesses all around
him.  He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the
wall above the sink.  Suddenly he sees the movement of
something behind him.  He spins with the shotgun.  A huge
shadow moves along the wall.  He pivots the shotgun again
-- toward the source of the shadow.

It's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the
ceiling.  Jetson lets out a deep breath.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway.
A strand of something hangs in FRAME in OUT OF FOCUS F.G.
It makes an indistinct, rhythmic CLINKING SOUND.  Sykes
moves along the intersecting hallway.  The CLINKING SOUND
catches his attention.  He stops, listens, then starts
down the passageway, toward us.

He comes forward into the storage room, having to get very
close to the strand of something before he sees what it
is.  It's a double strand of chain, CLINKING gently
against itself.  Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain,
silencing it.  He considers.  It could've been a natural
occurrence... or something could have brushed against it,
setting it in motion.  He tightens his grip on the Casull,
backing away from the chain.  He senses something behind
him and spins.  Nothing there.  He relaxes.  However--

Behind him now, in SOFT FOCUS, we glimpse movement at the
other end of the short passageway.  It is a figure, moving
slowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the
hallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway
as it approaches Sykes.  It stops, inside the room now,
directly behind Sykes.  Close enough to reach out and
touch him.  It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more
powerful.

Suddenly, Sykes senses something is there.  He turns,
slowly, and--

SHOCK CUT - HARCOURT

as he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last
time Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge.  Only this
time it is a horribly transformed Harcourt.  His eyes are
red-rimmed and piggish.  His head is lumpen, his skin
thick and hard.  His neck muscles are corded -- giving him
a kind of hellish cobra's cowl.  There is still
intelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral
intelligence now.

			HARCOURT
		   (his voice a guttural
		    rumble)
	Looking for me, Sergeant?

Sykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the
Casull, and fires.  The powerful Casull round catches
Harcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back.


EXT.  WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT

Jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing
blast of the Casull.  He gauges as best he can the
direction it came from and takes off running.


INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

Harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact.  The
cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder-
burned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin.
Harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts
toward Sykes.

Scared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires.  One of his shots
misses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head.  The
remaining shots strike Harcourt full on.  Harcourt is
jerked by the impact of the bullets each time, SNARLING in
anger -- but none of the hits stop him.  The Casull is
empty and Harcourt keeps coming.

Sykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash.
Harcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard.  We
HEAR the POP as the shoulder dislocates.  Sykes HOLLERS,
and the gun jumps out of his hand.


INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT

Jetson races in, shotgun ready.  The last of Sykes' shots
are still ECHOING.  Jetson looks around, frustrated,
unable to tell exactly where they are coming from.  He
sees the likely path and charges that way.


EXT.  DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

On the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these
rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,
having been thrown ruthlessly from above.  As Sykes' body
sprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt
appears at the top of the stairs.

Sykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.
Harcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the
railing the last fifteen feet.  Harcourt lurches forward
and, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him
down the docks.


EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT

The first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at
the coroner's wagon.  The Officers leap out, flagging
other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Sykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost
collapses again.  Harcourt comes at him.  Then Sykes sees
it--

-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of
the jetties.  Sykes makes a break for it.


EXT.  WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT

Jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,
frantically scanning for any sign of Sykes.  Then, in the
distance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty
-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt.  Jetson
gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive
look, then gathers up his courage, and races down the
stairs to help Sykes.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty.  The fishing boat is
already passing the end of the jetty.  Harcourt is fast
behind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults
off toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing
net piled on the rear deck.  He yells in pain as his ankle
twists under his weight.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,
relieved that he has escaped.


EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT

Harcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes
did, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then
onto a second jetty.  And from here, he vaults across the
seawater onto the boat.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the
cabin.  The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the
open sea.


EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT

Jetson sees this and is shitting bricks.  Suddenly the
stark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from
above.  Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,
the sun-gun washing over the docks.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically
waving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down.  The
Pilot starts to take it down.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net
toward the back of the boat.  Harcourt gets one hand on
his leg.  Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws
dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls
away.  Sykes BELLOWS in pain.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the
dock.  He has to catch himself from falling out the open
door.  Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto
the dock.

			JETSON
	On that boat -- out there!

Jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth
of the channel.  The helicopter tilts forward and goes.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging
over the stern of the fishing boat.  He pushes to the back
of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the
bow.  Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey
trapped.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the
channel water racing past beneath.  They come up on the
boat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck,
looking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt
at the stern dinghy.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back
at what the sun-gun spotlights.  He sees Harcourt standing
at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.

			CAPTAIN
	Hey!


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.
He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.  He rears back
with it and lets it fly like a spear.


EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

The gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.
The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back
against the throttle.  The boat lunges forward as the
engines REV loudly.


EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT

Harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.  As
Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie
line on the dinghy.  He lunges forward, throwing the
ratchet.  The line plays out, and the dinghy slides
backward into water!


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson watches this happen.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

The dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie
line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.

Harcourt claws his way toward Sykes.  Water is already
splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is
sinking.  Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward
him.  Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his
might.  Harcourt yanks him free.  Sykes kicks wildly at
the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the
line.  Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--

-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.  The rest
of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the
dinghy from the fishing boat!

The dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.  A wave from
the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.  Some
of it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.  Sykes
sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is
on him again.  Sykes' body weight at the side of the
dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to
wash in over the transom.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy
below.


EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT

Harcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in
agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water
touches.  Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.  Harcourt
sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib
cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt
off balance.  Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the
first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of
them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the
dinghy.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically
clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still
above the water.  Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's
partially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top
of Sykes, and drags him under.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting
to help, knowing he can't.


EXT.  WATER - NIGHT

Sykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a
body unmoving but still on top of him.  Sykes shoves it
away, struggling to stay afloat.  His head keeps dunking
under.  He's drowning.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Jetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot.

			JETSON
	Take it down!  Take it down!


EXT.  WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.
Jetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking
under again.  The helicopter's skids are three feet above
the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	ALL THE WAY!

			PILOT
	I CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!

Sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but
the skid is just too high.  Jetson has no alternative, and
he does the bravest thing he has ever done.  He moves out
onto the narrow helicopter skid.  Hanging on, three feet
above the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching
hand.

The fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from
each other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the
two hands meet!  Jetson winces from the pain of the
seawater on Sykes' hand.  He starts pulling Sykes up.
When--

HARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'
FACE.  His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone.  The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,
breaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under
again.

Jetson is frantic.  He keeps waiting -- but this time
Sykes doesn't come up.  Jetson doesn't know what to do.
Finally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot
from the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his
own arm below the surface!  He feels around, gets hold of
something, and pulls.  It is Sykes' wrist.  He pulls hard,
bringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.

			JETSON
		   (to Pilot)
	Take it up!

The Pilot does.  Sykes comes up out of the water.  His
feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand
and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.
Sykes looks down in horror.  The helicopter keeps moving
up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm
tears away from the torso at the shoulder.  Sykes wildly
shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it
falls back into the water below.

Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it
moves off toward shore.


INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Sykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his
limp arm.  Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket,
wrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain.
The Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they
just pulled Sykes from.

			PILOT
	What the hell was that down there?
	It was weird.

Jetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say.  Sykes
looks at Jetson a long moment, then--

			SYKES
	Looked like every other damn slag to
	me.  Just plain ugly.

Despite the pain, Jetson smiles.

				 LONG DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY

We are CLOSE on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time,
trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling.  A
PAIR OF ALIEN ARMS reach into FRAME to help him.  One of
the alien arms is also in a sling.

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the alien is Jetson.  Both men wear
tuxedos.

			SYKES
	How do I look?

			JETSON
	You look very good.

There's a knock at the door.  Sykes opens it.  There
stands Sykes' daughter, KRISTIN, twenty years old, looking
radiant in her wedding dress.  She is in a foyer, and
behind her is the interior of the church with all the
assembled guests, including Mrs. Jetson & son.

			KRISTIN
	Ready, Daddy...?

Sykes' heart melts.  Before moving to the door:

			SYKES
	George, uh... I want to apologize
	now, in advance, for all the rotten
	things I'll ever say or do to you
	over the years.

Sykes moves to join his daughter.  As he does:

			JETSON
	That is all right, Matthew.  After
	all, you are only human.

Sykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.

			SYKES
		   (under his breath)
	What a wildman...

Sykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start
down the aisle.

				    FADE OUT.

PREDATOR

Screenplay by Peter Briggs

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

We OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS, a sea of stars spread across the infinite 
depths of space.  As the TITLES ROLL, we notice that three of these 
specks seem to be moving; one of them picking up acceleration and 
racing toward us.  Our perspective changes, and we catch a quick 
glimpse as it HURTLES past, and into the gravitational pull of a large 
brownish planet.  Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere.  
It seems to be manmade.  Or at least artificial.

EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The planet is dead, barren.  Death Valley on a grand scale.  We watch 
the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover, emitting a few last 
burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance.  A 
BOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains, before settling back 
into an eerie silence.

EXT.  FISSURE CANYON - DAY

We're looking into a deep gorge, dark and sinister.  A howling wind 
whips dust into a sandstorm, reducing visibility to almost zero.  About 
seventy feet down there's a hole in the rock-face that just might be a 
cave entrance, and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air.  We hear a 
mechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears, replaced by FIVE 
humanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet 
tall.  They are PREDATORS, a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on 
permanent safari; their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of 
aborigine and ultra-hi-tech.  In their hands are circular metal discs; 
'smart weapons' which cut into the stone and give them purchase.

PREDATOR-VISION.  

From their P.O.V., we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES.  
The entrance registers as a black gaping void.

INT.  FISSURE NEST TUNNEL

The five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel, out of the wind's 
banshee wailing.  The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear, pulling 
at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus.  
He removes the helmet, clips it to his rear utility pack, and takes a 
deep breath of the air.  A curious speckled pattern runs across his 
wide forehead, marking him 
different to the others; in addition, one of the fangs of his mandibles 
has been sheared away.  We'll call him BROKEN TUSK, he's the leader of 
the hunting party.  He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the 
tunnel.

Several feet in from the rim, it changes from rock to a textured 
biomechanical surface; a swirling mass of disturbing shapes.  He 
hurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who 
has found something.

The other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny.  Skewered 
on the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented 
tail; it's a FACEHUGGER, the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform.  
BROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party; they respond by pulling 
spears and elaborately-shaped swords.  Several shoulder-mounted plasma 
cannons slide up to firing position, tracking with their owners' 
helmets.  Thus armed, they move cautiously ahead...taking no chances.  
One helmeted PREDATOR pauses, scanning the area.

PREDATOR-VISION.  

He switches through a variety of different views; infra-red, ultra-
violet, enhanced motion-tracking.  Nothing.

He's so pre-occupied with this task, he totally fails to notice the 
skeletal ALIEN loom up behind him, emerging from the biomechanical 
growth on the floor.  A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight 
through the neck, splashing luminous blood across his chestplate.  A 
gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat, the band of PREDATORS 
spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground.  The 
band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid; they 
themselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS.  The carnage is 
swift and terrifying, a blur of motion.

Steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air, alive 
with the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries.  One PREDATOR is pinned 
against the tunnel wall, his spear out of range.  The ALIEN claws away 
his face mask, and he finds himself dodging the ALIEN's toothed tongue, 
extended toward him with pile-driver speed.  He reaches down, grasping 
the 'smart-weapon' hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc 
that terminates at the ALIEN's grinning face.  Big mistake.  The two 
are in such close proximity that the ALIEN's acidic blood sprays across 
the PREDATOR's head.  While their technology seems to be resistant to 
it, their bodies aren't:  the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into 
the PREDATOR's skin.  He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS 
PIERCING SCREAM, clawing at his seared face. 

It all seems to be over as quickly as it began; there can be no 
question as to who were the victors.  The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea 
of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house.  As his 
companions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls, BROKEN TUSK 
steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades.  The first 
PREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly; he crosses to the other.  
What he finds causes him to react with
pity and disgust.  His fallen comrade is only just alive; mandibles 
clicking frailly, half his head burnt away.  BROKEN TUSK watches the 
ailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from it's sheath and offer it to 
him.  He takes it, knowing what has to be done.  Rolling the knife 
quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick 
seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen 
hunter.  This unpleasant task accomplished,

BROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer.  A dark 
shape blots out the light coming from the entrance; a small PREDATOR 
shuttlecraft, sleek and elegant.  It hovers in the air with little more 
than a loud HUM, and extends a ramp.  The surviving PREDATORS leap 
aboard, carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men 
returning from combat.

One more thing need to be done.  BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a 
sequence of keys on the dead PREDATOR's wrist.  A countdown is 
displayed in some unknown character-set, accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED 
BEEPING.  He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes 
smoothly to the air, it's undergear retracting.

EXT.  PLANET SURFACE - DAY

A white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure, the result of the 
PREDATOR's suicide-destruct mechanism.  The shuttlecraft pulls quickly 
away, disappearing into the clouds.

EXT.  SPACE

A large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet; the 
PREDATOR Mothership.  The shuttle heads swiftly towards it. 


INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY

An airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the 
Mothership's docking bay.  An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut 
takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly 
look up at them.  Like the PREDATORS themselves, the ship is a curious 
mixture of old and new.  An elaborate frieze written in alien script 
runs around the wall, with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed 
into it.  Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship; we see BROKEN 
TUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them. 

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship.  
BROKEN TUSK enters, pausing next to a kind of readout device:  a 
cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which 
constantly changes it's mass into shapes and alien text.  He peers over 
the protective railing. 

WHAT HE SEES is magnificent:  a captive QUEEN ALIEN, the nucleus of the 
ALIEN society, fed by giant intravenous pipes.  Each of it's limbs is 
tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement.  To the rear, 
it's giant egg-sac glows and throbs, suspended by a jury-rigged sling.  
A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays, seemingly 
defying gravity.  As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam - 
similar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent, giving us a 
view of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside.  This done, a manipulator are 
carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet, which then sinks into a 
hatchway in the floor.  It's an assembly-line of almost frightening 
mechanical efficiency.

EXT.  SPACE

We see a pod ejected from the Mothership, rocketing away from the 
planet into deep space.  The inference is obvious; the PREDATORS are 
seeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt.

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The blue beam slides across one of the eggs, and suddenly changes to 
red, BEEPING rapidly.  BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter 
from a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull to a 
representation of a QUEEN's head.  The manipulator arm swiftly grasps 
the EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor.  
The causes the QUEEN to go
berserk, straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously.  She's 
obviously been through this before and knows what's about to happen.  
The protrusionsplits open, spilling out an intense white light:  an 
energy-filled blast furnace.  The manipulator claw opens, the EGG drops 
in, and is no more.

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS

An orange light plays across a wall of skulls, casting dark shadows 
into long-empty orbs.  BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat 
slab of rock in the center of the room, inspecting his formidable 
arsenal of weaponry. Satisfied, he reaches out to run a finger across 
the jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture.  He regards it 
for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind, before 
finally getting to his feet. 

INT.  PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The lights in the gallery are dimmer when BROKEN TUSK enters.  He 
watches the cherry-red beam of the gliding SCANNING MECHANISM lock onto 
one of the EGGS, then runs his hand in sequence over the control board.  
The manipulator arm swings over, seizing the egg and loading it onto a 
waiting pallet. 

BROKEN TUSK points his finger at the QUEEN and makes a guttural 
CLICKING SOUND from deep in his throat.  The effect is not unlike that 
of a child firing an imaginary gun.  As if reading BROKEN TOOTH's 
thoughts, the QUEEN lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous 
HISS of contempt.

EXT.  SPACE

In CENTER FRAME, the planet sits still and green, awash with nebulous 
clouds. A hulking METAL FORM ROLLS RIGHT-TO-LEFT across our view, 
sunlight glinting from it's surface.  It's a rectangular satellite-
construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a 
latticework of steel tubing.  We hear FILTERED HUMAN VOICES O.S.  
Subspace chatter.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY

Imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of 
treetop foliage, and you've just drawn yourself a picture of the planet 
Ryushi.

Nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the Yutani-Templin 
Communications Relay Station.  Several inverted-'U'-shaped suspension 
cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of 
preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on 
platforms, much like a truncated oil-rig.  A navigation beacon flashes 
intermittently from a tall gantry tower above, while dominating the 
view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes 
high.  Off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many-wheeled 
haulage vehicle.  A flock of bird-like creatures fly past.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

We're in the dark womb of a split-level command center alive with 
clusters of video readouts, somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air-
traffic control tower.  On the upper tier, a large circular holo-
display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw.  Thin 
trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air 
conditioning ducks, though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of 
the people manning the consoled here.  We move in on CASSIE DOLLANDER 
and ROB PARSONS, two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank.  
CASSIE listens carefully to something on her headset. 

CASSIE
Ah, negative on that request commercial freighter 'Nan-Shan'.  I've 
already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix.  Hold on 
my mark until I get back with some confirmation.  Rimward Traffic 
Control out.

She thumbs a button and leans over to PARSONS.

CASSIE (CONT'D)
How's it looking?

PARSONS worriedly shakes his head.

PARSONS
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.

CASSIE
Better tell the boss.

PARSONS pulls out a coin.

PARSONS
Toss you for it.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE

HIROKO NOGUCHI is sweating heavily, a black forelock of hair falling 
across her Oriental features.  Her eyes flicker warily from side-to-
side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her, trying to 
assess from where the next attack will come.  She doesn't have to wait 
long; two NINJA SWORDSMEN drop to the floor in front of her, striking 
without hesitation.

She expertly avoid the blows, parrying relentlessly.  A persistent TONE 
begins to intrude O.S., like a telephone RINGING.  She tries to ignore 
it, but her concentration is clearly broken.  A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears 
from out of nowhere, his sword SWISHING towards her chest.  The blade 
plunges deep into her stomach, emerging from her back.  She glances 
down in annoyed disbelief.

HIROKO
Fuck!  Holo off.

The SWORDSMEN immediately flicker and disappear.  She sheathes the 
sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to 
her desk. Mopping her face with a towel, she thumbs a stud.  The 
RINGING TONE stops, the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel 
replaced with a black girl's face.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Noguchi.

CASSIE  (O.S., onscreen)
Something just came up on Deep Space Tracking.

HIROKO
What kind of 'something'?

CASSIE   (O.S., onscreen)
Easier if you come down and look.

HIROKO
I'm on my way.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY

An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain, 
climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outpost's empty 
main-street.  A group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds 
indigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at it's 
approach.  The crawler's pneumatics HISS gently as it comes to a halt, 
while somewhere off in the distance a dog BARKS.  

DON KAMEN, a lean man in his forties. climbs down from the cab mounted 
five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna. He 
adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the 
street towards one of the buildings, ignoring a Pepsi sign CREAKING in 
the gentle breeze.  A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open 
before him. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

KAMEN steps into the command center, nodding familiarly to the DUTY 
PERSONNEL.  A long-haired labrador rushes up to KAMEN, wagging it's 
tail. Her name is BREWSTER.  She's the base mascot.  KAMEN reaches down 
and ruffles it's fur.  He climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier, 
pulling the French-plaited hair of ANNIE URIOSTE, an Italian systems-
mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console.

URIOSTE
You didn't wipe your feet coming in.

KAMEN
Well, it's okay.  You didn't tell me it was monsoon season going out.

PARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins.

PARSONS
Hey, buenos dias, cowboy.  When d'you blow in?

KAMEN places his hat on PARSONS' head and THUMPS it down.

KAMEN
Just got back.  Missed anything?

URIOSTE   (snorts)
Yeah.  We're almost out of beer.

PARSONS
Ahh, don't pay any attention to Urioste. She's still pissed that 
Noguchi wouldn't let her go off on your hunting trip.

KAMEN pours himself a cup of coffee from a BUBBLING percolator.

KAMEN
Wasn't my trip, I just did the driving. 'Sides, freezing my butt off 
out in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isn't my idea of 
a good time, either.

He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid.

PARSONS
Where'd you leave them?

KAMEN
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making 
their own way back tomorrow.

CASSIE
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.

KAMEN
Shit.  When?

CASSIE
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story 
on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.

KAMEN looks ill.

KAMEN
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.

CASSIE
You win some, you loose some.

KAMEN
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything 
else you wanna ruin my day with?

CASSIE
No, but I got something that might interest you.

HIROKO enters, pulling on a leather jacket.

HIROKO
What've you got?

KAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble.  They 
turn to watch the display clear, replaced with a computer simulation of 
the neighboring solar system.

CASSIE
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen 
twenty-four local time.

PARSONS
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just 
to make sure.

CASSIE
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.

The simulation ZOOMS IN, revealing two unidentified objects heading 
towards the planet in the center of the display.  Computer notations 
accompany them.

CASSIE (CONT'D)
Curious thing is, the mass detector says they're too small to carry a 
deep-space drive.

HIROKO
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.

PARSONS
That's what we thought.

HIROKO
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?

PARSONS
Done it already.  Nothing matches.

CASSIE
And if you thought that was interesting, watch this...

HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change.

KAMEN
Jesus.

PARSONS
Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're 
looking at.

KAMEN
Tactical nukes, maybe?

Everybody gives him a quick look, but nobody says anything.  It's 
obviously not an appealing thought.

HIROKO
Where're they headed?

CASSIE
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's 
possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.

There's a great exhalation of breath, and everyone swaps significant 
glances. HIROKO seems worried.  She scratches her forehead.

HIROKO
I don't know what to make of this.  Get a copy of the telemetry relayed 
back to Antarctica Traffic Control.  Better alert the nearest RimCorp 
Base, too.

PARSONS nods, suddenly serious.

PARSONS
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?

HIROKO
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON

Down here in the swamp, the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in 
gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk, much like a Louisiana 
bayou.  A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for 
cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby.  Seconds later, 
a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes O.S. and a pair of manta-ray-shaped 
hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME 
suspended two feet above the mire, their powerful turbines kicking-up a 
swirl of spray.  The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES 
scatter.  ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called "good 'ol 
boys" - are both riding one-handed; powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in 
the other.

YORK   (yelling)
You missed 'em, Ackland!

ACKLAND
Little fuckers move too fast.  Let's do a sweep and catch 'em on the 
other side.

YORK nods his head, pulling his goggles down over his eyes.  The two 
bikes ROAR off in pursuit.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON

Up on a mud-bank, at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two 
blinking blue lights atop it, stands the camp.  It looks a little like 
a Bedouin bivouac, but up-close we can see the techno-fitted details.  
A hard-featured woman seated next to a solid-fuel burner sips from a 
mug, while her Vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large-caliber 
bullets into a belt-feed.  They 
watch as ACKLAND and YORK roar past WHOOPING.  MINH scrambles out of 
the way as a beer can lobbed by YORK CLATTERS to the ground near him. 

MINH
Crazy idiots.

BEAUVAIS cups her drink with both hands, assessing him.

BEAUVAIS
Ahhh, they're just letting off some steam; don't let 'em get to you.  
Ackland and York aren't such bad guys when you get to know 'em.  Just a 
couple of weekend warriors...

She peers curiously at the clunky cartridges MINH's thumbing into the 
belt feed.  On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over-
the-shoulder guidance mechanism.

BEAUVAIS (CONT'D)
Nice howitzer you've got there.

MINH
Thanks.

BEAUVAIS
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?

MINH
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the 
rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock 
you a month's pay for just mentioning it.

He peers into the belt and blows out some dirt.

MINH (CONT'D)
Sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it, 
though.

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

Against a sea of stars, a small metal shape HURTLES towards us, 
followed moments later by it's identical twin.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - AFTERNOON

A strand of HIROKO's hair falls forward into her face, slick with rain.  
She brushes up at the miserable weather.  She and KAMEN are standing on 
one of the twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage 
vehicle we saw outside the base earlier.  Up on the side of the cab is 
painted a Nordic Valkyrie with an impressive bustline, next to which is 
the legend 'BIG BERTHA'.  Two mechanics, JAN GUTTIEREZ and KEVIN 
DILLER, watch KAMEN point something out to HIROKO from the vantage 
point of KAMEN's crawler parked in the swamp nearby.

KAMEN
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the 
pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on 
these new plastics.

HIROKO
We haven't used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module.  
That was four months ago.  I can't ask for them to keep bringing spares 
in on the shuttle, it's already costing too much as it is.

KAMEN shrugs.

KAMEN
If you want these things kept in working condition, that's the only 
choice you've got.

DILLER leans in to murmur quietly to GUTTIEREZ.

DILLER
Maybe she wouldn't be so tetchy if she got laid every once-in-a-while.

GUTTIEREZ
You offering?

A buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF.  DILLER gets up to answer.

DILLER
Nah.  Freeze my dick off.

HIROKO shakes her head dubiously at KAMEN's comment.

HIROKO
I don't know.  I think we'll have to run it on a rota; one month down, 
one month operational.

DILLER leans out of the crawler's cab and calls across.

DILLER
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.

HIROKO
Thanks.

She turns back to KAMEN.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Let me sort this out and we'll go over the logistics in my office.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO peers at the display with undisguised concern.  A sense of 
urgency buzzes around the room.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
When?

CASSIE
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings 
are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too 
close for comfort.

HIROKO
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?

PARSONS looks up from his board in harassment.

PARSONS
Already working on it.

HIROKO
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.

She meets KAMEN's eyes.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Looks like you were right.  Someone's lobbed a pair of smart-missiles 
at us.

KAMEN shakes his head.

KAMEN
Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies; why bother?  
All you're gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control 
net.  That'd be small potatoes even for terrorists.

PARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board.

PARSONS
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?

CASSIE
Okay, give me the numbers.

She flips a switch.  A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path 
sketched out in rectangular neon blocks.

EXT.  SPACE

A cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites, 
and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move.

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

The two pods ROAR towards us at immense speed.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The two blips on the holo-board representing the pods make a marked 
alteration in their course.

PARSONS
They've changed their heading again.

HIROKO
Compensate!

PARSONS
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.

CASSIE
What do you need?

PARSONS
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.

CASSIE
It's on the board.

EXT.  SPACE

Framed against the green backdrop of Ryushi, the PREDATOR pods rocket 
towards the communications platform.

CASSIE
Picking up velocity.

HIROKO
Match it!

A bead of sweat trickles down PARSONS' temple.

PARSONS
Not gonna make it...

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

The pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY into CAMERA, blotting out our view.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

One of the two blips on the holo-display vanishes, and three-quarters 
of the monitors abruptly turn to static.  PARSONS curses.

PARSONS
Goddammit!

He pulls off his headset with weary resignation.

PARSONS (CONT'D)
We've lost the downlink.  It's gone.

EXT.  SPACE

The mass of the satellite tumbles end-over-end.  A gaping rent is torn  
through it; something sparks and flashes within.  The second pod 
accelerates off curving into the atmosphere.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK

A SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead; YORK looks up in time to see an 
object sear across the dusk sky.  He pulls his bike to a stationary 
hover.

YORK
Shit!  What's that?

ACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the 
ground.  A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest, followed by a few 
plaintive SCREECHES from the planet's indigenous lifeforms, before 
settling back into an eerie silence.

ACKLAND
Meteor, I guess.

He raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face.  THROUGH THEM 
he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops.

ACKLAND
D'you feel any impact shock?

YORK   (uncertain)
Not really.

He lowers the binoculars and frowns.

ACKLAND
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, 
and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.

YORK
Do you wanna head back and call it in?

ACKLAND   (hesitant)
I dunno... I dunno.  Something about this feels funny.

He looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky.

ACKLAND (CONT'D)
That is the damndest impact I've ever saw...

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK

The earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked; some of the 
surrounding brush still aflame.  A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively to 
the edge of the pit and stops, it's stinger twitching hesitantly.  We 
HEAR a LOW HUM, and the SOUND of METAL-ON-METAL.  Before the SCORPION 
can decide what to do, it's fate is sealed.  A large METAL CLAW comes 
down, crushing it in an instant.  A SECOND CLAW emerges, and a MACHINE 
heaves itself out of the hole, it's surface smoking with heat.  It 
pauses for a BEAT like some giant tarantula seeking prey, them moves 
purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting.  A hatch on the 
underside opens, and a complex delivery mechanism extends.  After a 
moment there's a LOW CLUNK, and the mechanism retracts.  In it's place 
is an ALIEN EGG.  The MACHINE crawls off, vanishing into the long 
reeds.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT

HIROKO sits on the front wheel of KAMEN's crawler, her knees pulled up 
to her chin, staring off into a thin mist that makes the night 
impenetrable.  Behind and above, the lights of the cranes and the 
communications array strobe on-and-off.  Above the bar on the main 
street is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact, emblazoned with 
the words "TORCHY'S".  The MUFFLED SOUNDS of MERRY-MAKING from within 
become momentarily louder, and HIROKO glances over to see it's 
pressure-door CRASH back, disgorging several drunken people. KAMEN 
follows them through.  He spots HIROKO and heads over.

KAMEN
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.

HIROKO
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.

KAMEN
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?

She shakes her head, and manages a smile.

HIROKO
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too 
crowded for me.

KAMEN
Not too much of the socializing type, then?

HIROKO
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.

KAMEN LAUGHS.  HIROKO is straight-faced.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary 
installations.

KAMEN
Is that a fact.

HIROKO
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and 
want to claw open a vacuum hatch.

KAMEN
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?

HIROKO
Four.

KAMEN
And before that?

HIROKO
Six month stint on Datus.

KAMEN
Only six?

HIROKO
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?

KAMEN
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.

HIROKO shrugs.  Thinks about it.

HIROKO
I don't know.  I guess I've just never found anywhere I really felt at 
home.

She hugs her knees again, and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease.  
KAMEN spots a square glass balanced on one of the tire's wide treads.

KAMEN
What is that?

HIROKO
Real man' drink.

She offers the glass to him.  He takes it and sniff cautiously.

KAMEN
Seltzer?

HIROKO
Want some?

KAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle.

KAMEN
I'll stick with my own.

He sits with her and stares into the darkness.

HIROKO
Any luck raising Ackland's party?

KAMEN
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain 
range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.

HIROKO
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.

KAMEN
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?

HIROKO
Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.

HIROKO takes a sip of her drink, her brow furrowing.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
This whole thing's got me spooked.

KAMEN hops off the wheel.

KAMEN
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone 
figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look-
see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find 
whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.

HIROKO
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?

KAMEN
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.

EXT.  SPACE

A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the 
incapacitated satellite, examining every section.  it comes to the rent 
torn through it, and pauses.

FROM THE SCANNER'S P.O.V., we see the structure of the satellite made 
up from a series of blue geodesic shapes.  The damage registers as a 
cold, black mass.

The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly 
on it's axis, thrusting towards the planet. 

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT

Shafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness.  
YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds, cursing.

ACKLAND
Found anything?

YORK looks down at his data-stick, a handheld torch with a multi-
purpose readout screen.

YORK
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.

ACKLAND
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!

ACKLAND falls toward onto something, and YORK comes running.

YORK
What is it?

ACKLAND steadies himself, and the two men shine their torches at the 
rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground.

ACKLAND
It's a rhino.

YORK
Is it dead?

ACKLAND
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your 
stick's not broken.

YORK looks at the data-stick again.

YORK
Yeah, it's fine.

ACKLAND
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.

YORK
I told you we... what's that?

Their torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape.

ACKLAND
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?

YORK
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.

ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside.

YORK (CONT'D)
Careful...

There's nothing inside.  ACKLAND looks disappointed.

ACKLAND
It's hollow.  Think our rhino must've ate something that didn't agree 
with him.

A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a 
BANSHEE HOWL, ruffling their hair.

YORK
Let's get back and call this in.

ACKLAND
Wait a minute.

YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing 
foliage, coming out at the rim of the impact crater.  It's beginning to 
partially collapse, water seeping in.  YORK runs his beam over 
something at the bottom of the shallow pit.

YORK
What is that... is that metal fragments?

ACKLAND's maybe getting a little nervous now.

ACKLAND
This is very fucking weird.

He sees the churned earth, and the muddy trail leading off into the 
broken foliage.

ACKLAND (CONT'D)
It's like something came out of the crater and went that way...

There's a TINY CLICK, and ACKLAND looks over to see YORK taking the 
safety off his rifle.  ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders his too.  They 
step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to...

YORK
Another one?

ACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun.

ACKLAND
Yeah.  This's closed.

There's a CRACKLING NOISE, and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in 
four sections.  The two men jump back in alarm, and YORK LAUGHS 
nervously. Something organic is pulsing inside.  ACKLAND cranes his 
neck forward for a better look...

There's an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT.  A spindly shape with a long 
segmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND.  It's a 
FACEHUGGER.  ACKLAND trips backwards, caught off-balance.  His finger 
involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls.  A volley 
of shots describe and arc and  light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE 
BOOM, and we...

CUT TO
...A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.  SOMETHING is watching them 
from the trees; something with a heat-vision P.O.V.  A PREDATOR.  We 
see the flare of ACKLAND's gunshots, then SNAP IN to see the multi-
colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER, 
before we... 

CUT BACK TO
...One of ACKLAND's bullets taking a meaty chunk out of YORK's thigh as 
he races forward to help his friend.  The HUGGER's tail is already 
around ACKLAND's throat, it's fingers scrabbling for purchase.  YORK 
pulls at one set of digits, and manages to raise them for just an 
instant.  What we see is horrific; the look of terror on ACKLAND's 
face, and the questing tendril on
the HUGGER's underside trying to force it's way between ACKLAND's lips.  
In a second, it's all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK's 
grasp, and clamps itself firmly on ACKLAND's face with a faint SUCKING 
SOUND.  YORK shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few 
feet away.  He watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving 
altogether.

YORK
Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.

The FACEHUGGER's tail slithers tighter around ACKLAND's neck; and as 
YORK quickly retrieves his rifle, we...

CUT TO
A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the color-bloom of YORK dragging 
ACKLAND's body away from the crater.  It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, 
giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around 
the HUGGER and into ACKLAND.

YORK's limping badly, a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue 
trousers. ACKLAND's not a small man, and the physical effort of hauling 
him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely.  There's movement on 
the ground, and YORK sees why; one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to 
another FACEHUGGER, which dwarfs it's small furry body.  The HUGGER's 
fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens it's hold; the 
movement akin to somebody drumming their
fingers on a table-top.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT

As YORK hauls ACKLAND onto one of the bikes, he hears a TICKING SOUND 
from the trees, like an engine cooling on a warm summer's day.  YORK 
clutches his rifle and stares upward.  There seems to be a VAGUE 
SHIMMERING FORM in the bough of a tree.  Although it might be a trick 
of the light, he isn't sticking around to find out.  YORK guns the bike 
to life and ROARS off above the swamp.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT

PREDATOR-VISION.  
We're looking at the site in colours:  the cold blue of empty ALIEN 
EGGS, and the warm reds of just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the 
FACEHUGGER parasites.

A group of PREDATORS appear in three-dimensional solidity, their 
camouflage cloaks deactivated.  The LEAD PREDATOR SPLASHES across to 
the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an ANIMAL CORPSE 
curled up there.  Most of it has been madly mutilated by something 
erupting from inside it's body. The PREDATOR looks up and scans the 
swamp, ignoring the swarm of FLIES buzzing in the air.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
This time, an oscillating line appears to the left of our view, and a 
band sweeps quickly ACROSS the screen synchronous to us hearing 
different levels of SOUND STATIC.  This abruptly stops as the 
oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys.  The PREDATOR is 
picking up radio
waves.  A HUMAN VOICE; albeit grossly-distorted.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

We hear a RAPID BEEPING; movement-sensors set up on tripods to warn 
against intruding animals.  The sound brings BEAUVAIS out of her tent, 
bleary-eyed and fumbling with her pistol.  She's suddenly wide awake 
when she sees YORK's hover-bike, lit by the sensors' flashing red 
strobe.  It skids to a halt against a mud-bank, sending up a spray of 
silt.  YORK climbs off the bike and stumbles, then starts to unfasten 
the straps holding ACKLAND's body.

BEAUVAIS
Jesus Christ!  What happened?

YORK
Give me a hand with Ack.

She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up.

BEAUVAIS
How bad is... oh my God.

As ACKLAND is turned over, BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a 
FACEHUGGER. She shies away, repulsed. 

BEAUVAIS
What is that?

YORK
Don't... uuh... don't know.  Help me... uuh... help me get him inside.  
Shit!

YORK grits his teeth, but the leg injury is too painful.  He slumps 
slowly to the floor.

BEAUVAIS   (yelling)
Minh!  Minh, get out here!

INT.  TENT - NIGHT

A portable neon light in the tent flickers, casting staccato bluish 
light over ACKLAND and the FACEHUGGER.  MINH and BEAUVAIS stare at it 
in horrified fascination, while YORK pulls a tourniquet around his 
thigh.  He winces. 

BEAUVAIS
Have you tried prising it off?

YORK shakes his head.

YORK
I wanted to get him back here; get him back to base.

MINH
Forget it.  We lost the satellite link. It's dead.

There's a long pause while everyone considers the options.

BEAUVAIS
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.

MINH
Oh man...

YORK
Get real, Beauvais!  That thing might chew his fucking face off for all 
be know!

The motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again.  MINH catches BEAUVAIS' 
head-jerk.

BEAUVAIS
Minh...

MINH
Yep...

MINH hefts his 'howitzer' and leaves the tent.  BEAUVAIS rounds on 
YORK, continuing.

BEAUVAIS
How do you know it's not already?

YORK
I don't, but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look...

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

MINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of 
the camp, the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward.  He 
studies the surrounding darkness.  There's nothing out there.  He 
shakes his head in 
disgust.

MINH   (muttering)
Take a goddamn wrench to those things...

He thumbs a stud on the top of the 'howitzer'.  There's a gentle WHINE, 
and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the 
weapon up. It darts quickly to-and-fro; a mechanical snake seeking a 
target.  We see MINH's hand in CLOSE UP.  In addition to the firing 
trigger, there's also a thumb button.  He squeezes it...

The gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement, tracking 
something automatically.  There's a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off 
three shots in rapid succession.  Something that was only yards from 
MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole, a 
mass of luminous green liquid and motion.

MINH (CONT'D)  (dumbstruck)
God.

MINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a 
SPLASH, then lie motionless.  YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in 
an instant.

PREDATOR-VISION. 
Three humans; in motion and 'hot'.  The triangular mechanism of the 
PREDATOR's gun locks onto MINH.

A BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINH's body, 
spraying blood across YORK.  He topples dead to the ground, a look of 
pained surprise on his face.  BEAUVAIS is there immediately, racing 
across and scrabbling for the 'howitzer'.  She doesn't have time to 
take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger 
guard and starts squeezing off random shots.  The air shimmers as an 
unseen shape races at her.  There's a loud

SWISH of sliding metal, and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air.  
It SLAMS through BEAUVAIS' body, lifting her off the ground and 
impaling her against a tree.

YORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS' arms thrash around.  A moment later 
her struggles cease, and she'd dropped to the floor like a broken 
marionette. There's a CRACKLING SOUND, and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS 
disappears.  In it's place is a PREDATOR, a luminous green patch 
trickling from a wound on it's arm.  It's head flicks around as it 
zeroes-in on YORK, the three red dots of the PREDATOR's cannon 
following suit.  YORK's quick though, already up and running when the 
plasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg.

His options are limited.  The hover-bike is nearby.  He sprints for 
that and his luck holds...the key's still in the ignition.  He flips 
it.  The engine COUGHS and then dies.  YORK looks up.  The wounded 
PREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed.  YORK turns 
the key again, but the PREDATOR's almost upon him.  The creature WHIPS 
an ornately-shaped lance from it's back and thrusts it...JUST AS THE 
ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD!  The blade 
slices into the bike's body and jams there, while one of it's manta-
wings SMACKS into the PREDATOR's jaw, sending it reeling backwards into 
the swamp.

YORK swivels the bike on it's axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the 
rear, melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork.  He sees a PREDATOR 
handing from a tree, and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their 
camouflage nearby.  He's not sticking around to argue though.  YORK 
jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more 
cannon-blasts blossom around him.

The group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the 
area. The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses 
to the tent and opens the entry flap.

INT.  TENT - NIGHT

PREDATOR-VISION. 
The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on 
ACKLAND for a long moment, but takes no further action.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

We PAN SLOWLY ACROSS the deserted campsite.  There isn't a soul there, 
human or otherwise.  The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs. 

EXT.  RAINFOREST AIRSPACE - DAWN

First light the next day, the sun rising on the horizon.  A 'chopper' - 
actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist 
hanging over the treetops.

INT.  CHOPPER - DAWN

The cockpit is small, a two-seater with room for cargo in the back.  
KAMEN's in the pilot seat, and HIROKO's riding shotgun.  The controls 
moving by themselves, on autopilot.  A REPETITIVE BEEPING causes KAMEN 
to look up from his magazine.

KAMEN'S P.O.V.
From out of the window of the 'chopper', we see the twin blue lights of 
the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees.

KAMEN nudges HIROKO awake.

KAMEN
Wake up.  We're at the beacon.

He switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down.  
HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

Twin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep 
across the clearing.  The encampment has been wrecked, much of is 
reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris.  All-terrain gear lowers 
from the chopper, as it makes a watery landing in the swamp.

INT.  CHOPPER - DAWN

KAMEN and HIROKO stare at the site in disbelief.  KAMEN hauls an 
automatic pulse-rifle from the rear. 

KAMEN
Looks like trouble.

KAMEN reaches under the pilot's seat and pulls out a hand-pistol.  
Passes it to her.

KAMEN (CONT'D)
Used one of these before?

HIROKO coolly examines it.

HIROKO
Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses twelve mill hollow 'O' 
rounds, with through the barrel smart laser-sighting. Sure, I can 
handle this.

HIROKO's show-boating and KAMEN knows it, but he still can't help being 
a little bit impressed.

KAMEN
Okay.  Watch were you point it...

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

The two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred 
canvas. Part of the bivouac has collapsed - one of the guide ropes has 
burned through.

HIROKO   (quietly)
Somebody picked an argument.

KAMEN
Yeah.  Somebody won.

HIROKO
Check out the tent.

KAMEN nods and heads off that way, while HIROKO carefully inspects the 
wreckage dotted around the perimeter.

INT.  TENT - DAWN

KAMEN opens the tent flap and peers inside.  ACKLAND's on the cot, 
sweating heavily.  There is no sign of the FACEHUGGER.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

Across the clearing, HIROKO turns a piece of charred plating over in 
her hands before discarding it.

Her foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud.  It's MINH's 
'howitzer'. A dark slippery patch coats the metal.  She crouches down 
and rubs her fingers through it.  Blood.  KAMEN's VOICE intrudes, O.S.

KAMEN   (O.S.)
I've found Ackland!

HIROKO
Hold on...

She begins to cross the camp, and her foot catches on a taut length of 
rope. SOMETHING swings down from the trees, hitting her squarely in the 
face and knocking her off her feet.  HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and 
surprise, then freezes at what she sees.

Two bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead; BEAUVAIS 
and MINH.  Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition.  KAMEN 
hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant.  He stops 
in his tracks.

KAMEN
Jesus palomino...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - MORNING

It's raining again at the base.  Under cover of an overhang, HIROKO 
watches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the 'chopper' on a paramedic 
trolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA, an Indian woman in her late 
thirties.  As KAMEN slams the 'chopper's side door, we see that HIROKO 
has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat.  KAMEN runs after 
REVNA clutching a clear plastic bag.

KAMEN
Wait a minute, Doc...

He hands the bag over to REVNA.  She peers at the contents curiously.  
The FACEHUGGER is inside, stiff and shriveled. 

REVNA
Is this it?

KAMEN
Yeah.  Found it curled up in a corner of the tent.  Any idea?

REVNA shakes her head.

REVNA
Never come across one of these before. Maybe the original survey team 
did.  I'll run it through records and see what comes up.

GUTTIEREZ checks that ACKLAND's body's secure on the trolley.  KAMEN 
raps him on the back to get his attention.

KAMEN
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.

GUTTIEREZ
What's the problem?

KAMEN
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines 
might be playing up.

GUTTIEREZ
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.

KAMEN
Appreciate that.

REVNA interrupts.

REVNA
Where're the bodies?

HIROKO
Bagged and in the back.  They're not a pretty sight.

ACKLAND is wheeled into a freight elevator.  As KAMEN and HIROKO walk 
away across the rain-swept platform, a SHIMMERING FROM detaches itself 
from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli-jet pad. 

PREDATOR-VISION.
A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the towers and modules of the relay-
station with great interest.  An oscillating red line appears to the 
LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR analyses HIROKO's voice-pattern.

PREDATOR   (O.S., distorted)
Not a pretty sight.  Not a pretty sight...

He reaches down to his wrist computer and activates it.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DAY

Under the cathedral-like light filtering through the trees above, a row 
of metal spikes have been driven into the earth.  Four are topped with 
still-smoking ALIEN skulls.  Two and empty.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
A newly decapitated ALIEN head is turned around in another PREDATOR's 
hands in admiration.  This PREDATOR thrusts his trophy onto the next 
spike, then stares at the vacant one for a long moment.  His wrist 
computer BLEEPS for attention...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

With nothing to do, most of the screens are out and the remaining 
personnel bored.  PARSONS is reading a magazine with his feet up on the 
console, uninterested in HIROKO and KAMEN's conversation nearby. 

HIROKO
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with 
something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.

KAMEN
Agreed.

HIROKO
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.

KAMEN
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right 
now.

HIROKO
What do you mean?

URIOSTE walks up, very serious.  She interrupts.

URIOSTE
Sorry.  Can I have a word?

HIROKO
Sure.  What's up?

URIOSTE
Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago.  The algae must have clogged up an 
intake duct.

KAMEN
Think I spoke too soon...

HIROKO
Again?  How long before we start noticing the difference?

URIOSTE
I reckon it'll be another day before the smell gets unbearable.  
Beauvais usually fixes it, but... ah...

HIROKO knows what she means.  BEAUVAIS is dead.

HIROKO
Can you handle it?

URIOSTE
Sure, I can manage.  But I'm not going into the Pit on my own.

HIROKO   (to Urioste)
Alright, get somebody from the auto-shop.   (to Kamen)   Is that 
alright?

KAMEN
Yeah, no problem.  Ask Diller, he's good with his hands.

URIOSTE exchanges a grin with CASSIE.

CASSIE
I'll go along with that.

A SHRILL TRILLING from his console communicator makes PARSONS leap up 
to answer.

PARSONS
Parsons.   (long beat)   Yeah.  Hold on.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY

A CLOSE UP of an eye, bright blue and dilated.  DOC REVNA's shining a 
hand- held light into ACKLAND's face.  ACKLAND's regained 
consciousness, but is far from happy.  He's sitting on the edge of a 
cot in the base Infirmary, an antiseptic room full of automated medical 
equipment.  The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby, a 
circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting 
blades and surgical paraphernalia.

ACKLAND
Hey, c'mon Doc, I feel fine.  Really.

REVNA flicks off the probe.

REVNA
Headache?  Dehydration?

ACKLAND
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.

REVNA
Forget that.  I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours.  
I've got some toxin build-up tests still to run.

REVNA shakes her head and turns to KAMEN.

REVNA (CONT'D)
He's broken a fever that would kill a mule, but if he says he's alright 
I'm prepared to believe him.  He's all yours.

HIROKO enters.  She watches from behind KAMEN.

KAMEN
What happened out there, Ack?

ACKLAND   (consternated)
What do you mean, 'what happened'?  What am I doing back here?  Where's 
York?

HIROKO   (insistent)
What's the last thing you can remember?

ACKLAND thinks hard.

ACKLAND
We... watched a meteor hit over Linson's.

HIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances.

HIROKO
A meteor?

ACKLAND
Yeah, it impacted really off.  We went out to the crash-site... and... 
uh... that's... that's all.

KAMEN
Nothing else?

ACKLAND
No.

KAMEN turns to REVNA.

KAMEN
Show him 'Fido'.

REVNA pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack.  She 
hands it to ACKLAND.  He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside 
with morbid fascination.

REVNA
Ring any bells?

ACKLAND tries hard to think, but it's as if a wall's slammed down hard 
on his mind.

ACKLAND
Not really, no.  Ugly little sonuvabitch. What is it?

KAMEN
We thought you might be able to tell us. I found it by your cot at the 
camp.  You were out cold.

ACKLAND
What did York say?

HIROKO
York's vanished.

ACKLAND
Vanished?

HIROKO
Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland.  York's gone awol, unless you can 
help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion, he's the prime 
suspect right now.

The news hits ACKLAND hard.  He falters and leans back, addressing 
REVNA.

ACKLAND
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?

REVNA
Sure.

She goes to fetch a cup.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMISSARY

It's lunchtime, and the SOUND of machinery STEAMING food mixes with the 
CHATTER of the twenty-or-so personnel eating there.  HIROKO and KAMEN 
are deep in conversation across a table.

KAMEN
Do you believe him?

HIROKO
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on 
Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure.  
There's not much we can do out here.

KAMEN stares hard at her.  That's not much of an answer, and HIROKO 
knows it. She capitulates.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Alright then, For what it's worth... yes, I do.

KAMEN digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork.

KAMEN
You should try this seasoned stuff.  It's good.

GUTTIEREZ approaches the table carrying something.

GUTTIEREZ
Got a present for you.

He hands HIROKO's leather jacket over to her.

HIROKO
Oh, I've been looking for this!  Where was it?

GUTTIEREZ
You left it in the chopper.  Oh, and before I forget, Don?  I ran that 
test you wanted on the turbines.

KAMEN
And...?

GUTTIEREZ
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - AFTERNOON

A metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform.  DILLER leans 
against it down by the access ramp, smoking a cigarette and idly 
blowing rings into the air.  BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to 
quietly SNARL.  DILLER glances down at her curiously.

DILLER
What's the matter, girl?  You smell something?

Now the rhino are restless too.  CASSIE walks across the concrete 
roadway to join them.

CASSIE
Rhinos look a little antsy,

BREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING.

DILLER
Yeah.  Never seem 'em act like this before.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
CASSIE and DILLER are 'warm', but the rhinos are BREWSTER are 'hotter' 
still.  Their VOICES and BREWSTER's BARKS are filtered to the point of 
unrecognizability, eerily distorted.

CASSIE's the first to hear the SOUND.

CASSIE
Do you hear that?

DILLER straightens up, looking out into the surrounding trees.  It's a 
FAINT HUM, getting LOUDER every second.

DILLER
Yeah...

A hoverbike appears, trailing smoke from one of it's turbine intakes as 
it hurtles towards the base.  Halfway between the trees and the ramp, 
it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end.  It's rider flies through 
the air and hits the swamp face-first.  DILLER and CASSIE race down the 
ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead.

CASSIE
I don't believe it.

DILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the 
mire. It's YORK.  Blood has caked around his wounded leg.

DILLER
He looks in a bad way.  Help me get him up to Infirmary.

CASSIE
Wait a minute...

Something else has caught CASSIE's eye.  A "something" almost two 
metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike.  
Grasping the haft firmly, she works it free.  CASSIE examines the 
PREDATOR spear, and slowly shakes her head.

CASSIE (CONT'D)
Holy Mary...

PREDATOR-VISION.
The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the 
weapon over in her hands.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY

REVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope.  Every so often she 
GRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal.  
The stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of 
the computer screen.  The Infirmary is very quiet, and only the gentle 
THROB of the air-conditioning intrudes.  ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably 
on his cot.  He finally sits up and massages his chest.

ACKLAND
Oh.  Oh God...

REVNA lowers her pen and looks across.

REVNA
What is it?

ACKLAND
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.

REVNA
Do you want a tablet?

ACKLAND winces in pain.  His breathing's getting heavy.  He nods.

ACKLAND
Uh-huh.

REVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy.  ACKLAND's 
beginning to COUGH now.

REVNA
That sounds nasty.  I'll give you a couple of Demazine.

ACKLAND nods again.  His COUGHING has deepened, and now he's banging 
his chest with a balled fist.  REVNA hurries over with three red 
tablets and a disposable cup of water.  ACKLAND takes them gratefully 
and gulps them down. The effect is almost immediate; ACKLAND quietens 
and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips.

REVNA (CONT'D)
Better?

ACKLAND
Yeah...

Before he has a chance to elaborate, ACKLAND COUGHS once more.  A thin 
spray of blood and saliva dots REVNA's white smock and speckles her 
cheek. ACKLAND's scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to 
hyperventilate. She pulls away, dragging him from the bed in the 
process.  He falls to the floor, his MOANS growing in volume.

REVNA
Hold on, it's alright.  I'm gonna give  you a shot...

Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical 
instruments. She finds a pneumatic spray-injector, fully charged with a 
vial of amber liquid attached.  ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto 
the floor, his hands clawing at the air.  REVNA fumbles with the 
injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm.  ACKLAND 
convulses once then goes still, his eyes staring fixedly at the 
ceiling.  The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again.

We hear a gentle CRACKING, like twigs being snapped.  REVNA watches in 
horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across 
the floor from below ACKLAND's corpse.  REVNA shudders as the body 
moves a little, then is rolled over by something underneath it.

WHAT SHE SEES.  ACKLAND's body slumps forward onto it's front, 
revealing a gaping cavity in his back.  Bits of spine and ribcage are 
just visible.  A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform 
- pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from it's body with a pair of 
still-underdeveloped arms.

Around it's head is a distinctive nascent crest.  It kicks away from 
ACKLAND with a powerful push from it's legs, quickly gaining balance.  
After a moment appraising it's new environment, it stalks off behind a 
table.  REVNA thinks quickly.  She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red 
stud next to the pressure-door, which promptly RUMBLES closed.

The room is bathed in pools of shadows.  Plenty of hiding space for the 
creature.  REVNA hears breaking glass, making her start.  She 
cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of 
probe-arms. 

There's a wicked looking blade there, the kind used in major surgery.  
REVNA reaches up and twists the base; it detaches easily.  Now she's 
armed. Stooped over, she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER...

There's a flurry of movement, and suddenly the hunter becomes the 
hunted. The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL 
SHRIEK, and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense.  We 
hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY CORRIDOR

HIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary.  DILLER, 
CASSIE, and a few others are crowded around outside.  YORK lays 
unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door, making 
access difficult.  Above them, a hinged flap on the wall lies open 
revealing a circular mechanism beneath.  BREWSTER scratches at the 
bulkhead and WHINES.  MUFFLED THUMPS come from within.

HIROKO
What happened?

DILLER
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.

HIROKO   (astonished)
York...

HIROKO leans over to examine him, but a particularly loud CRASH from 
within the Infirmary distracts her.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
What's going on?

CASSIE
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds 
like Ackland's going nuts.

HIROKO
Force the door.

DILLER
Can't.  It's pressure sealed.

GUTTIEREZ races up and hands DILLER a wrench with a shaped tip.

GUTTIEREZ
Here...

DILLER
Thanks.

He inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard, the physical 
effort showing on his face.  The door grinds open about eight inches... 

The bloodied CHESTBURSTER forces itself through the narrow gap, HISSING 
vehemently.  Yellow fluid wells from a wound in it's crested skull, 
dissolving everything it comes into contact with.  The small group 
gathered around fall back in panic, jarring YORK's trolley and knocking 
HIROKO to the floor.  BREWSTER BARKS at the CHESTBURSTER, which tenses 
as if to leap.
DILLER brings the wrench down, but the CHESTBURSTER evades his blow and 
takes flight.  It strikes at HIROKO, who reflexively draws her head 
back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek.  
The ALIEN disappears down the corridor, leaving a trail of smeared 
blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring.  
GUTTIEREZ bends down and
helps HIROKO to her feet.  Shocked, she MUTTERS something to herself in 
JAPANESE, and regains some of her composure.

HIROKO
Get after it, don't let it get away!

DILLER stands there with the metal bar.  Does she think he's nuts?

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Go on!

This galvanises DILLER.  He races off in pursuit.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jan, give me a hand over here.

HIROKO AND GUTTIEREZ try to force the door, but DILLER was right - it 
won't budge.  HIROKO slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around 
blindly.  She must have hit the control knob, because the door slides 
back.  CASSIE looks inside.

CASSIE
Oh my God...

She turns away and retches.  HIROKO steps through and goes pale.  There 
are blood-smears over everything, and it's all GUTTIEREZ can do to stop 
BREWSTER from getting in there.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS' finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics 
displayed on a suspended glass screen.

PARSONS
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...

HIROKO
What is that?

DILLER
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating 
ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.

HIROKO
Where does that lead to?

PARSONS
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed 
out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked-
out.

HIROKO
You've checked that end?

GUTTIEREZ
Not yet, no.

HIROKO
Do it.  I don't want that thing on my installation.  I want it caught 
and destroyed.

KAMEN
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is 
basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off 
external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, 
we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That 
should give us ample time to find it.

HIROKO
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign 
a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it 
on the board.

CASSIE nods soberly.  HIROKO looks at everybody, and her words are 
carefully chosen.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
I don't care how you kill this thing, just be careful not to get in 
it's way when it bleeds.  You all saw what happened to Doc Revna.

There are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs.  
Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down 
with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.

DILLER
Okay.

HIROKO
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in 
itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a 
hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.

This seems to appeal to those assembled there.  There's a palpable buzz 
in the air.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Alright, let's get to it.  New York rules apply.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE

YORK is recounting his story to KAMEN and HIROKO in a hushed voice.  
Small beads of sweat stand out on his forehead and his eyes are haunted 
by remembrance.  The man's a mess.

YORK
...I mean, these... these mothers were... were huge.  They look like 
bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all over 'em.  
They must've wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds.  Minh got 
off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as well 
have been using a B-B gun.  I don't know how the hell I made it out of 
there alive.

He nods toward the PREDATOR spear in HIROKO's hands.

YORK (CONT'D)
The one I clipped with the hoverbike shoved that at me.  Whatever it's 
made of, it went straight through a double-layer of honeycomb polyalloy 
composite like it was butter.

YORK shakes his head in fear.

YORK (CONT'D)
I don't wanna ever come up against those things again.  Ever.

KAMEN claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him.

KAMEN
Don't worry about it, Yorkie.  You're safe now.  Go get come rest.

YORK nods.  He gets to his feet and leaves the room.  HIROKO waits 
until the door slides shut behind him.

HIROKO
So, what do you think?

KAMEN
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift 
their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the 
middle of something we shouldn't.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

It's late, and the base's exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light 
across the metal and concrete thoroughfares.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES - 
a tough-looking Afrikaan woman with a think accent - looks uneasily 
about them. Another GROUP of PEOPLE with trackers and guns are 
searching around in the BACKGROUND.  Nearby, the vertical yellow column 
of a suspension-crane gantry towers high above.

DE VRIES
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.

GUTTIEREZ
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more 
fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, 
and found zip.

DE VRIES
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?

GUTTIEREZ
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.

DE VRIES pauses, listening to the sound from the surrounding forest.

DE VRIES
Listen to that...

GUTTIEREZ cocks his head and listens.  He has no idea what she means.

GUTTIEREZ
Listen to what?

DE VRIES
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's 
unnatural.

GUTTIEREZ shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable 
blackness beyond the confines of the base.

GUTTIEREZ
De Vries?

DE VRIES
Yeah?

GUTTIEREZ
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.

BREWSTER the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the 
meshwork fence of their pens.  The animals move around in agitation.  
Not at her, but at something else...

DE VRIES
Something spooking the rhinos?

GUTTIEREZ
I dunno.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - DUSK

PREDATOR-VISION. 
The rhino's, the dog, and the two humans can be seen way above on the 
platform's edge, bright red.

Indistinct inside their camouflage cloaks, the small group of PREDATORS 
wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DARKNESS.  DILLER and URIOSTE's VOICES heard O.S. in HUSHED TONES.  The 
scraping of METAL-ON-METAL.

DILLER
What is that...is that it?

URIOSTE
No.  I... think that's a regulator valve. Hold on.

There's more NOISE.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Ah, got it...!

About a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber 
illuminate.  Three others flicker erratically, one of them remaining 
unlit. DILLER waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse-
rifle level. He enters, followed by URIOSTE.  She's carrying a portable 
- but bulky - piece of machinery.

URIOSTE
Are you getting anything?

DILLER   (sarcastic)
Yeah, eyestrain.  What's with the lights?

URIOSTE
They're always like that.  Head-Office are real cheap when it comes to 
spares.  Wave that thing in the corner...

DILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around.  The small screen registers 
nothing.

DILLER
The room's clean.

URIOSTE
Great.

URIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the 
floor.  It's heavy and thick with grease, but she doesn't seem to mind. 
Below it is what looks like a round metal plug.  Recessed into its 
surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve, with handholds on 
either side.  She turns the lever.  There's a loud CLUNK, and a plume 
of steam JETS out of the valve.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Give me a hand with this.

GRUNTING, the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit.  
Murky water sloshes around below.  URIOSTE pulls a second lever, and 
hidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Pass me over that tripod, will you?

Leaning against the wall behind DILLER is a sturdy metal tripod topped 
with a block-and-tackle arrangement.  A hook dangles below this, it's 
thick metal cabling going up through the block-and-tackle and 
connecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to 
the wall.  DILLER hands the tripod over to URIOSTE.  She splays the 
legs apart and inserts their tips into matching holes around the open 
pit.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES walk over to the rhino pen, BREWSTER pulling at 
her leash.  GUTTIEREZ frowns at what he sees.  All the rhinos are 
nervously huddled together in the far corner.

GUTTIEREZ
That's real peculiar behavior.

DE VRIES fingers a rough metal edge.

DE VRIES
Hey, Guttierez?

GUTTIEREZ
What?

DE VRIES
Take a look at this.

GUTTIEREZ moves over for a closer look.  There's a torn hole in the 
meshwork, just big enough for a rhino to squeeze through.  Blood and 
fragments of skin coat the edge of the gap.

GUTTIEREZ
One of 'em must have escaped.

DE VRIES
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking 
tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it 
up.

GUTTIEREZ shines the flashlight along the deck.  A trail of smeared 
blood runs all the way to the perimeter.  The surrounding fence has 
been buckled and twisted.  They cross to it and look down at the swamp.  
The torch beam sparkles on the murky water far below.

GUTTIEREZ
There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.

DE VRIES
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.

GUTTIEREZ
That's a fact.

GUTTIEREZ' tracker starts to BLEEP.  He raises it excitedly.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Whoa, wait a minute...

DE VRIES
What?

GUTTIEREZ
Just got a reading...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Most of the lights in Admin are off, and the room's deserted.  PARSONS 
is seated away from his usual station at a console topped by ten 
monitor screens, each displaying a securi-cam picture.  He looks tired.  
KAMEN comes up behind him carrying two mugs of coffee.

KAMEN
How's it going?

PARSONS
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.

He takes the coffee gratefully and sips at it.

PARSONS (CONT'D)
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now.  
Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.

KAMEN
You should hit the sack, too.

PARSONS
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.

KAMEN
What time's sundown?

PARSONS
'Bout five minutes.

KAMEN
Give me a yell is something happens.

PARSONS
You got it, cowboy.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ sweeps the tracker slowly around, and BREWSTER begins to 
gently SNARL.  
DE VRIES pulls on the dog's leash to quieten her.

GUTTIEREZ
It's up there somewhere...

He shoulders his rifle.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Come on.

A metal ladder runs up the side of one of the base buildings.  
GUTTIEREZ crosses to it and starts to climb the first few rungs.

DE VRIES
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?

GUTTIEREZ
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.

DE VRIES
Forget it, man.

GUTTIEREZ
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.

DE VRIES
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if 
it wasn't night.

GUTTIEREZ starts to climb the ladder.

DE VRIES
What the hell are you doing?

GUTTIEREZ
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.

DE VRIES runs her fingers through her hair in frustration.  Comes to a 
decision counter to what she wants to do...

DE VRIES
Wait a minute!

GUTTIEREZ stops climbing.

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
Alright, okay.  Look...

GUTTIEREZ
What?

DE VRIES
I'll come with you.

BREWSTER BARKS.  She drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties 
the leash around it.

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
But I'm going first...

GUTTIEREZ
Anything you say, Mammacitta.

She climbs around GUTTIEREZ and begins to ascend the ladder.  BREWSTER 
WHIMPERS and plaintively BARKS after them.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

The rooftop is dark, mysterious.  Pieces of retrofitted junk can be 
seen in silhouette, edged in light from way below.  DE VRIES and 
GUTTIEREZ carefully step over the threshold.  They speak in WHISPERS.

DE VRIES
Careful of that edging there...

GUTTIEREZ
Yeah, I got it.

Although we have an outstanding VIEW of the night lights of the base up 
here, the immediate gloom is impenetrable. 

DE VRIES
Where's that flashlight?

By way of an answer, a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air.  DE 
VRIES takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground.  Circular 
extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom.

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
Still got him?

GUTTIEREZ
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.

DE VRIES plays the flashlight across the rooftop.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Little bit further...

The beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus.  A short-
range antennae, about seven feet wide.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right there, right behind the antennae.  I think 
we're got it cornered...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with 
the roadway.  The broken grillework is melted outwards.  KAMEN and two 
other men - CALDWELL and THOMAS - stand behind.

THOMAS
The door to the food storage locker was smashed open.  It must have 
come straight out of here.

HIROKO yawns.

HIROKO
Alright.  Keep your eyes peeled.

She voices her concern to KAMEN.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
If it got out of the systems, it could be anywhere.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

It's very quiet, and we can hear the NERVOUS BREATHING of GUTTIEREZ and 
DE VRIES as they cautiously stalk forward.

GUTTIEREZ
Hold it, hold it...

DE VRIES
What's wrong?

GUTTIEREZ
I'm picking up another signal.

DE VRIES looks around, unnerved.

DE VRIES
What?  Where?

GUTTIEREZ
Just behind us, over to the right.

DE VRIES shines her beam over the surface of the yellow crane to their 
rear, shifting her attention to-and-fro from it and the antennae.

DE VRIES
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?

GUTTIEREZ
Yeah, I...

The second blip on the small screen abruptly vanishes.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Wait.  Lost it.

DE VRIES
How?

GUTTIEREZ
I dunno.  Might be a glitch.

From behind the metal disc there comes a SHUFFLING SOUND, followed by a 
METALLIC THUNK.  This gets their attention.  The two of them halt in 
their tracks.

DE VRIES
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!

GUTTIEREZ
It's alright, it's cool...

DE VRIES
Is it still moving?

GUTTIEREZ
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe.  
Nice and easy...

A small many-limbed SHAPE hurls itself from the confines of it's hiding 
place with a FERAL SHRIEK.  DE VRIES YELPS in surprise, and looses off 
a spray of bullets.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO looks up, startled by the sound of GUNFIRE.  She sees the 
rooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire.  BREWSTER's 
tethered nearby, BARKING furiously.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

A think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends URIOSTE in 
the gloom of the Pump Shaft.  In front of her is a machine-part we saw 
her carry earlier.  With the strap of a flashlight clenched in her 
mouth, she's just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of 
machinery in an alcove, with simultaneously doing her best not to touch 
the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge.

The REPORT of DE VRIES' weapon can be heard even down here, perhaps 
more startling in the confined space.  URIOSTE jumps, dropping the 
flashlight into the water in the process.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access 
tunnel leading outside.  URIOSTE's VOICE floats up out of the shaft. 

URIOSTE   (O.S., muffled)
What was that?

DILLER   (raising his voice)
Something outside...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

The wind whips at GUTTIEREZ as he blinks away his shock.

GUTTIEREZ
Holy shit...

DE VRIES keeps her torch beam on the moving shape.  It halts by the 
edge of the roof, and stares at them.

DE VRIES
Oh, nice going, man!  It was a lemur! A goddamn lemur!

GUTTIEREZ' radio headset CRACKLES to life.

HIROKO   (O.S., on headset)
Guttierez, what the hell's going on up there?

GUTTIEREZ
Uh... sorry about that, boss.  Everything's fine.  False alarm, that's 
all.

DE VRIES glances around the rooftop, annoyed.

DE VRIES
Hey, look; let's forget it.  There's nothing up here.

PREDATOR-VISION.  
DE VRIES in CLOSE-UP, glowing brightly.  Her VOICE replayed and 
distorted.

PREDATOR   (O.S.)
Nothing up here.  Nothing up here.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

URIOSTE's flashlight bobs up-and-down on the water below, still lit and 
well out of reach.

URIOSTE    (disgustedly)
Shit.

DILLER   (O.S., muffled)
What's the matter?

URIOSTE
I've dropped my torch into the water. Give me about... uh... a meter-
and-a-half's worth of slack.

DILLER   (O.S., muffled)
Okay.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER crosses to the wall-mounted winch.  On the mechanism's side is a 
luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters.  He 
pulls a throw-switch, and the display slowly changes from "8" to "9.5" 
as the cable feeds out.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

URIOSTE descends the dingy shaft, partially abseiling off the walls.  
Her feet almost tread water.  She's down as far as she can go.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)
Whoa, whoa...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

URIOSTE's VOICE echoes up out of the pit.

URIOSTE (CONT'D)  (O.S., muffled)
That's enough.

DILLER locks the winch-switch back into it's 'up' position.  The WHINE 
of the cable-feed stops immediately.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

URIOSTE stretches out to the floating lamp, flexing her fingers.  
It's... just... about... in... reach...

Six slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the water's surface and clamp 
like a vise around URIOSTE's wrist.  A sleek eyeless head follows, 
trailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare.  A SCREAM 
forms in her throat, rapidly cut-off as the ALIEN's other hand clamps 
firmly over her mouth, jerking her downwards.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below.  He sees the 
winch tripod above the shaft RATTLE, the cable going taut as an 
angler's line. The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps 
from it's 'clamped' position, freely unspooling cable at a frightening 
rate.  The digital counter flickers rapidly; 
"11...11.5...12...12.5...13..."  DILLER watches the tripod's tubular 
legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain.  He scrambles for 
the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place; the 
over-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the 
shaft's edge.  DILLER's moment of satisfaction is short-lived; the 
deep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by 
the colossal force from below.  He leaps aside, avoiding the heavy 
piece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him.  Watches it disappear 
noisily into the conduit.

DILLER
Annie!

DILLER's quivering fingers grope for his flashlight.

DILLER (CONT'D)
Annie!

He feverishly reaches the shaft's edge and peers into the darkness.

WHAT HE SEES.  The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the 
ALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft 
walls towards him.  Recoiling in horror, he makes a run for the door.  
Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor, 
grasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top.  DILLER fumbles with the 
safety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll, BLASTING it 
back into the pit.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES hear the gunfire from below.

GUTTIEREZ
The hell was that?

PREDATOR-VISION.  
The PREDATOR's gaze SNAPS away from the two humans and down onto the 
platform below.  He watches the infra-red shapes of other people 
running towards the source of the shots...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER's on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as ANOTHER 
ALIEN's claws emerge from the exposed hole.  He races across the 
threshold and SLAMS the thin inner door closed.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

In a HAND-HELD SHOT we're running with HIROKO's group along the narrow 
catwalk bridging the roadway to the Pump Room, KAMEN taking the lead.  
DILLER sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides 
with him. 

KAMEN
Kev, wha...?

DILLER breaks free of the other man's grasp.  He looks as if he's about 
to say something, but never gets the chance.

There's a sound of TEARING METAL, and a HISSING seven-foot express 
train of teeth and biomechanical limbs ERUPTS from the shadows.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - DUSK

PREDATOR-VISION.  
Gazing down at the platform, an unseen hunter watches the swift black 
SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the group of humans...

From the corner of her eye, DE VRIES sees something moving nearby.  She 
violently pulls GUTTIEREZ out of the path of the shimmering FORM that 
barges past them, launching itself from the rooftop. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed 
to his bank of screens by an exterior securi-cam. 

PARSONS
Oh my God...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

With superhuman strength, the ALIEN brutally back-hands DILLER, 
splintering his skull and killing him instantly.  His body caromes into 
THOMAS, knocking the man to the floor.  The ALIEN turns to KAMEN, it's 
questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the 
ground.  The space on the catwalk it limited; there's so many people 
it's impossible to get a clean 
shot...

HIROKO
Move!  Get out of the way!

HIROKO draws a bead on the ALIEN.  She flips off the safety on her 
rifle. It's the tiniest CLICK, but the ALIEN somehow senses danger.  
It's skeletal tail lashes out, sending both her and the weapon flying.  
CALDWELL gets in for his shot, but the tail's there in a second.  It 
strikes like a snake. Once.  Twice.  The stinger punctures CALDWELL's 
chest and throat.  Nobody could survive something like that...

The ALIEN flicks it's skull back around to KAMEN.  The man's head is 
inches away from it's eyeless face...a row of burnished metal teeth 
open...the toothed inner tongue ready to strike...

WHOOMPH.  Something lands heavily close-up, jarring the catwalk.  The 
ALIEN drops KAMEN and WHIRLS.  A spear wielded by an INVISIBLE FORM 
appears out of nowhere and PIERCES the ALIEN's midriff, spraying acidic 
fluid.  The creature emits a OUTRAGED SHRIEK and flails around, it's 
ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant.  The STINGER 
makes contact:  there's a SPUTTERING SOUND as the PREDATOR's cloaking 
device begins to flicker spasmodically, giving us peek-a-boo glimpses 
of it's natural form.  Electrical sparks dance around the PREDATOR's 
ruin wrist-computer, luminous green blood welling from a wound in his 
arm...

From out of the Pump Room comes more NOISE, like metal being trashed in 
a compactor.  HIROKO SCREAMS at KAMEN, who's COUGHING painfully next to 
the door panel.

HIROKO
Get the door!

KAMEN hastily slaps the 'close' button and both halves of the exterior 
pressure bulkhead RUMBLE together.  A SECOND ALIEN appears from the 
shadows within and prises it's fingers into the dwindling gap, 
struggling for purchase.  Despite the ALIEN's best efforts, the door 
motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid 
CLUNK.  MUFFLED POUNDING comes from the other side.

Nearby, THOMAS has retrieved CALDWELL's weapon in the heat of the fight 
and is bringing it to bear on the PREDATOR.  At the last possible 
moment HIROKO sees what he's about to do...

HIROKO
No!

Reflexively, she knocks the barrel away as THOMAS looses a volley of 
shots.

PREDATOR-VISION. 
The PREDATOR's speech analyser plays back her vocal patterns as white-
hot bullets sear the night.

PREDATOR
No!

PREDATOR-VISION.  
SNAPPING IN for a closer look at her.

PREDATOR (CONT'D)
No!

One of the ALIEN's hands clamps firmly onto the PREDATOR's mask and 
wrenches it off.  HIROKO stares at the PREDATOR's face in fascination.  
From the distinctive features, we see that it's BROKEN TUSK.  The 
PREDATOR's good hand flashes down to his thigh, almost too quick to 
follow.  In one rapid movement a circular 'smart-weapon' is brought up, 
slicing the front of the ALIEN skull away from it's head.  In a feat of 
strength, the PREDATOR lifts his opponent's corpse on the end of the 
spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing...

Not wasting a second, BROKEN TUSK performs an almost-vertical bound of 
some twenty feet with astounding grace.  He grips a pipe running down 
the side of one of the building modules, then clambers over the roof's 
edge and finally disappears from view.  BREWSTER continues to BARK 
frenetically. 

HIROKO's headset has been knocked to the floor and a FRANTIC MUTED 
VOICE is coming from it.  She picks it up, and presses the 'transmit' 
switch. 

HIROKO   (into headset)
It's alright, Rob...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS listens to HIROKO, suddenly wide awake.  The morning shifts are 
starting to filter in, and it's obvious to them something's wrong...

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speaker)
Everything's under control.  Wait a second.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

THOMAS is moving from DILLER to CALDWELL, checking them for signs of 
life. HIROKO catches his eye.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Well?

THOMAS shakes his head.  GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES race across the 
platform to join the stunned survivors of the skirmish.  GUTTIEREZ 
bends down by DILLER's body.  THOMAS lays a hand on GUTTIEREZ' arm.

THOMAS
Come on, man.  Leave it alone.

GUTTIEREZ
Oh, God.  Dear Lord Jesus...

DE VRIES
This is like a bad dream, man.  A bad fucking dream.

HIROKO thinks quickly, and comes to a decision.  She speaks into her 
radio headset.

HIROKO
Rob?  I want you to evac everybody from the non-connective modules into 
admin. That goes double for anybody...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO (CONT'D)  (O.S., on speaker)
...already out here.  We're going to lock every bulkhead and seal the 
base.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO turns her headset off and watches numerous rotating coloured 
lights dotted around the platform start to blink on-and-off.  KAMEN 
COUGHS a few more times.

HIROKO
Are you okay?

KAMEN rubs his throat.  He nods.

KAMEN
I'll survive.

BREWSTER's BARKS cease, replaced instead with a TERRIFIED LOW WHINING.

DE VRIES
What's with the dog?

GUTTIEREZ jogs over to BREWSTER.  Lowers his rifle to the ground and 
fumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe.

GUTTIEREZ
Hey; c'mon now, girl.  It's alright.  Let's just get this knot 
undone...

A spray of plastic shards EXPLODES not three feet away from GUTTIEREZ.  
The rifle goes skittering away out of reach, and he scrambles away as 
an ALIEN half-pulls itself out of the sewer overflow, wet and 
glistening...

KAMEN
Jan!

BREWSTER's a mass of fur, totally out of control.  When the ALIEN 
lashes out to grab the HOWLING animal, there's nothing GUTTIEREZ can 
do.  BREWSTER's legs are the last thing we see, thrashing helplessly as 
she's dragged down into the splinter-edged gap.

DE VRIES
Get out of there, man!

THOMAS grabs CALDWELL's rifle from the deck.  He races towards 
GUTTIEREZ, with 
DE VRIES close behind... 

THOMAS
Catch this!

From behind comes the SOUND of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid 
limbs struggle up out of newly-broken ducts.  THOMAS heaves the rifle 
over the heads of the emerging ALIENS.  Although GUTTIEREZ snags it 
awkwardly, he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures.

GUTTIEREZ
Chew on this!

DE VRIES races up to join them, SCREAMING as she fires.  KAMEN glances 
down at this tracker's tiny screen.  It shows clusters of signals, lots 
of them.

KAMEN   (hollering)
They're all around, they're in the drainage system!

DE VRIES reacts swiftly, loosing a round of shots at the emerging 
ALIENS. GUTTIEREZ yells across to KAMEN.

GUTTIEREZ
Get your ass out of here, boss!

ALIENS are appearing everywhere.  From the overflow ducts; over the 
platform edges; along overhead cable supports.  Having taken on the 
genetic characteristics of their hosts, many of them are non-humanoid.  
All of them are living nightmares.

HIROKO
Oh my God...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - LIVING QUARTERS

CASSIE brushes her teeth in front of the wall-mounted mirror of her 
tiny bathroom-cubicle.  A raucous emergency klaxon GOES OFF in the 
corridor outside.

CASSIE
Shit.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

THOMAS, GUTTIEREZ, and DE VRIES are cut-off.  As they race swiftly down 
the street, GUTTIEREZ tries hard to interpret his tracker's signals.  A 
particularly loud BLEEP registers from a source immediately behind 
them.  He glances over his shoulder and sees an ALIEN crawling down the 
outside of a module towards them.

GUTTIEREZ
De Vries!

DE VRIES' head turns.  She sees the ALIEN and nails it with a rapid 
burst. It falls onto the concrete nearby, writhing in it's death 
throes. 

The group round the corner of a building.  Across the street from them 
is parked KAMEN's crawler.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
Inside, inside!

They scramble up into the cab.  GUTTIEREZ throws himself into the 
driver's seat.  An ALIEN sprints at the crawler with bared teeth.  
THOMAS looses a shot, blasting it backward into a Pepsi sign.

THOMAS
Yo' momma, boneface!

DE VRIES   (to Guttierez)
C'mon, man; punch this cow!

GUTTIEREZ fumbles at the ignition.  They keys are there.  He flips 
them, and the engine GROWLS to life.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - DUSK

PREDATOR-VISION.
From way up here, we've got an outstanding view of the humans running 
across the platform...

Crouching on a bright-yellow catwalk, BROKEN TUSK presses closed a 
panel on the small container balanced on his knee.  Inside it are rows 
of metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them.  
BROKEN TUSK flexes his hand experimentally.  Satisfied, he clips the 
medical kit onto his back before getting to his feet.

Standing around him are several other PREDATORS.  All but one have 
their camouflage cloaks activated.  The SOUND of GUNFIRE way across the 
station draws their attention...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

HIROKO and KAMEN bolt towards an external hatch, with KAMEN laying down 
a field of covering fire on full-automatic.  The blaze of light from 
the rifle's barrel abruptly stops.

HIROKO
What?

KAMEN
I'm out of ammo.  Get inside, get inside!

HIROKO hears a HORRIBLE NOISE nearby.  A field of cows being 
slaughtered by machetes would sound like this.

HIROKO
They're in with the rhino!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - RHINO PEN - DUSK

An ALIEN is SMASHED sideways into the one solid wall of the pen, 
broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of FRENZIED rhino.  It's 
yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped, eliciting ANGUISHED 
BELLOWS of pain from the hapless creature.

ALIEN stingers slice through the air.  Rhinos try to bolt but are 
intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces.  It's wholesale carnage.

PREDATOR-VISION.
We're moving swiftly along the rooftops and surveying the melee below, 
lessening the distance with each second...

Several indefinable FIGURES plunge into the fray, creating anarchy 
within the ALIENS' ranks.  The biomechanoids HISS with fury as the 
PREDATORS join battle against them...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

An ALIEN hurls itself through the air and onto the speeding crawler's 
roof.

INT.  CRAWLER - DUSK

KER-CHUNK!  The cab's occupants react as the thin roof buckles 
slightly. Skeletal fingers SLICE through, RIPPING at the metal like a 
can-opener.

DE VRIES
Jesus!

THOMAS raises his rifle and looses a fusillade of shots through the 
roof. One of them RICOCHETS off the interior, SHATTERING the 
windscreen.  There's a THUMP from outside...

DE VRIES (CONT'D)
You got 'im!

Their triumph is short-lived.  Globules of yellow acid perforate the 
roof like Swiss cheese, dripping down on them.  GUTTIEREZ floors the 
brakes.  The crawler swings through ninety degrees before SCREECHING to 
a halt. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE enters admin at a run.  Before, it was empty.  Now it's sheer 
chaos. She shoves her way through dozens of grim-faced people.  PARSONS 
is standing at a console, YELLING into his headset.

PARSONS
Seal everything now!

CASSIE
What's happening?

PARSONS
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.

CASSIE
We're what!?

York races in, SHOUTING above the clamor.

YORK
The son-of-bitches got into 'E' wing! They're ripping it apart!

PARSONS
Fuck!  Somebody get over there with some guns!  Now!

CASSIE watches the scene unfolding on the banks of monitors.  PEOPLE 
mouthing unheard words into camera.  Bursts of STATIC.  Fleeting 
glimpses of nightmarish SHAPES darting across the picture...

CASSIE
How many of them are there?

PARSONS
Too many.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

GUTTIEREZ' group hurriedly exits the crawler.  A cloud of acrid smoke 
rapidly fills the cabin.

DE VRIES   (coughing)
Move it, man!

The dead ALIEN's corpse tumbles through the acid-eaten hole, falling 
into the cab's rear seat and promptly burning through that as well. Not 
far away across the platform, the massive doors to the auto-shop hanger 
are RUMBLING slowly closed...

GUTTIEREZ   (shouting)
Hold the doors, hold the doors!

They don't hear him.  The doors seal with a BOOM of finality.

DE VRIES
Over there, on the right!

THOMAS sees the two ALIENS nimbly climbing the platform's edge.  He 
squeezes off about five shots, managing to kill the FIRST ALIEN...

THOMAS
These bastards ain't so tough!

***************************

THOMAS looks concernedly at GUTTIEREZ.

THOMAS
Is that thing working?

GUTTIEREZ takes off the headset and scrutinises it closely.

GUTTIEREZ
Shit!  The casing's cracked!

DE VRIES rips her headset off and urgently passes it to him.

DE VRIES
Use mine.  Channel twenty-six.


EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

Despite their ferocity and weapons, it's clear that the small group of 
PREDATORS are being overrun by the ALIEN horde. 

BROKEN TUSK's shoulder cannon swivels automatically, blowing away 
another attacker.  Hearing a distinctive SCREAM, he looks across the 
platform.  One of the PREDATORS, it's camouflage cloak flickering 
intermittently, is trying to resist being dragged down into a duct.  
The two ALIENS in either side plunge their tail-stingers into the 
PREDATOR's body, making it CRY OUT in agony.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS

Pumped up with adrenalin, KAMEN reaches an intersection and encounters 
a harrowing tableau.  An ALIEN blocks his way on the other side of a 
corridor bulkhead, holding a STRUGGLING MAN above the floor.  It's 
piston-like tongue shoots into the MAN's skull, spraying gore.

The ALIEN sees KAMEN, and it's mouth twists into a bloody SNARL.  Both 
KAMEN and the ALIEN lunge forward together, but KAMEN's got the edge by 
a split-second.  He STRIKES a bright red switch and the overhead 
pressure bulkhead SLAMS down and locks into place.  His breathing is 
heavy as he slowly backs away from the hatch...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

The two ALIENS THOMAS killed must have been the scout party.  Others 
appear, more cautiously this time...

DE VRIES
Hurry up and figure that thing out, man!

GUTTIEREZ is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic 
microswitches on the headset with his fingernails.

GUTTIEREZ
What?

THOMAS
We've got company!

THOMAS brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger.  He gets off 
one shot, then nothing more happens.  He looks at the counter on the 
side.  It reads 'zero'.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
Shit, I'm dry!  You're up!

DE VRIES raises her rifle.  She aims, and...

CLICK.

DE VRIES
I'm jammed!

THOMAS
You're what?!

She works the manual slide.

DE VRIES
It's locked solid...

THOMAS
Quick, give me the clip!

DE VRIES fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle.  It falls from her 
hands onto a plastic overflow grate.  THOMAS leaps after it...about a 
second too late.  It slips through the narrow gap, gone for good.

THOMAS (CONT'D)
Oh, Lord!  Please, no!  Not now!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE

HIROKO enters her office at a run.  She crosses to an inset control box 
on the far wall and presses a button.  Two exterior panels begin to 
slide closed behind the polycarbonate window.

KERSMASH!  Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes 
under assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIEN's tail.  In shock, 
HIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor, scrambling away.  
She watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge 
outside, fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously 
raining repeated blows on the window with it's tail.

The ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the 
onslaught, showering splinters across the room.  The twin shutters 
secure behind it, closing on the creatures tail in the process.  It 
HISSES in indignation and thrashes about.  Like a lizard, the segmented 
tail SNAPS in two.  The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining 
balance, blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden 
floorboards.  It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction, an 
unstoppable killing machine...

HIROKO
Holo on!

Her VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic, it's a wonder the 
computer can recognize it.  FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear, 
forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN.  The ALIEN halts, 
confused by this intrusion. It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms, 
bewildered by the lack of contact as it's claws pass through them.

Gaining on a few seconds of bought time, HIROKO flings herself towards 
the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby.  The ALIEN locks in on this 
sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her.  HIROKO 
GRUNTS, swinging the spear with her full strength...

She's no super-athlete, but the cutting edge's advanced metallurgy does 
the job.  It slices half-way through the ALIEN's skull and sticks 
there, spewing yellow fluid everywhere.  HIROKO beats a hasty retreat 
as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor, fumbling at the lodged 
weapon...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS

HIROKO reels into the outside corridor.  She SHRIEKS as her shoulders 
are seized from behind...

KAMEN
Come on!

HIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor.

HIROKO
That's the wrong way!

KAMEN
Detour.  Other way's blocked...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

Back outside, the ALIENS have sensed that something's amiss.  DE VRIES 
turns desperately to GUTTIEREZ.

DE VRIES
You got any slugs left?

GUTTIEREZ looks down at the counter on his slung weapon.

GUTTIEREZ
Yeah.  Uh...

DE VRIES rips the weapon off his shoulder.  GUTTIEREZ completes his 
sentence.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
...Seven.

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  DE VRIES tries to make each shot count.  She 
sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical 
storage containers. Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires...

A molten ball EXPLODES outward, transforming the immediate vicinity 
into a blazing inferno.  The ALIEN's body twists end-over-end, 
remaining immobile as it hits the deck.  A curtain of fire ripples 
across the platform...

THOMAS
Yes!

Their victory is short-lived.  The other ALIENS crawl cautiously 
forward, flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed.  We can 
clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws.

DE VRIES
Try again, man...

The headset in GUTTIEREZ' hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct 
channel. He YELLS into it...

GUTTIEREZ
Matt!  Open these damn doors right now, I'll ream your ass so bad these 
things out here'll seem like the Easter Bunny in comparison!  Swear to 
God!

THOMAS turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal.

THOMAS
Open the doors!  Open the goddamned fucking doors!

BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  CLICK.  GUTTIEREZ' bullets are gone.

DE VRIES
That's it!  We're dead!

The first of the ALIENS rushes at them.  This is the end.  DE VRIES 
SCREAMS...

There's a blinding flash, and most of the ALIEN's head vaporises.  
GUTTIEREZ blinks is disbelief as hazy SHAPES comprised of refracted 
fire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the HUMAN and ALIEN 
antagonists.  Intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi-
tech PREDATOR weaponry far in advance of the humans' sears the air...

GUTTIEREZ turns at the SOUND of the huge metal doors GRINDING slowly 
open. Just enough for them to get through.

GUTTIEREZ
Move!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

THOMAS pushes DE VRIES through the opening, with GUTTIEREZ hurriedly 
following.

The Auto-shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one 
wall. The front of a crawler pokes from one of them, while in the 
center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance-pit on 
a hydraulic platform.  A handful of GREASE MONKEYS stands around the 
doorway, brandishing power-tools in lieu of firearms.  A blonde surfer-
type with long straggly
hair rushes over to them.  This is MATT, their savior.

MATT
Close it up, close it up!

GUTTIEREZ stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up.  
In the midst of the flames, the ALIENS are fighting a pitched battle 
tooth-and-nail with their unseen opponents.  It's like a scene out of 
Hell.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS

Clusters of rotating emergency lights wig-wag above HIROKO and KAMEN as 
they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the Command 
Center.  KAMEN is falling behind as they approach a junction.

HIROKO
Hurry it up.

KAMEN
Don't wait for me!

HIROKO and KAMEN race along the final corridor leading to the Command 
Center. Halfway down, KAMEN turns in response to a JARRING SOUND from 
the rear.  The metal grating making up the floor is SMASHED violently 
from beneath.

KAMEN
Run!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The PANDEMONIUM from the outside corridors gets the attention of YORK 
and everybody else in admin.  He crosses to the bulkhead doorframe, and 
what he sees makes his eyes bug.

YORK
Jesus Christ!

He SHOUTS back into the crowded room.

YORK (CONT'D)
They're inside, inside the corridor!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR

HIROKO and KAMEN try to outrun the tidal wave of twisted and broken 
steel that emerges in their wake.  KAMEN YELLS with fright as an ALIEN 
claw pinions his ankle.  He trashes about, clutching at anything to 
prevent himself being dragged beneath the floor.  CRYING OUT is pain as 
slivers of edged metal slice into his hands...

HIROKO  (anguished)
No!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

YORK stands frozen at the bulkhead frame, staring down the corridor in 
horror.  CASSIE races up and pushes him out of the way...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR

HIROKO looks furiously around.  Spying an emergency axe in it's wall 
housing, she SMASHES the glass with her elbow, cutting herself in the 
process.  HIROKO hefts the heavy tool, swinging it down onto the 
disappearing ALIEN's carapace with all her might...

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Bastard!

The blade bites deep, and yellow blood bursts from the threshing 
ALIEN's wound.  Speckles of it dot KAMEN's leg, eating through the 
material of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath.  He 
SCREAMS, a sound of pure intense pain...

HIROKO hurls the axe aside.  She begins pulling KAMEN out of the hole 
as the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit.  
There's a SPARKING, followed by a FLASH and a SHEET OF FLAME.  CASSIE 
steps through into the corridor, just as valves evenly-spaced along the 
length of the tunnel open up, jetting white high-density foam under 
extreme pressure.  The hatch to the Command Center at the far end 
begins to close...

HIROKO
Cassie...!

CASSIE's head shoots around.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

YORK seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it 
into the narrowing divide.  CASSIE squeezes through the gap and 
urgently HOLLERS to HIROKO...

CASSIE
It you don't... uh!... move your ass, you're gonna need a helluva diet 
to get through here!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

from CASSIE's P.O.V. we watch HIROKO supporting KAMEN and stumbling him 
along.  Foam fills three-quarters of the corridor to their rear and is 
nearly up to their knees everywhere else.  The chair's frame CREAKS 
ominously in protest...

YORK
Hurry up, we're losing it!

CASSIE's eyes widen in terror...

CASSIE
Behind you!

HIROKO turns to see the long, phallic head of an ALIEN emerge 
momentarily from out of the foam.  Something yanks at KAMEN and he 
disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise...

HIROKO
Kamen!

HIROKO starts to thrash at the foam, but CASSIE reaches out and drags 
her away.

CASSIE
It's too late!

HIROKO
Nooooo!

The chair begins to buckle, collapsing in on itself...

YORK
It's going!

With a supreme effort, CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap.  YORK 
vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two, leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER 
closed. The two women collapse in a heap on the floor.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

The battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS.  There's only 
three of them left, and one is BROKEN TUSK.

A projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN, expanding in 
flight into a wire capture net.  Barbed tips on each corner bite into 
the wall of a base module, trapping the enraged creature.  Small motors 
WHINE as the thin metal pulls inward, slicing into the ALIEN's body...
 
The PREDATOR savors the scene for just a second...which is a second too 
long. ALIENS are all over him, clawing and ripping at his body.  The 
shoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and 
CLATTERS to the floor.

The PREDATOR goes down, groping for the self-destruct system on his 
wrist. He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar, but 
gets no further.  An ALIEN pounces at him, it's tail descending.  The 
PREDATOR raises his arm in reflex, but the stinger SMASHES straight 
through the buries it in his face-plate, taking out the wrist-computer 
in the process.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed 
disbelief.

PARSONS
Miss Noguchi?

No reaction.  He tries again.

PARSONS (CONT'D)
Miss Noguchi!

HIROKO snaps out of it.  She crosses over to the bank of monitoring 
screens.

HIROKO
What's the story?

PARSONS runs through each of the screens.

PARSONS
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', 
and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally 
evacuate.

HIROKO
How many... how many people are missing?

CASSIE
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over 
the place.

HIROKO
What's our weapons situation?

DRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly.

DRISCOLL
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We 
got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.

HIROKO
Auto-shop?

CASSIE
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.

HIROKO
Has anybody talked to them?

CASSIE
Not yet.

HIROKO
Do it.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK

BROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop in a 
bid to escape their unstoppable opponents.  Back-to-back, they take up 
fighting positions.  A few seconds later, the first of the ALIENS 
arrives.

Both the PREDATORS' shoulder cannons blaze, firing volley-after-volley. 
Still the ALIENS keep on coming, finally reaching the point where it's 
hand-to-hand...and nothing else.

It's a vicious, fast, and bloody on both sides.  BROKEN TUSK takes 
flight; his companion is not as lucky.  The other PREDATOR kicks an 
ALIEN from him and over the roof's edge.  The ALIEN lashes out with 
lightning-fast reflexes, pulling the PREDATOR with it.  Both creatures 
hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of 
the modules.  Caught like flies in a spider's web.  Both thrash about, 
severing cables as they do.  Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the 
air...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Everything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily, and 
the bank of monitors turn to static.  There's an instant of silence 
collective concerns amongst those gathered there.

DRISCOLL
What the hell...?

PARSONS
Don't panic, people.  We've just switched over to internals.

HIROKO
They knocked out the external feeds.

PARSONS
Looks like it.

CASSIE
Thirty six hours?

PARSONS nods.

PARSONS
Give or take.

CASSIE
We're not gonna make it, are we?

HIROKO
Get the auto-shop on-line.

PARSONS shakes his head.

PARSONS
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk.  
That's down with the other feeds.

HIROKO
Well... try the headset.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

Spirits are low in the auto-shop.

MATT
I'm tellin' you, it's impossible.  Nothing can grow and reproduce this 
fast.

THOMAS
Yeah.  Right.  You wanna go outside and tell them that?

DE VRIES
What's keeping those fucking Marines, man? They should'a been here by 
now!

THOMAS lashes out at an empty can, kicking it noisily across the floor.

THOMAS
Maybe they ain't coming.  Maybe they don't even know we've got 
problems...

GUTTIEREZ
I don't wanna hear that kind of crap, Thomas.  They're coming.  Just a 
matter of time, that's all...

GUTTIEREZ' headset lies nearby.  PARSONS muted VOICE comes out of it.  
One of the GREASE MONKEY's snatches it up and listens.

GREASE MONKEY
Yo!  Guttierez!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS
Through now.

HIROKO
Jan, it's Hiroko.  What sort of shape are you in down there?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speaker)
Pretty damn good shape, considering.  You can tell Don Kamen from me 
his people have got balls of steel.

HIROKO
Kamen didn't make it, Jan.

There's a pregnant PAUSE from the speakers.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jan?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Yeah.  I... we're still here.  We're all... uh... all sorry to hear 
that.

HIROKO
Can you make it back?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Uh... I'd say that was a negative.  If we open the doors, those things 
are gonna swarm inside.  There's another problem, too.

HIROKO
What's that?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
De Vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on 
the way in here.  Right now, the stuff sprayin' out is just burnin' up, 
but if we get a blow-back, a good part of the station could go with it.

CASSIE
Oh, man...

HIROKO
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... 
there's got to be a way out of this.

YORK
Oh yeah?  Like what?

YORK's kept quiet, but everyone turns to him now.  His tone is scathing 
and cuts to the marrow.

CASSIE
Well, what about those other things outside; those warriors?  Maybe we 
can cut some kind of deal...

YORK looks around at them in incredulous disbelief.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

MATT walks nervously around, holding the headset.  Everybody's eyes are 
on him.

MATT
Well, it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load 
the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.  That way we could put a 
bit of distance...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

MATT (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)
...Between us and the station.  Least 'till the guys from Fort Powell 
arrive.

HIROKO
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?

DRISCOLL
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for 
remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and 
running.

HIROKO
Which mean physically going outside.

DRISCOLL looks around uneasily.

DRISCOLL
Yeah.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK

A small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are 
clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor.  
HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream.  Across 
her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster.  She nods at a 
pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands.

HIROKO
Is this the suit?

DRISCOLL
Uh-huh.

She takes it from him.  Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls 
it up.  YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his 
face.

YORK
This is fuckin' lunacy!  You're not gonna make it across the platform 
on foot!

CASSIE
Shut up, York.

HIROKO
No, he's right.  Has anyone got a bike near here?

A REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly, then raises her voice.

REDHEADED GIRL
I have.

HIROKO
Let me have the keys.

The GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over.  HIROKO puts 
them in a pocket on the suit's sleeve.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Which one is it?

REDHEADED GIRL
Uh... the Hyundai racer.  Yellow and black stripes.

YORK
Oh, yeah.  Real inconspicuous...

HIROKO
Listen, I don't care if it's pink and purple polka-dots as long as it 
gets me there in one piece.  Somebody loan me a headset.

CASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over.  DRISCOLL's watching HIROKO 
fasten up the suit.  He spots a mistake.

DRISCOLL
No, go back.  Second clasp from the bottom.

HIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it.

HIROKO
How much air-time have I got?

CASSIE
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to 
admire the scenery.

HIROKO
Deal.

CASSIE
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into 
the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the 
inside of the glass as you go.

DRISCOLL
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the 
helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.

HIROKO
Sounds great.

PARSONS
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll 
be going in blind.

HIROKO
What?  Why?

DRISCOLL
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits 
you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around 
reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights 
would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down 
there oughta be enough to do the trick.

HIROKO
How tight are these shafts?

CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks.

CASSIE
Tight.  We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running 
into any Aliens.

HIROKO takes a deep breath.  Beads of perspiration dot her forehead.  
PARSONS nods.

PARSONS
There's still time to back-out.

HIROKO
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do 
myself.  Where's the disk?

PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet.

PARSONS
Don't lose it.

HIROKO slips it into a breast-pocket and secures the flap.

HIROKO
Don't worry.  I won't.

DRISCOLL hands several metallic objects to HIROKO.

DRISCOLL
Here.  If you got to use 'em, make 'em count.

They're magazines for her gun.  She slots them into the bandolier.

HIROKO
Thanks.

PARSONS
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it 
straight.

HIROKO
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and 
press the green enabling button...

PARSONS   (interrupting)
No.  There's two of them.

She pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place.

HIROKO
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...

PARSONS
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of 
there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke 
some kind of response.

YORK hands over a sophisticated-looking power-tool.

YORK
You'll need this for the gratings. Trigger finger to operate, thumb 
button to switch over to the rivet gun.  The sensors'll choose blade or 
socket heads automatically.

HIROKO
Right.   (long beat)   Okay, I'm set.

YORK and DRISCOLL lower the massive dome-fronted helmet over HIROKO's 
head. Auto-clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar.  
PARSONS clips the slimline air-tank to her back, and DRISCOLL makes the 
connections. 

PARSONS
Alright, let's open her up.  Carefully, now...

CASSIE and the others hold their weapons and motion-trackers steadily 
at a fixed point on the ground.  Two ONLOOKERS bend down to the 
pressure-hatch beneath the floor-grating.  It's identical to the one 
DILLER and URIOSTE removed earlier.  A plume of pressurised gas jets 
into the air, and they pull the metal sealing-plug free.  CASSIE 
scrutinizes her tracker...

CASSIE
All clear...

HIROKO reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one 
side.

HIROKO's P.O.V.
We're looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open 
shaft, braken water SLOSHING around it's rim.  Superimposed lines of 
glowing neon appear on the visor's surface, a precisely overlaid 
duplication of the scene in computer-graphic form.  A flatly-
synthesised male

COMPUTER VOICE comes over the helmet speakers, O.S.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Approaching 'A' module lower level venturiduct DS Oh-four...

HIROKO gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening.  
She stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension.  Tries to 
reassure herself.

HIROKO
Okay.  Okay.

She looks around at the impassive, staring faces.  Summoning up her 
courage, she submerges the helmet...

HIROKO'S P.O.V.
The pale illumination of the lower level deck-lights gives way to 
absolute nothingness; a stygian nightmare.  She SHUDDERS with horror 
and pulls her head free.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Oh...!  Oh, God...

She WIPES frenetically at the slickly-coated visor, breathing heavily. 
Worried hands grab her.

CASSIE
Are you alright?

PARSONS
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?

HIROKO's eyes dart around, speaking volumes.  She swallows hard and 
calms down.

HIROKO
It's alright.  I'm okay.

Steeling herself, she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into 
the water once more...

HIROKO's P.O.V.
Everything goes to blackness again.  The head-up-display presents a 
view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candy-apple hues.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Entering venturi duct, en route to secondary overflow sump DS oh four 
slash eleven...

YORK watches HIROKO's feet disappear into the shaft.

PARSONS
Seal it.

The heavy sealing-plug is dragged across the grating and positioned 
over the hole.  YORK shakes his head.

YORK
Suicide run, man.  Fuckin' suicide run.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT

CASSIE wasn't kidding about the venturi-duct.  It's only about half-
again as wide as HIROKO.  The only illumination comes from the hazy 
circle above.  As the plug reseals the hole, even that's gone.

Something flickers.  Two weak fluorescent tubes come on, lighting the 
murk with a faint orange haze.

CASSIE   (O.S. on speakers)
All the comforts of home.

HIROKO
Thanks, Cassie.

CASSIE   (O.S., on speakers)
Don't mention it.

She inches her way through the narrow space towards us, breathing 
heavily. The CLICKING of the motion-tracker in her helmet is 
overwhelming in the  silence...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ANTENNA ARRAY - NIGHT

The station's massive antenna array is being transformed.  Otherworldly 
shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to 
cover it's surface.  ALIENS drop from dizzying heights, exuding streams 
of gelatinous gunk from the four 'exhaust' pipes on their backs.  
They're building a nest of staggering proportions.

Unnoticed by the busy biomechanoids, faint sparks flicker from the 
crane catwalk high above...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

BROKEN TUSK sits on the catwalk floor, a small shower of sparks 
lighting his face.  He's attempting to repair his broken wrist computer 
with an intricate tool.  He removes it and presses a switch.  The 
display glows briefly, then fades.  He inserts it again.  Electrical 
sparks CRACKLE across the computer's fascia, before burning out.  
BROKEN TUSK throws the ruined machine away in disgust.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

From our P.O.V. high up near the roof of the auto-shop we see THOMAS 
sitting on the raised hydraulic platform.  He GRUNTS as he pulls a 
valve on the crawler's underside.

Across the room, the second crawler RUMBLES out of the far bay.  One of 
the GREASE MONKEYS walks slowly backwards, waving it on.

GREASE MONKEY
Okay.  Back.  Back.  Little bit more...

He steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing.

GREASE MONKEY (CONT'D)
Whoa...shit!

The man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the 
floor. Scowls first, then frowns.  It's sticky.

Over near the doors, MATT exhales deeply on a cigarette.  DE VRIES is 
nearby, listening attentively as GUTTIEREZ gets a message on his 
helmet.

GUTTIEREZ
She just set off!

MATT claps his hands together - just once - to get everybody's 
attention.

MATT
Okay, people.  Let's hustle...

There's a SCREAM from behind.  They wheel around in time to see the 
GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening.  THOMAS yells 
down from the platform.

THOMAS
They're comin' up through the pit!

A box with two large buttons - one green, one red - dangles from the 
ceiling on the end of a cable.  MATT forces down the red control, 
making the platform lower.  Several tons of machinery and crawler bring 
about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening, 
CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens.

An ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time, scrambling for the safety of the 
nearby shadows.  DE VRIES sights it.

DE VRIES
Over there!

One of the MEN has seen it.  His head snaps up to a mammoth engine-
block suspended from a winch high above.  He LEAPS for the release-
catch as the ALIEN passes underneath.  Pulls hard on the grip.  Chains 
RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down.  The ALIEN begins to look 
up, just a second too late.  The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into 
the creature, flattening it instantly.

Unseen by anybody, another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the 
platform-bound crawler.  It wraps it's long, bony fingers around the 
face of the MAN, stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck.  The 
LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets 
THOMAS' attention.

THOMAS
Mother-fucker!

THOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the 'on' switch hard.  The 
ALIEN's tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEY's skull, showering 
THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood.  The ALIEN discards the body 
and lunges at THOMAS, who counters bringing the chainsaw up.

The blade slices into the creature's throat, and up through it's head. 
THOMAS draws out the chainsaw quickly.  Something happens to the PITCH 
of the blade, a peculiar sound...

The acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band.  Like a metallic 
snake, it WHIPS off it's supporting frame.

Straight at THOMAS.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT

HIROKO elbows her way further through the cramped water-filled duct.  A 
wide grille directly in her path blocks further headway.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  Green neon flashes in her display, with accompanying 
notations.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Progress to secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven impeded.  
Grating must be removed to facilitate entry...

HIROKO   (into headset)
Okay, I'm at the first access grate.

CASSIE's VOICE is a little less clear now, with traces of STATIC 
drifting in...

CASSIE  (O.S., on speakers)
Copy that.  Be careful, now.

HIROKO
You betcha.

She places the tip of her power-tool over the first of the grille's 
anchoring bolts.  The complex mechanism WHINES as it selects the 
correct wrench-tip for the job...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS races up to the GIRL manning the communication console.

PARSONS
What is it?

GIRL
Auto-shop.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP- CRAWLER CABIN

THOMAS is laid-out in the back seat of the crawler's cab, with DE VRIES 
and MATT trying to staunch the wounds from the chainsaw band's impact 
to his chest.  GUTTIEREZ speaks into his headset mike.

GUTTIEREZ
Rob?  We got problems.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER

THUMP.  THUMP.  SLAM!  The grille in knocked out of it's housing and 
floats lazily off into the water.  HIROKO passes through the newly-
created hole.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
She finds herself in an upright cylindrical chamber, about five feet in 
height.  Massive extractor fans churn dangerously where both the floor 
and ceiling ought to be.  Kicking up a swirl of particles.  Pale blue 
light filters down from above.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Caution!  Entering secondary overflow sump DS oh-four slash eleven.  
Grating must be removed to facilitate entry to Central Reservoir...

HIROKO   (annoyed)
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

With difficulty, she straddles the floor turbine.  A vortex of water 
swirls around her as she brings the power-tool up once more.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS listens attentively.  He CLICKS his fingers at CASSIE.

PARSONS
Where is she?

CASSIE
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.

PARSONS
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop 
maintenance pit.

CASSIE's all-business, immediately calling-up the base floor-plan files 
on a monitor.

PARSONS (CONT'D)  (into headset)
Is Thomas gonna make it?

GUTTIEREZ   (O.S., on speakers)
Uh...difficult to say.  I think...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

GUTTIEREZ looks on as MATT ties-off a bandage.

GUTTIEREZ (CONT'D)
...The chainsaw band might have punctured his lungs.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE looks up, worriedly.

CASSIE
I found it...

PARSONS
And?

CASSIE
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.

PARSONS
Get her on-line.  Now!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CENTER

HIROKO's pulls her third bolt free.  It drifts slowly downward, 
slipping between the vanes of the floor turbine.

A fragmented VOICE comes through on her headset, distorted beyond 
recognition.  HIROKO's forehead knits together in concentration and 
annoyance.

HIROKO
What was that?  I don't copy.

CLICK.  CLICK.  BEEP!  The routine sound of the motion tracker changes 
suddenly.  HIROKO turns her attention from the task-in-hand to study 
the tracker's helmet readout.  THREE NEBULOUS BLOBS have appeared from 
off-screen.  Heading straight for her position.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE turns to PARSONS in frustration.

CASSIE
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.

PARSONS
Keep trying!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - SUMP CHAMBER

BEEP.  BEEP.  BEEP.  The signals pick-up speed the closer they get.  
CASSIE's garbled VOICE isn't helping ease HIROKO's panic.  She looks 
wildly around the chamber.  The only way out the way she came in...

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate 
access to...

HIROKO stabs the exterior helmet control.  The COMPUTER VOICE ceases, 
while the BEEPING from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume.  
Whatever the signals are, they're almost on top of her...

HIROKO turns to the narrow entry duct.  It's position makes it 
virtually impossible to get back into.  She tries anyhow.

BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP!  A rush of displaced water flood into the chamber, 
flattening her against the wall.  DARK SHAPES THUNDER past the other 
side of the grille like express trains in the night...going away from 
HIROKO.  She twitches in fear and disbelief as the BLOBS on the monitor 
screen recede and finally disappear.  The tracker's pitch returns to 
it's hollow CLICKING.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

BROKEN TUSK tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through 
the aftermath of the battle down by the now-empty rhino pen.  He finds 
something. A PREDATOR face-mask, with a massive crack down one side.  
He turns it carefully over in his hands.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

HIROKO emerges from the water, a thin membrane of surface slime 
adhering to her helmet.  Blinded, she raises a gloved hand and wipes 
the mucus away...

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
She's inside the Central Reservoir, a long cylindrical concrete tunnel 
some eighteen feet in diameter.  The water-level comes up about half-
way.  What fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion...

She's found the main offshoot of the ALIENS' nest.  Glued into the 
curved walls by a secretive resin as BODIES.  HUMANS, RHINOS, LEMURS.  
Other ANIMALS.  Most are dead, their innards blown open.  The rest are 
comatose, twitching occasionally.  Every square inch not containing 
bodies is filled with ALIEN EGGS.  It's like Hell for real.

HIROKO reaches slowly up and reactivates her helmet readout. 

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
...Brrzzt.  Traversing Central Reservoir en route to platform venturi 
dust DS two-six.

HIROKO's P.O.V.
She looks around and finds the exit point on the display. It's several 
feet away.  Under the surface.  She wades swiftly through the water, 
passing beneath something that gives her cause to pause.  A large 
PULSATING BAG, about ten feet long and roughly ovular in shape.  It 
might be translucent, but in this light it's hard to tell.

HIROKO submerges.  Sure enough, there's the grille.  She raises the 
power-tool and starts extracting the bolts.  BZZZZ!  There's the first 
one, no problem.  BZZZZ...BZZZZ!  The second and third are just as 
easy.  She goes for the fourth.  BZZZ...CHUNK.  Nothing happens.

HIROKO
Come on...

She bears down on the trigger again.  The motor's not running.  A tiny 
green LED flashes on the machine's side.  It's locked solid.  A 
malfunction.

COMPUTER VOICE  (O.S., on speakers)
Attention.  Removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate 
access to  venturi ducts.

There's only one recourse left to her.  She jams down the thumb 
button...

KER-SLAM!  The force of the rivet-gun propels her backwards, her 
internal suit-pressure making her rise to the surface.  She wipes the 
slime from her helmet yet again...

...And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG, it's top cracking open in 
four neat sections.  The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate... 

...And misses, it's fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery 
dome. HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates 
itself on the water's surface, it's powerful tail propelling itself 
back toward her.  It contracts on itself, preparing to leap.  HIROKO 
raises the power-tool,
reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again.  Fat rivets RIP 
through the FACEHUGGER's body.  It writhes around on the water's 
surface, a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it.  HIROKO dives 
into the water again. She rams the power-tool at the final bolt.

BZZZZ!  It's out!  She levers-off the grille.  Forces herself into the 
confined space beyond...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - VENTURI DUCT

Another poorly-lit shaft filled with murky water, though this one goes 
upwards on a diagonal slope.  HIROKO braces herself against the walls 
and begins to climb.

COMPUTER VOICE   (O.S., on speaker)
Traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface.

WHAM!  An ALIEN's head squeezes through the opening behind her.  It's 
claw snakes in, groping blindly just inches from her feet.  She grits 
her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent.
 
WALLPO!  It's hand closes around her leg, yanking her back.  She tries 
frantically to gain purchase on anything.  She fails.  The ALIEN draws 
her nearer, it's other hand closing on the helmet's visor.  Fracture 
lines appear on the glass, followed by cracks.  Polluted water starts 
to flood in, while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass.

HIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger.  
Rivets penetrate the creature's endoskeleton, making it draw back.  A 
haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct.  HIROKO pushes upward, 
coughing.  She closes her fist around a lever above.  Pulls on it with 
all her might.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

Internal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork.  
It hits the platform with a loud CLUNK.  HIROKO hauls herself from the 
shaft, trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit.  She 
throws the helmet to the ground, SHATTERING the visor.  Yanks 
desperately at the suit's release clamps, kicking the ruined garment 
off.

As promised, the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby.  HIROKO starts 
towards it, then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the 
ruined pressure-suit.  She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through 
the smoking pile of cloth.  Finds the flap, RIPS it open, and withdraws 
the keys.

SLAP!  A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole.  HIROKO 
scrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out.  She tears 
across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition.  The turbines 
ROAR to life, and it lifts smoothly into the air.  HIROKO pivots the 
powerful machine around, avoiding the creature's questing grasp.  
Losing it's balance, the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck.

HIROKO's guns the bike away, speeding along the platform.  The fire 
over by the auto-shop rages out of control, a column of black-and-
orange smoke rising into the air.
 
A DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support.  Yet 
another ALIEN.  It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the 
hoverbike, gaining balance in an instant.
 
HIROKO twists on her controls, trying to dislodge the creature by see-
sawing the bike side-to-side.  The ALIEN's got a firm hold though, 
crawling hand-over-hand towards her.  HIROKO releases her grip on both 
throttles simultaneously.  Air-brakes cut in, and the bike SLAMS to a 
halt.  The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the 
surrounding roll-bar. The ALIEN is even less fortunate; momentum hurls 
it back onto the concrete. HIROKO guns the engine again, and the 
leading-edge of the manta-shaped machine's aerofoil catches the rising 
creature, neatly decapitating it. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT

The hoverbike GROWLS to a halt by the base of the crane.  HIROKO 
dismounts and draws her pistol.  Takes in the sheer height of the 
ladder she's going to have to scale.  Thumbs her headset. 

HIROKO
Okay, I make it to the crane.  You...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Everybody in admin registers astonishment as her voice comes over the 
speakers.

HIROKO (CONT'D)  (O.S., on speakers)
...Can all uncross your fingers.

A WHOOP goes up.  Various hands are SLAPPED.

PARSONS
We copy, boss.  Nice going.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE LADDER - NIGHT

HIROKO's climbing the ladder.  She stops to catch her breath.

HIROKO
Yeah, well don't get too carried away; we're only halfway home.  
Talk...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)
...To you shortly.  Noguchi out.

PARSONS clicks his fingers to DRISCOLL.

PARSONS
Driscoll; you're up.

DRISCOLL's moving even as PARSONS speaks.

DRISCOLL
I hear you...

EXT.  RHUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

HIROKO reaches the top and sprints along the catwalk towards the 
Control Cab. She narrowly misses something metallic near the base of 
the handrail.  If she'd taken the time to stop and look, she would have 
seen BROKEN TUSK's ruined wrist computer.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL

DRISCOLL flips open an access flap on one wall of the ladder-well.  
Printed on the inside is a set of instructions, with the following 
printed boldly in red;

CAUTION!  EXPLOSIVE BOLTS - READ CAREFULLY!

He traces his finger along a line of text.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

HIROKO enters the cab at a run.  She flips a row of switches, and the 
control board comes to life.

HIROKO
Access panel... access panel...

She finds it.  Gets her fingers in the groove and slides it out.  
Beneath is a mini-disk drive with two buttons.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Bingo.

She pulls the vinyl-wrapped packet from her catsuit pocket.  Carefully 
withdraws the disk and slides it home.  Thumbs the first button, which 
glows an emerald green.

The board's flatscreen monitor lights up immediately.  HIROKO studies 
it for a moment, then presses her headset link.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Okay, we're in business.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP - CRAWLER CAB

Everybody from Auto-shop is crammed into the two articulated vehicles. 
GUTTIEREZ sits in the driver's seat of the first crawler.  He glances 
out of the side window.  MATT gives him a 'thumbs-up' from the cab of 
the second crawler.

GUTTIEREZ   (into headset)
Say the word, and you won't see our asses for dust.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

HIROKO wipes a trickle of sweat from her forehead.  She poises her 
finger over the second drive-button.

HIROKO
Alright.  Here we go...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Everybody in admin looks tense.

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers)

GUTTIEREZ leans forward.

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (O.S., on headset)

HIROKO blinks as the sweat drains into her eyes.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
One...mark!

She stabs the drive switch.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE - NIGHT

Smoothly maintained engineering comes to life.  The enormous yellow 
crane starts to move on it's track-rails.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

The control board monitor is suddenly awash with information and 
schematics...

HIROKO
Okay, I'm out of here!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL

DRISCOLL raises a black device shaped like a cylinder with a handgrip 
on the end.  Slots it into the mechanism beneath the flap and carefully 
turns it.  A tiny red LED comes on.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER MODULE

Complex mechanical assemblies attach the module to it's supporting 
pier-platforms.  There are a number of LOUD BANGS, similar to car 
engines misfiring.  Explosive bolts release the tethers.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LADDER WELL

DRISCOLL reports into his headset.

DRISCOLL
Bolts blown!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

HIROKO runs back across the catwalk.  She might have missed the 
PREDATOR's damaged computer before, but she doesn't this time.  Her 
foot comes down on it and she slips.  The gun goes flying from her 
hand.  HIROKO watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalk's edge for 
a moment...

HIROKO
No!

...Then goes over.  She drops to all fours and peers over the side.  
Luckily it's only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge.  She 
reaches out for it...

INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB

GUTTIEREZ pushes forward on the crawler's controls.  The head-up 
display projected on the cab windscreen changes from 'NEUTRAL' to 
'DRIVE'.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

The two crawlers TEAR OUT of the auto-shop's opening doors, headlights 
blazing.

INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ braces himself as they speed on a collision course towards 
the ditched crawler they left outside auto-shop earlier.

GUTTIEREZ
Shit!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

KER-SMASM!  GUTTIEREZ' crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway 
and through the platform safety barrier.  It balances precariously for 
a second, until finally it's weight sends it plunging into the swamp in 
a CACOPHONY of STRESSED METAL and CRUMBLING CONCRETE.

INT.  SECOND CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT

MATT
Yee-haa!  Demolition derby, baby!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

Holding the cracked mask to his face, BROKEN TUSK looks up at the 
gigantic crane moving against the night sky.

PREDATOR VISION.  
Although the helmet's nightsight is malfunctioning, it's still good 
enough to register the 'hot' infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk.

The sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets BROKEN 
TUSK's attention.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - NIGHT

HIROKO gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs, anchoring 
herself. Stretches for the pistol with renewed determination.  She 
brushes the barrel. Not good enough.  Tries again.  Success!  Her 
fingers curl around the weapon, and she tugs it upwards.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The two crawlers plunge into the curtain of flames spreading across the 
platform.

INT.  FIRST CRAWLER CAB - NIGHT

DE VRIES YELLS at GUTTIEREZ over the ROAR of the flames.

DE VRIES
Hotter 'n hell out there!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE BASE - NIGHT

HIROKO leaps the last few rungs from the moving crane onto the 
platform.  She dashes towards the hoverbike, some thirty feet away.  
With no time to loose, she slides her boots into the foot-supports, 
which automatically WHIRR closed.  Gropes for the ignition key...

Before she's even located it, the hoverbike moves.  SCRAPING across the 
concrete.  ALIEN claws appear around the edge of one of the bike's 
manta wings.  She's parked the bike over a drainage exit!

HIROKO SPINS the key and guns the engine.  The white-hot downblast from 
the turbine exhaust SPLASHES across the SCREECHING ALIENS.  The vehicle 
tilts and KICKS forward.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The two crawlers emerge from the conflagration, scorched and trailing 
fire. In the BACKGROUND, the crane-hoist centers over the admin module.

CATWALK P.O.V., 
looking straight down.  Four lasers scan quickly around the module's 
edges.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CAB - NIGHT

A blinking message on the crane's monitor screen:
POSITIVE MATCH.  COMMENCE LIFTING OPERATION.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

The sound of SHREDDING METAL makes HIROKO look down.  An ALIEN is 
hanging on the underside of the bike!  She twists the throttle, 
reducing acceleration and causing the vehicle to drop several inches.  
Sparks shower the ground from where the creature makes contact with the 
roadway.  The ALIEN's determination is astounding.  It's tail SLAMS up 
through the alloy 'wing', anchoring it.

The biomechanoid starts to pulls itself up, shifting the bike's center 
of gravity.  She fights the controls, but finds herself swerving.  One-
handed, she takes aim.  BLAM!  BLAM!  She misses the ALIEN, rupturing a 
fuel pipe instead.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The crane's clamping mechanism closes around the admin module, locking 
into place.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CLANG!  Everybody reacts as the SOUND penetrates through the walls and 
ECHOES around admin.

PARSONS
Okay, people.  Hold on tight...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The crane hoists the module aloft, free of it's umbilicals.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Pencils, disposable cups, and anything else not bolted down all roll 
from table-tops.  Most are grabbed by their owners.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

HIROKO's bike veers blindly around the corner of a building, with 
HIROKO still SHOOTING.  She looks up and her eyes widen.  Ahead is the 
out-of-control blaze.  A tongue of flame licks out across the platform, 
directly in her path.

HIROKO slides the gun quickly into her shoulder-holster and ducks for 
cover behind the bike's windshield.  The ALIEN's head twists around, 
and they plunge into the inferno...

WHOOMPH!  The liquid from the breached pipe ignites, trailing a plume 
of yellow flame.  HIROKO jams down on the foot-release and wrenches the 
steering bar hard to the right.  She leaps for safety as the burning 
bike with it's ALIEN passenger crashes through the station's safety-
rail and plummets into the swamp.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM RAMP - NIGHT

The two crawlers THUNDER down the ramp.  GUTTIEREZ' vehicle pulls into 
a tight right turn, while MATT's continues on it's course.  The crane 
with it's underslug module continues to RUMBLE slowly forward. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - NIGHT

HIROKO mechanically tries to get up from the concrete roadway.  Winces. 
Something hurts.  She looks down at the back of her left hand.  The 
skin has been scraped away. 

A DISTANT NOISE, something else being broken.  HIROKO turns.  Through 
the conflagration, ALIENS are advancing.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ' smoldering crawler pulls-up alongside Big Bertha's titanic 
wheels.

INT. FIRST CRAWLER - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ turns his head to one of the guys in the rear. 

GUTTIEREZ
Take the wheel, Roy!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES exit the crawler in a big hurry.  The moment 
they're clear, the vehicle starts up and is gone.  DE VRIES is alert, 
the tip of her rifle probing their surroundings.

DE VRIES
C'mon, man!  Let's shag it!

GUTTIEREZ begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the Bertha's 
cab.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

HIROKO's running along the platform, pistol clenched firmly in hand.  
She thumbs her headset.

HIROKO
Rob, it's Hiroko.  Come in.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE answers, holding on to the edge of her console.

CASSIE

HIROKO's VOICE interrupts.

HIROKO   (O.S., on speakers)
I've lost the bike and I'm cut-off.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

HIROKO spins around the corner, pointing her gun cop-stance.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't 
wait for me.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

CASSIE

EXT. RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

The heli-jet pad's just up ahead.  The relief on HIROKO's face is 
enormous.

HIROKO
No 'buts'.  Just do it.  Noguchi out.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ and DE VRIES pile inside the surprisingly cramped driver's 
cab. There's a seat up-front, with another behind a small control 
fascia pointing out-back.  DE VRIES hands over her rifle and slides 
into the rear.  She flicks on an overhead light.  Taped to one side is 
a black-and-white magazine cut-out of a naked male body-builder.
 
DE VRIES
Nice buns...

She gives the control board a cursory once-over.  GUTTIEREZ calls back 
from his vantage point at the doorway.

GUTTIEREZ
Can you handle it?

DE VRIES powers-up the console.

DE VRIES
Piece of cake.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - NIGHT

HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet.  The flicker of an 
andrenalin-fueled smile plays on her face...the disappears.

Like a scorpion scuttling over a rock, the ALIEN climbs up on top of 
the grounded machine.  It's head turn towards her.  HIROKO starts to 
raise her pistol... then stops.  Other ALIENS are descending the nearby 
navigation tower... straight for her.

HIROKO turns tail.  She races over to a ladder running up the side of a 
building and begins to climb.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

The shadow of the crane and it's cargo falls over Big Bertha's rear 
flatbed. Flashing warning strobes illuminate the twin hydraulic arms 
which rise up to meet it.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

DE VRIES twists on the 'waldo' controls operating the manipulator 
hands. 

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT

ALIENS rise up out of the swamp below, and start to scale Bertha's 
balloon tires.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

GUTTIEREZ fires a barrage down at the oncoming creatures.  He HOLLERS 
back to DE VRIES.

GUTTIEREZ
Move it baby, or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones!

DE VRIES
Couple more seconds!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO takes flight across the rooftops with the ALIENS in pursuit like 
a pack of dogs.  She vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with 
ease. So do the ALIENS.

She cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the 
main street, trying not to lose her footing.  Just before reaching the 
other side, HIROKO slips and falls to her knees.  Her headset drops 
thirty feet onto the concrete roadway.  Her hand rests on something 
red.  It's the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to 
the building.  She scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch.  
Glances up.  The ALIENS are already starting across.  She pulls the 
primer cylinder out by it's handle.  Jams it into the detonator, and 
turns...

She's practically on top of the bolts.  The EXPLOSION is DEAFENING.  
With the clamp on this side free, the conduit falls into the street 
with a SCREECH of twisted metal.  One of the ALIENS is pulverized by 
the falling debris, but the others survive.  All HIROKO's managed to do 
is buy herself some breathing space...

She races across the building's roof.  Reaches the other 
side...straight into a dead end.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

The admin module locks onto Bertha's manipulator arms with a satisfying 
CLUNK.  Autocouplers slot into place, and the crane releases it's load.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The connecting jolt is even greater then before.  Several larger 
objects CRASH to the deck.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

DE VRIES
That's it!  We've got it!  Get us out of here.

GUTTIEREZ looses one last volley at the ALIENS.  He pulls the cab door 
shut, and throws himself into the driver's seat.

GUTTIEREZ
C'mon sweetheart.  Do your stuff...

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT

Bertha's wheels GRIND to life, spilling ALIENS and crushing them under 
it's treads...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO's P.O.V.  It's a straight drop thirty feet onto concrete, with 
no ladders or any other way down.  She looks desperately around for 
another avenue of escape.

The leering face of an ALIEN comes up over the roof's edge.  HIROKO 
swings her pistol over and fires.  It falls away...only to be replaced 
seconds later by two others.

Her gun goes dry.  Quick as a flash, she ejects the spent magazine.  
She slaps the spare in and continues firing.

INT.  BIG BERTHA - NIGHT

Big Bertha's heading away from the base into the surrounding trees. 
GUTTIEREZ grits his teeth as they plunge towards the high branches. 

GUTTIEREZ
Get down!

DE VRIES hits the floor.  The thick boughs impact with the cab, 
SHATTERING the safety glass.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  CLICK.  HIROKO's gun's empty.  She reaches 
for another clip on her bandolier...then realises that was her last 
one.

The encircling ALIENS HISS triumphantly and close in.  With no place to 
go, and no means of defending herself, HIROKO's a goner.  The lead 
ALIEN's lethal double-barrel teeth open.  It's almost on her.  HIROKO 
CRIES OUT...

WHOOSH!  The ALIEN's face is severed in half.  A circular metal object 
blurs through the air and loops back on itself, almost faster then the 
human eye can follow.  A massive form SLAMS down in front of HIROKO, 
pushing her out of the way.  She hits the deck hard and gasps.  BROKEN 
TUSK is standing before her.  He skillfully catches the frisbee-like 
'smart weapon', then
throws it again.

HIROKO watches with awe as the PREDATOR joins battle against the 
ALIENS. HISSING ALIEN jaws are silenced by BROKEN TUSK's formidable 
fighting  technique.  Questing limbs are BLASTED and HACKED away by 
advanced PREDATOR weaponry.  Acidic blood flows freely.  The skirmish 
is surprisingly brief.

BROKEN TUSK and HIROKO stare at one another.  BROKEN TUSK pulls a slung 
metal rod from his shoulder.  Two barbed tips SCHNICK outwards, forming 
a spear. The PREDATOR looks at her, and his lip curls.  It takes a 
second for HIROKO to realise he's offering it to her.  Bewildered, she 
accepts it, pulling herself up.

A bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind, getting both of 
their attentions.  BROKEN TUSK regards her.  His mandibles CLICK-CLACK 
nervously... 

HIROKO
Look.  Don't take this the wrong way, but when I imagined the cavalry 
coming to my rescue... they never looked like you.

The PREDATOR turns away, seemingly uninterested.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

Another gout of flame BELCHES out of the churning mass in the middle of 
the station.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO turns her recovered headset over in her hands. 

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Broken.  Useless!

She throws it aside.  BROKEN TUSK stands beside her, keeping guard.  
Another DETONATION goes off behind, even LOUDER.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Jesus.  I.C.C.'re gonna have to close the book on this place.

She SLAPS BROKEN TUSK on the arm.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Come on, Butch.  Let's go.

She begins to walk away.  BROKEN TUSK crosses to the safety barrier, 
peering over the side...

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hey!  I said come on!

The PREDATOR turns a deaf ear to her.  He gauges the distance below, 
then throws himself off the platform's edge.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
What...?

She races across to the rail and gazes downward.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.
The PREDATOR wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see.  
HIROKO looks around the platform.  She's suddenly very alone.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Shit!

She crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - SWAMP LEVEL - NIGHT

HIROKO SPLASHES through the swamp towards the PREDATOR.  BROKEN TUSK 
has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform 
piers, running directly out into the swamp.  Most of the drain is 
underwater, with only about eight inches protruding from the water.  
The thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted.  Broken from 
within.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
You've got to be joking.  No way am I going back in there!

No joke.  BROKEN TUSK starts submerging to get across inside.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hey!

BROKEN TUSK pauses for a moment.  He gives her a look, then disappears 
into the blackness.  HIROKO looks around.  It's no fun being the last 
person left alive here.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Goddammit!

She takes several deep breaths, then reluctantly follows...

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CULVERT

HIROKO emerges within an air pocket inside the drain.  She shivers.  
It's just as dirty and cramped as she remembers.  Several of the 
maintenance lights down here are broken, and visibility is minimal. 

HIROKO (CONT'D)   (quietly)
Wha...?

BROKEN TUSK whirls, and clamps a hand across her mouth.  She gets the 
message.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

They exit the culvert through another smashed grate.  HIROKO finds 
herself back in the Central Reservoir again.  She wades through the 
water behind BROKEN TUSK, holding the spear above her head.  The two of 
them look very vulnerable in here.  They pass beneath the PULSATING SAC 
HIROKO saw earlier. It looks riper now, ready to burst.  An INSIDIOUS 
PULSING NOISE - like a heartbeat - gains in volume the further they 
travel.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

They come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by 
an enormous pump.  ALIEN gunk covers everything.

HIROKO gasps.  High above it a QUEEN ALIEN, nesting on top of the vast 
mechanism.  It's EGG SAC drapes around the pump; spiraling down around 
it. She seems to be asleep.

BROKEN TUSK ignores the QUEEN.  His eyes are searching the multitude of 
forms - human and otherwise - cocooned into the walls.  He finds what 
he's looking for.  Up on one wall is another PREDATOR.  Dead.  It's 
stomach blown open.

HIROKO holds her spear tightly.  FACEHUGGERS pulse malignantly, wrapped 
around several trapped victims.  A number of empty EGGS are scattered 
here-and-there.

BROKEN TUSK looks around.  No ALIENS.  He begins climbing the organic 
fresco, watching the QUEEN ALIEN carefully for signs of awareness.  The 
bellows-like SOUND of her BREATHING is overwhelming.  He reaches the 
entrapped PREDATOR. It's left arm is encased in a solidified mass of 
secreted resin.  BROKEN TUSK raises his 'smart weapon' and activates 
it.

The SPLINTERING NOISE makes HIROKO wince.  She glances up at the QUEEN.  
It's breathing start to change, and it's head moves...

BROKEN TUSK sees it too.  He hesitates for a moment.  The QUEEN 
settles, and her breathing goes back to normal.  BROKEN TUSK resumes 
his work, chipping off the final chunk of coating.  He sheathes the 
'smart weapon', and flips open the other PREDATOR's wrist device.  He 
withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier, and goes to 
work...

DOWN BELOW, HIROKO's backing away.  She doesn't see the arm coated in 
slime that grasps at her hair.  She shudders, stifling a SCREAM.  Her 
eyes are wide as she turns...

It's KAMEN.  He's been embedded into the biomechanical frieze.  When he 
speaks, his voice is wracked with pain and suffering.

KAMEN
Hiroko...

HIROKO fearfully says something beneath her breath in JAPANESE.

UP ON THE WALL, BROKEN TUSK has finished his task.  He slides the tip 
of a claw across the self-destruct mechanism.  It's readout display 
illuminates with alien characters.  He activates a button, and the 
readout begins to blink...

BELOW, KAMEN is talking to a sickened HIROKO.

KAMEN (CONT'D)
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I 
don't...remember what happened next.

HIROKO
What can I do?

KAMEN
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.

HIROKO
I... I can't!

KAMEN
You have to...

HIROKO
No!

BROKEN TUSK appears as HIROKO's shoulder.  He raises his right arm.  
SCHNICK! 
The wrist knives slice outwards.  Red blood SPATTERS HIROKO's pale 
face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

BROKEN TUSK pushes HIROKO through the reservoir.  An ALIEN EGG on a 
nearby wall PEELS OPEN.  Before the FACEHUGGER even has a chance to 
spring, BROKEN TUSK swings his wrist-blades in a wide arc, cutting 
through the EGG and it's writhing contents.

The two of them reach the deep end and have to wade.  HIROKO pushes 
herself along the biomechanical outcropping.  Ahead of them is the 
PULSING SAC. Before they're even passed beneath it, they hear 
SOMETHING.  A SOUND like water-filled balloons hitting wet concrete.
 
The SAC ruptures, spattering thick gloopy matter.  A form comprised of  
slender limbs emerges from within.  An IMMATURE QUEEN ALIEN.  Though 
just-born, it's reflexes are razor-sharp.  It lashes out at HIROKO and 
BROKEN TUSK.  HIROKO ducks, and the QUEEN's claws embed themselves in 
BROKEN TUSK's shoulder, destroying his automatic cannon.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN

A VAST EXPLOSION rips through the base, broiling clouds of flame 
rolling across the platform and seeping into the drainage ducts. 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

Columns of fire jet from fissures and openings inside the Pump Chamber, 
rippling across the adult QUEEN ALIEN and her hapless victims.  She 
begins to SCREAM, flailing around atop her metal throne... 

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - CENTRAL RESERVOIR

The adult QUEEN's SHRIEK echoes through the reservoir, accompanied by a 
ball of fire that travels part of the way down.  The IMMATURE QUEEN 
turns her head in reply, answering with her own YOWL.

BROKEN TUSK HISSES with hate, and brings his 'smart weapon' SLICING 
down through her arm, severing it at the wrist.  HIROKO simultanesouly 
DRIVES her spear into the ALIEN's chest.  She grabs the injured 
PREDATOR and pulls him away from the thrashing creature.

HIROKO
Come on!  Come on!

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

The alien numbers on the PREDATOR self-destruct readout inexorably 
count down...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN

The metal plug HIROKO blew during her earlier escape still lies to one 
side of the duct HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK crawl hastily out of.  
Fireballs are erupting all around now, making their situation 
precarious. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - CRANE CATWALK - PRE-DAWN

From a vantage point high above, we see HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK racing 
across the platform towards the heli-jet pad. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK stumbles and falls.  HIROKO bends down to help him up, but 
the PREDATOR shoves her away.  He doesn't want her assistance.

HIROKO
If you don't move your ugly butt, we're gonna end up barbecued!  Come 
on!

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN
 
HIROKO runs towards the waiting heli-jet, with the PREDATOR close 
behind. The landing pad is made up of an intricate series of grilles 
designed to deflect downward exhaust gases.  HIROKO's feet CLATTER 
across the metal...

KER-SMASH!  The metal is SMASHED from beneath, right in front of her.  
The IMMATURE ALIEN QUEEN has made is out of the sewer system and has 
got the jump on them.  HIROKO's forward momentum won't allow her to 
stop running...she's too close.  Almost at the last moment, she jumps.  
claws brush her trouser leg, but close on thin air.  She hits the deck 
and quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper.

BROKEN TUSK stops.  ALIENS are appearing all over the pad and out of 
nearby drainage ducts.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO slips into the chopper's pilot seat.  She flips a bunch of 
switches and the turbines RISE in VOLUME from a LOW WHINE to a DULL 
ROAR. 

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN

An orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind BROKEN TUSK.  With the 
ALIENS blocking his path, there's no refuge for him. Almost.  The 
Navigation Tower looms overhead, nearby.  BROKEN TUSK takes a 
calculated risk and LEAPS for it.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet flies pretty much like a standard helicopter.  HIROKO 
pulls-back on the collective, and the turbines' pitch changes from a 
THROATY GROWL to a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet rises, a little unsteadily.  The wash from the turbines 
plays across the SHRIEKING ALIENS.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  Through the canopy dome, we see BROKEN TUSK climbing 
the Navigation Tower, with the ALIENS close behind.

HIROKO
Okay, Butch.  I can play cavalry, too...

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK scales the ladder as quickly as he can.  As the top of the 
tower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array.

The IMMATURE QUEEN, accompanied by a phalanx of warrior ALIENS, is 
almost upon him.  The PREDATOR drives his wrist knives into the throat 
of a grasping ALIEN, which falls downward, writhing.  It CRASHES into 
the QUEEN, who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork.  She 
HISSES, lashing out at the creature.  Sends it hurtling to the ground.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK makes it to the top.  There's not much space on the catwalk 
to maneuver.  He looks around, then down.  This is his last stand. 
Instinctively, he reaches down to his wrist for the self-destruct 
computer. Of course, it's not there.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

The third row of digits on the alien destruct mechanism disappear.  
Time's running out...fast.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK SMASHES his foot hard into the face of an ALIEN.  A BLAST 
of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer.  He turns...

HIROKO's heli-jet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the 
tower, the door on the co-pilot's side flapping open.  She HOLLERS at 
the PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines.

HIROKO
C'mon!  Jump!

BROKEN TUSK looks down.  It's a long drop...but it's the best option 
available to him.  He jumps.

THWACK!  His hands grip the door frame.  The heli-jet wobbles slightly, 
it's center of gravity shifting.  BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and 
through the door as...

...KER-BLAM!  A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the 
storage tanks below ignite.  The shock wave buffets the chopper against 
the tower.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK's P.O.V.
The grinning face of the young QUEEN gets suddenly closer as the heli-
jet is propelled towards the metal structure.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN

CRUNCH!  The chopper hits, knocking several ALIENS from their 
handholds.  One of the QUEEN's arms SHOOTS OUT, wrapping itself around 
the port engine mount.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO pushes on the stick.  The heli-jet pulls away...then tilts 
violently to one side, engines desperately trying to compensate.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

The QUEEN is hanging from the beleaguered craft, it's weight drawing it 
slowly down.  In the BACKGROUND, the Navigation Tower begins to slowly 
collapse.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO wrestles the overtaxed controls.

HIROKO
Shit!

BROKEN TUSK turns towards her.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
In the back!  In the back!

The PREDATOR may not understand her words, but he can follow the 
frantic jerking of her hand.  He twists around to look in the chopper's 
rear.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO pilots the heli-jet over the station's storage tanks.  The 
conflagration below has gotten completely out-of-hand.

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The QUEEN is starting to struggle up, it's arms flailing for purchase.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK pulls out a pulse-rifle from the rear.  He quickly takes 
stock of it.

HIROKO
Watch your shots!  If you hit the engine you'll blow us both to hell!

BROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger.  His index finger won't slide into 
the trigger guard...it's too big!  He takes the guard in both hands and 
exerts pressure.  SNAP.  Problem solved.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

BLEEP!  There's only one set of digits left on the destruct device's 
display counter.

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

A red dot of light runs across the QUEEN's head.  She must sense it 
somehow. Her head comes round to bear...

BROKEN TUSK's got the pulse-rifle trained right on her.

BROKEN TUSK
Chew...on...this...!

BLAM!  A round open a nice, neat hole in the QUEEN's head.  She YOWLS.  
BLAM! A second round does the job.  The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and 
falls, SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below.

INT.  RYUSHI STATION - SEWER SYSTEM - PUMP CHAMBER

The last segment of the destruct mechanism's display disappears.  We 
hear a

HIGH-PITCHED TONE.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO throws the joystick forward.

EXT.  RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet accelerates hell-for-leather away.  An incandescent BALL 
OF ENERGY expands outward, vaporising the station and most of the 
surrounding bayou for about a mile's radius.

EXT.  LINSON'S RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - PRE-DAWN

Big Bertha's parked by the blinking blue beacon tower, site of the ill-
fated hunting expedition.  About a dozen or so people are milling 
around, smoking cigarettes or talking.

MATT and DE VRIES are leaning against the wheels of MATT's crawler.  
They feel the concussive shock-wave, and look upward.

Their P.O.V. 
Above the treetops, a blinding white-light BLURS OUT the horizon...

MATT
Holy shit!

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

Gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the 
turbulence out.

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

A chunk of metal is propelled through the air and RIPS into the 
chopper's starboard engine.  There's a BURST of flame, then the 
extinguishers cut in.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet's bucking like a bronco now, and they're losing height 
rapidly.

HIROKO
We've lost the starboard engine!  We're going down!  Hold on!

EXT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The chopper clips the tree boughs, and bounces.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls.  
The glass cracks with the impact.

HIROKO'S P.O.V.  
Leaves, twigs, and branches rush past as the heli-jet breaks through 
the canopy of foliage.

EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet PLOUGHS into the swamp floor with a sickening CRUNCH, 
spraying mud all around.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The canopy implodes.  A hail of glass shards RIP through the cockpit, 
spraying across HIROKO and cutting her skin.  She SCREAMS.

EXT.  SWAMP - PRE-DAWN

The chopper comes to rest in the swamp.  The SQUAWKING of the local 
WILDLIFE O.S. gradually dies down.

INT.  CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO moves her head, and GROANS.  There's a nasty gash across her 
forehead. She turns to BROKEN TUSK.  The door frame on his side is 
buckled and twisted. Part of the metal has sheared off, it's sharp end 
impaling him through the shoulder.  The PREDATOR coughs luminous green 
blood.

HIROKO
We've gotta get you out of here.

EXT.  SWAMP - DAWN

The sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to 
the other side.  She manages to get the mangled door open.  BROKEN 
TUSK's wound looks even worse up-close.

HIROKO (CONT'D)
Hold on.  This is gonna hurt some.

HIROKO gets her arm under BROKEN TUSK's shoulder.  The PREDATOR braces 
himself, and starts to move.  The agony is excruciating; his mandibles 
open and he lets out a LEONINE ROAR.

HIROKO helps him out of the seat.  The PREDATOR gets unsteadily to his 
feet. What happens next is totally unexpected.

BROKEN TUSK's throat BURSTS, fountaining green blood.  Shocked, HIROKO 
gets out of the path of the PREDATOR's tumbling mass.  She looks up.

The ALIEN stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts it's 
sledgehammer tongue, it's head following her movements.

The PREDATOR's 'smart' weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying 
blade-down in the mire.  HIROKO scoops up, activating it and scrambling 
away.  She gets to her feet and holds the HUMMING disc before her.

The ALIEN climbs warily down from the heli-jet, and the two opponents 
face each other like sumo wrestlers.  HIROKO assumes a defensive 
stance, holding the disc ready to strike.  The ALIEN hisses, it's tail 
stinger coming around. It leaps for her, and battle is joined.  The 
ALIEN lashes out, but HIROKO counters by swinging the weapon time and 
time again.  With each thrust, surgically thin wounds open up on the 
biomechanoid's body.  One of the ALIEN's attacks sends her reeling to 
the floor, it's stinger arching towards her.  She parries, slicing the 
tail in half and struggling to her feet.

The ALIEN strikes again.  HIROKO feints, then thrusts, lopping off one 
of it's hands.  The ALIEN HOWLS with pain, blinding lashing out at her 
and sending the 'smart' weapon flying from her grip.

She's lost, and the creature knows it.  It's lips curl into a SNARL.

KER-POW!  KER-POW!  The ALIEN's head DETONATES, and it's skeletal body 
slumps forward to SPLASH into the swamp...revealing BROKEN TUSK 
pointing the pulse
rifle.

The dying PREDATOR GURGLES, his head drooping.  HIROKO stumbles across 
to him.  BROKEN TUSK's in a bad way, green gore is pulsing freely from 
it's throat.  It gazes up at HIROKO.

BROKEN TUSK
Not...a pretty...sight...

And with that, the PREDATOR dies.

HIROKO look around.  The sun is rising above the treetops, and the 
setting is serene.  Somehow beautiful.

The speakers in the heli-jet cabin CRACKLE to life, jarring her.

VOICE   (O.S., on speakers)
Rimward Tracking Station, this is the one thirty-second Rim Corp 
Battalion operating out of the cruiser Tartarus from Fort Powell.  
Please respond.  Over.

There's a sound O.S., like a THUNDERCLAP.  HIROKO surveys the horizon.

HIROKO's P.O.V.  
A pair of MARINE DROPSHIPS float above the distant rainforest, their 
weapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects. Searchlights probe the 
ground far below.

A shadow falls over HIROKO, blocking out the sun.  A monstrous SHAPE 
occupies the air above, delineated only by a telltale vibration.  The 
PREDATOR shuttlecraft lowers it's cloaking device, extending landing 
gear and a ramp. It touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper.

HIROKO watches the PREDATORS file slowly out.  BROKEN TUSK's body is 
borne aloft and carried back inside.  The LEAD PREDATOR turns to 
HIROKO.  He crosses to her.  HIROKO's face is reflected in the faceted 
eyepieces of the PREDATOR's helmet.

The extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear.  KER-CHUNK!  
The tips lock into place.  The PREDATOR offers it to HIROKO.  She 
accepts, a little confused.

There's a long moment.  The PREDATOR is still standing there.  Waiting. 
HIROKO's eyes narrow.  Her mind is working furiously.  What do they 
want?

She realises.  It suddenly becomes clear.  She smiles.

HIROKO
Yeah.  Why not.

HIROKO glances back at the hovering DROPSHIPS, then walks around the 
waiting PREDATOR and into the shuttlecraft without looking back.

The PREDATOR follows her.  The ramp SLAMS closed, as we...

CUT TO BLACK
THE END
Alien Resurrection 



EXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.

We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes 
into view:

the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically 
just beyond Pluto's orbit.

We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and 

INT.  AURIGA

along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two 
guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful 
shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.

INT.  MEDLAB

Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, 
lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. 

As we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, 
then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a 
Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.

Still TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass 
encased in a clear, aspic-like gel. 

Tubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine.

As we still CIRCLE, the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can 
see what might even be a face.

Eyes, shut tight.  Sleeping. Dreaming.

ANGLE: WHEAT.

A birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen.  
Sharp contrast to what we have seen before.

There is a woman wandering through the field.  Beside her a girl, seven 
or eight, in dingey sundress.  Both have black, tousled hair.

GIRL'S VOICE

My mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there 
are.

The girl stops, looks around her.  The wheat comes all the up to her 
chest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see.

She looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty 
yards away.

The girl's expression becomes perplexed.

She slaps a bug on the back of her neck.  Pulls it off and is HUGE, 
wriggling fleshily in  her hand.  Her expression becomes even more 
distraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout.

The sound of insects-fills the air.  Another bug lands on her, another.  
She looks down in  growing horror and sees:

Blood.  At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, 
a sea of blood now, dark, thick.

The girl tries again to scream, raises her arms.  She is completely 
covered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she 
finally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth.

CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Instruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure.

Scientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic.

We can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the 
size of a man, and in a new case.

The camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a 
second one. Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLLWAY

Tiny. dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning 
into another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving 
until we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of 
dark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us...

ANGLE: RIPLEY  Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream 
it keeps shifting.

She opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless.

She reaches for her chest and begins scratching . Hard.

Tearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides.

CUT TO:

INT.  OPERATING CHAMBER

And the cause of this dream becomes apparant:

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST

being cut open with a lasersaw.

We see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it.  
And her skin is unnaturally blue. But as we PAN from her chest to her 
face her identity is unmistakable.

Around her are several men in operating masks.  Cutting her GEDIMAN, a 
young and enthusiastic scientist.  One man, seemingly in charge, stands 
a bit off, watching.  This, by tag on his coat, is DR WREN.

WREN

Careful ... ready with the amnio...

Gediman finishes cutting.  Another man steps in with a clamp. Sets it.  
Pulls apart the chest.

GEDIMAN

There she is...

He says it like he's found a lost kitten.  He reaches in an pulls out a 
sleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN. Others work at 
severing umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest.

GEDIMAN

Here we go.

He holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator 
filled with  amniotic fluid.

The alien SCREAMS, its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of 
his grasp.

WREN

Watch it!

Everybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from 
him, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio.  Someone shuts the 
top rapidly.

Everybody looks at each other for a moment.

GEDIMAN

Well ...

WREN

The host?

A surgeon looks at Ripley's readings.

SURGEON

Doing fine.

Gediman looks at Wren, hopefully.  Wren nods.

WREN

Sew her back up.

Gediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the 
alien.

GEDIMAN

Well, that went as well as could be expected--

Ripley's hand LASHES OUT, GRABS the surgeon's forearm.  He yells in 
pain as her fingers dig into him, the others scramble knocking things 
over and we HEAR HIS BONE CRACKING.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. RIPLEY'S CELL

Sudden stillness.

Ripley crouches in the middle of a small, dark chamber.  She's wide 
eyed, staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia. Hair tangled 
and wild. But at least she's not so  blue as before.

The only light on her comes from directly above, from a thick pane of 
glass in the center of the ceiling.

ANGLE: ABOVE THE CELL

A guard stands on the floor above, looking into the cell through the 
square of glass in  the floor, directly above Ripley.

(We see other panes of glass lining the floor, indicating more cells 
below.)

ANGLE: RIPLEY

She is still for a long while.  Then she lifts her hands, looking at 
them.

Touches her face, her skin.

She fingers her tunic, pulls down the neck.  There is a scar running 
along her chest.

She fingers it thoughtfully. -

She looks at her forearm.  Tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the 
number 8.

She looks up, her face unreadable.

CUT TO':

INT.  LAB

Ripley is sitting on a table as Gediman draws blood from her.

He deposits it in a test beaker, studies her eyes.

Wren enters, looking at a chart.

WREN

How's our number Eight today?

GEDIMAN:

Appears to be in good health...

WREN

(noticing his tone)

How good?

GEDIMAN

Extraordinary. As in, completely off our projected charts.

(shows him some photos) Look at the scar tissue.  See the recession?

WREN

This is from --

GEDIMAN

Yesterday!

WREN

This is good.  This is very good.

GEDIMAN

I'd like to run some tests: strength, coordination...  We're not 
looking at a normal cloning arc.

WREN:

Approved.

Wren goes up to Ripley, studies her face with satisfaction.

WREN

Well, it looks like you're going to make us all very proud.

She grabs his throat with dazzling speed, applying deadly pressure as 
she  brings his face to hers.  Her eyes are burn but lost.

RIPLEY

Why?

GEDIMAN

Oh my God...

He is as wide eyed as WREN, and he isn't having his windpipe crushed.

After a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the 
alarm.

Klaxons, red light fire up.

A guard rushes in, levels his weapon at Ripley.  After a moment of 
staring him down, she opens her hand.  Wren falls to his knees gasping.

The guard FIRES his rifle at her -- a powerful electrical charge lashes 
out and sends her flying back into the corner.

WREN

No! No! I'm all right!

The guards keep their weapons -- 'burners', these shockrifles are 
called -- leveled  at Ripley. She has recovered from the shock quickly, 
sits crumpled in the corner, looking at nothing in particular.

RIPLEY (wearily)

Why...?

CUT TO:

INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM

Wren and Gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests 
Ripley.

With them is General PEREZ, the man in charge this boat. Ramrod 
straight and about  as gruff as you would expect, he stares at Ripley 
suspiciously.

ANGLE: RIPLEY

The scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them: house, dog, 
boat.

Ripley gives answers we can't hear through the glass, looking pissed 
off and bored.

WREN

It's unprecedented.

GEDIMAN

Totally!  She's operating at a completely adult capacity.

PEREZ

And her memories?

WREN

There are gaps. And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance.

GEDIMAN

She's freaked.

Wren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance.

WREN

"It" has some connective difficulties. A kind of low level emotional 
autism.

Certain reactions....

Perez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall.

TO:

INT HALL - CONTINUOUS

The two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second 
observation room.

GEDIMAN:

But the thing is, we can't terminate her. It.

PEREZ

You haven't told me what you think has caused this.

Cloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought 
to adult term.  I'm right?

GEDIMAN

There's been cases..

PEREZ

Not like this.

WREN

Well, we don't have nearly enough data... but in some cases there is a 
collective memory passed down generationally. At a genetic level. Like 
instinct, only  more complex structurally.

PEREZ

In some cases. You're talking about the alien.

WREN

Yes.

PEREZ

You promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing.

WREN

It's not like the other ones..

Perez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second 
observation room door opens..	

He steps in, the other two right behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM TWO

Darker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards 
by the door.

Apart from-that, identical.  Perez turns to the others.

PEREZ

But there is some genetic mix.

WREN

Yes.

PEREZ

Will there be further mutation?

GEDIMAN

Mutation isn't exactly... I don't think so.

WREN

That's one of the things we need to study.

PEREZ

All right. You can keep it. But secure, under obsorvation, and for 
God's sake keep it away from here.  I don't want any more surprises.

And as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big, the 
ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at 
the back of his head.

The reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, 
stops it.

As it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the 
alien's face.

Its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off.

Perez turns to look at it with the others.

PEREZ

It took a hell of a lot to get us here.

GEDIMAN

No shit.

Wren shoots him another look.

PEREZ

How soon before this one's ovulating?

WREN

Days.

PEREZ

Is that normal?

WREN

No way of knowing for sure, but I'd say it's accelerated.

(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies.

PEREZ

They're coming.  Soon.

CUT TO:

INT. MESS HALL

Ripley sits across from Gediman. He is eating at a good pace - Ripley, 
however, has stopped.  She is staring at her fork, her brows furrowed.  
Turns it over in her hand, in her mind.

GEDIMAN

"Fork."

The memory comes, and she shakes her head wearily.

RIPLEY (softly)

Fuck....

GEDIMAN (pretending to correct her)

"Fork."

Ever so slightly, she smiles. The smile fades, and after a moment:

RIPLEY

How did you...

GEDIMAN

How did we get you?  Blood samples from Fiori 16. On ice. 

Do you remember that place?

RIPLEY

Does it grow?

GEDIMAN

Does it.....Yeah. Rapidly.

RIPLEY

It's a queen.

GEDIMAN

How did you know that?

RIPLEY

It'll breed.  You'll die.  Everyone in the ... fucking.... (searches 
for the word, then spits it out) ... Company.  Will die.

GEDIMAN

Company?

WREN (O.S.)

Weyland Yutani.

He has entered behind her, comes up to the table.

WREN

Our Ripley's former employers.  Terran Growth conglom, had some defense 
contracts  under the military. Before your time, Gediman -- they went 
under decades ago, bought out by Walmart.  Fortunes of war.

(to Ripley)

You'll find things have changed a good deal since your time.

RIPLEY

1 doubt that.

WREN

We're not flying blind here, you know.  This is United Systems 
military, not some greedy corporation. The potential benefits of this 
race go way beyond urban pacification.

New alloys, new vaccines ... there's nothing like this in any world 
we've seen.  

You should be very proud.

She laughs, bitterly.

RIPLEY

Oh, I am.

WREN

And the animal itself is wonderous. They'll be invaluable once we've 
harnessed them.

RIPLEY

It's a cancer.  You can't teach it tricks.

This stops Wren, and he retreats silently.  Ripley repeats word to 
herself, thinking.

RIPLEY

"Them" ...

CUT TO:

INT.  HALL   CONTINUOUS

As Wren is leaving the mess, he is accosted by an ensign.

ENSIGN

Doctor, General Perez is asking for you. We've been hailed.

CUT TO:

EXT.  DEEP SPACE

We see the Auriga far in the distance Suddenly A SHIP ROARS INTO FRAME, 
heading for it.  

A small vessel, it is every bit dirty and jerry-rigged as the Auriga is 
pristine.  

To accentuate the difference, the sudden roar of its engines is 
accompanied by 

HEAVY, THRASHING ROCK MUSIC.

CUT TO:

INT.  COCKPIT    CONTINUOUS

The music is coming from nearby.  Piloting the ship toward the Auriga 
is HILLARD, a roughskinned woman in her forties, along with RANE, a 
slight and quiet fellow.

Behind them stands ELGYN, the leader of the group.

Has the kind of authority that doesn't need to flaunt itself.

Maybe fifty, by the silver in his hair. He speaks into the vidcom

ELGYN

(good naturedly)

My authorization code is 'fuck you', son.  Now open the goddamn bay or 
General Perez  is gonna do a Wichita stomp on your virgin ass.

He switches off.

RANE

Wichita stomp?

ELGYN

I guarantee that boy's. Never seen the inside of a woman.

(to Hillard)

Bring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel.

HILLARD

Darlin', it's done.

ELGYN

Don't cut thrust till six hundred meters. Give em a little fright.

He puts his hand on her shoulder, runs it up along her cheek as he 
exits.

They're more than friends.

He moves through a hallway, sticks his head in a cubicle.

ELGYN

Christie!  St Just!  Rise and shine. We're docking.

He proceeds into:

INT.  CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

It's the largest space in this boat, two stories high. Taking up most 
of the space are two HARVESTERS, big rusty hovering threshers roughly 
the size of winnebagos.

As Elgyn enters, we CRANE UP to reveal ANNALEE-CALL working atop one of 
them.

She's young, tough -- at home with this  motley bunch despite her youth 
and prettiness.

ELGYN

Call!  CALL!

The music is louder here -- it's blasting from a box in the corner.  

Elgyn switches it off.

ELGYN

Call!

CALL

What?

ELGYN

We're docking! Are the cargo trucks secured?

CALL

I checked 'em an hour ago.

ELGYN

I don't want em so much as rattled. Any leakage, I take it out of your 
hide.

CALL

Trust me, boss.

ELGYN (laughs)

Not my style.

He leans down, looks under the thresher.  Lying on a gurneylike steel 
dolly, working under the machine, is VRIESS, chie mechanic.  Late 
forties, in pretty good shape considering he's got no legs.

ELGYN

How's it looking?

VRIESS  It's never gonna be pretty. but she'll fly.  The other one's a 
total fucking write-off.

ELGYN

You'll make it good.

VRIESS

Don't be so sure.

(calls out) Call!  Adjust the generator plugs!

ELGYN (straightening up)

They just gotta run, Vriess.  They don't gotta run far.

He exits.

CUT TO: INT. HALL   CONTINTJOUS

CHRISTIE is up and mostly dressed. He is black, very large, and has 
distinctly military bearing. He speaks with quiet, don't-fuck-with-me 
authority.

CHRISTIE

What's our status?

ELGYN

We're coming in.  Time to enjoy a little of the general's hospitality.

ST JUST

Oh great.  Army food..

ST JUST ("San-Jhoost") is slim, Asian -- and the epitome of cool.  

Moves quickly and silently, a sly grin playing about lips.  He is 
strapping a contraption to his forearm.  It resembles a deringer 
holder, but a very complex one.

ELGYN: We could use a rest, till the heat's off and Vriess can get 
those harvesters on their feet.

This'll keep us for a couple of days, assuming the natives are 
friendly.

CHRISTIE

We expecting any trouble?

ELGYN

From Perez? I doubt it. Still, let's be ever vigilant.

CUT TO: INT.  CARGO BAY     CONTNIUOUS

ANGLE: VRIESS working intently, the extremely nasty blades of the 
thresher inches above his head.

VRIESS

I'm patched in. Check the sequence timer.

(no answer)

Call?

ANGLE: THE CONTROLS

A hand reaches in toward the ON switch.

ANGLE: VRIESS

VRIESS

Call?

The thresher GRINDS TO LIFE -- a hundred blades and claws spinning at 
Vriess's head!

Vriess wheels out from under the machine in a second flat.

VRIESS

Goddamnit!

The second he's out he hits a lever and the back of the dolly flies up, 
transforming it-into a wheelchair.

VRIESS  Johner! You son of a whore!

JOHNER jumps down from the machine, laughing.  He's thickset, mean and 
ugly, with ugly scars crisscrossing his ugly bald head.

Thought I'd give you a little haircut there.

VRIESS

You fuck!

Call, who has been over on the other side of the thresher, ably climbs 
up on it  and switches it off.

JOHNER

You should see your face. Vriess, you must have soiled yourself.

VRIESS One of these days I'm gonna kill you. My hand to God.

JOHNER

Well, you already gave him your feet ...

CALL (jumping down)

You're a limp fucking scrotum, you know that?

JOHNER

Either of you want a piece of me, I'm less than busy.

VRIESS

Any time.

CALL

Vriess. Forget it. He's been sucking down too much homebrew.

JOHNER

Don't push me, little Annalee.  You hang with us a while, you'll learn 
I'm not the man with whom to fuck.

He exits, full of annoying bravado.

VRIESS

That inbred cocksucker.

He feels his forehead, comes up with a bit of blood.  Realizes how 
close it was ...

Call looks up at the thresher.

CALL

1 hate machines.

VRIESS

Well, now we know it works ...

CUT TO: EXT.  AURIGA DOCKING BAY

As it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship.  The bay on the 
bottom of the Auriga 

- the doors are actually OVER the ship, which rises into the airlock.

INT.  AIR LOCK

The outer doors close under the ship.  Pressurized air shoot into the 
airlock for a few seconds, and then the inner door opens. the ship 
rising into the bay.

INT.  BAY

The ship moves slowly along the huge dock to land gently at far end.  
The top of  the ship is nearly level with a grated platform that runs 
the length of the bay.

Three soldiers in full armour stand rigid on the platform. The hatch 
atop the ship slowly  opens. One by one the crew files out. Seeing them 
en masse, we get a clearer view of  what separates them from this 
Environment.  They're not wearing uniforms.  They're an  eclectic, 
fiercely indivualist group, their look varied -- spots of bright color 
showing  through militarian space gear.  Johner's bright tuorquise 
bowling shirt.  Elgy's and St Just's floorlength leather dusters.  Even 
Vriess's chair stands out as he wheels down the platform.

What they have in common is the toughness, the wary eyes, leathery 
skin.  The cool readiness to kill.  These guys are smugglers.  A long 
while ago, you'd have called them pirates

All eight of them emerge, one by one, looking around them.  They file 
past the silent, uniformed soldiers.  The last one suddenly puts a hand 
on Johner's jacket, stops him.

There is a bulge under it.  A green sensor light on the back of the 
soldier's glove turns  red when he touches the bulge.

SOLDIER

No projectile weaponry is allowed on board the vessel, sir.

Johner opens his jacket, shows what he's packing: a large thermos.

JOHNER

Moonshine. My own. Much more dangerous.

SOLDIER

Sorry, sir.

ELGYN (to Perez)

What, do you think we're going to hijack the vessel?  All eight of us?

No, I think one of your asshole crew is going to get drunk and put a 
bullet through  the hull. we are in space, Elgyn.

He enters from the antechamber, motions for the crew to follow him. 

Vriess comes abreast of the soldier.

VRIESS

Wanna check the chair?

The soldier makes no response, simply falls in behind Call, the last of 
them.

CUT TO:  INT.  ANTECHAMBER

The long neck that connects the bay to the body of the ship.  The group 
proceeds down it, the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur.

ST JUST

This place is really clean.

JOHNER (to a guard)

Hey.  You got any whores on this vessel?

(the guard remains stonefaced)

Any loose women with bad eyesight?

PEREZ

I think you'll find our accomodations somewhat spartan.  Although the 
cook sets a good-table.

JOHNER: That ain't what I'm hungry for.

VRIESS (to Call)

What's the matter?

She is looking around her, somewhat tensely.

CALL

I don't like army.

HILLARD

Yeah, join the fucking club.

CUT TO: ANGLE: MONEY

A stack of bills dropped down on a desk, then another.  They're green, 
and identifiably money. But they're square, about the size of cocktail 
napkins.  The face on them is  unfamiliar.  Thousand dollar bills.

WIDER ANGLE: INT.  PEREZIS CHAMBERS    LATER

A good sized suite, decorated in a sparse, military fashion. Perez is 
behind his desk, the money sitting between him and Elgyn.

PEREZ

This wasn't easy to come by.

ELGYN

Neither was our cargo. You're not pleading poverty, are you?

PEREZ

We're well funded. I mean the bills. There's not many that still deal 
in coin.

ELGYN

Just the ones that don't like their every transaction recorded. The 
fringe element.

I guess that would include you, though, wouldn't it?

PEREZ

Drink?

ELGYN

Constantly.  I'm guessing whatever you've got going here wasn't exactly 
approved by congress.

Perez pours two whiskeys.

PEREZ (changing the subject)

So where do you go from here?

ELGYN

Out by the Handle.  We've got a couple of harvesters, we can unload 'em 
on one of the collectives if Vriess and Call get 'em working.

PEREZ

Call.  Where'd you find her?

ELGYN

She is severely fuckable, isn't she? - And the very devil with a socket 
wrench.

I think Vriess somewhat pines.

He takes a stack of bill, smells it.  He likes the smell.-

ELGYN

She is curious about this little transaction.  You can hardly blame 
her, Awfully cloak and  dagger...

Perez hands a drink to ELGYN.

PEREZ

This is an army operation.

ELGYN

Most army research labs don't have to operate outside regulated space.

And they don't call for the kind of cargo we brought.

PEREZ

Do you want something, Elgyn?

ELGYN

Just bed and board, couple of days worth.  If we're not imposing.

PEREZ

Not at all. Keep out of the restricted areas, don't start any fights, 
and mi casa is yours too.

Elgyn drinks to that.

PEREZ

I trust, of course, that you can mind your own business.

ELGYN (smiles)

I'm famous for it.

They drink. 

CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

The 'cargo' is rolled down the corridor, armed guards flank it. It is 
wheeled into:

INT.  A CHAMBER

Where Wren and a few others are waiting.  Gediman looks a little 
nervous, not sure this is a good idea.

The cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the 
electric lock.

It springs open and the guard slides off a side panel.

They are stacked one on the other, five of them in all, cryotubes. 
People sleeping inside.

One by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second 
unit is wheeled in.

By the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in 
the dark chamber.

The scientists meanwhile retire to INT.  AN ADJOINING CHAMBER with a 
long glass window looking at the chamber.

The last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock 
behind them.

Wren starts pushing buttons.

The glass tops of the cryotubes slide open.  We see temperature and 
lifesign gauges begin to change..

There is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes 
lowers, lowers,  and rotates slowly.

Stuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs.  The ceiling rotates 
just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers.

For a moment nothing happens.

One of the sleepers eyes flutter slightly. Opens. All ten eggs open 
simultaneously.

CUT TO: INT.  CONFERENCE HALL

A huge room, used for assemblies and events. It has a chain basketball 
net set up at one end, crude court lines taped to the floor.  Ripley 
stands beneath the net with a ball, dribbling absently.

At the other end are set up tables and folding chairs.  The crew of the 
Betty, sans Elgyn, are filing in to eat here.  Johner spies Ripley, 
smiles.

JOHNER

Ooh.

Johner comes up to Ripley.  Her expression makes it clear how much she 
enjoys having him in her face.

JOHNER

How about a little one on one?

She keeps dribbling, says nothing.

JOHNER

What do you say?

RIPLEY

Get away from me.

JOHNER

Why should I?

RIPLEY

Because pain hurts.

He falters a moment at her quiet threat, then:

JOHNER Are you gonna hurt me then? 1 think I might enjoy that.

He smiles his ugly smile. She smiles back.

She hits, him solidly in the chest -- and he flies back ten feet, 
landing badly on a group of chairs.

His mates fly into action, Christie grabs a standing ashtray. Hillard 
jumps Ripley from behind.   She throws her off with e -- chucks the 
basketball at her hard enough to pop the air out of it.

Christie swings at her and SMASHES her right in the face.

She arcs back... and right back up, at Christie's throat before he has 
a chance to react, squeezing, batting away the ashtray just a trickle 
of blood coming down her nose --

Johner cames at her again and she leaps on him, throws him to the 
ground, snarling,

SHE'S GONNA RIP HIS THROAT OUT WITH HER TEETH.

WREN

Ripley.

Ripley looks up and four guards are pointing burners at her.  Wren and 
Gediman behind them.

Call, standing to one side with Vriess, reacts visibly to the name.  
Everybody is slowly backing off.  St Just stands with his hands behind 
his back, as if concealing something.

Call watches in rapt silence.

WREN

Don't let's have a scene.

Ripley lets go of Johner, stands.

RIPLEY

He... smells

WREN

I imagine he does.

JOHNER (barely breathing)

What the fuck are you?

She looks down on him - in both senses of the phrase. - Look around at 
everyone staring at her.

She wipes the bit of blood from under her nose, flicks it away. Exits.

WREN (to Gediman, amused)

Social skills, less than a hundred' percent.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S BLOOD

The few drops she flicked away sizzle on the floor -- not eating 
through, but melting  a small patch.

TO: INT.  LABS - LATER

A large metal box is being wheeled next to an observation pen. Soldiers 
surround it, weapons at the ready.  Not one of them at ease.

Wren and Gediman watch intently.

WREN

What's the status on the Queen?

GEDIMAN

We still haven't detected the origin of the reproductive anomalies. But 
the egg laying  stage appears to be over.

WREN

Did we do something wrong?

GEDIMAN

I don't know. I think we covered everything. But these redundancies...

A soldier lifts a panel in the pen and then doors to the cage come open 
automatically.

Everyone waits.

A fullgrown alien suddenly bolts into the pen. The soldier shut it as 
quickly as humanly possible.

WREN

Father, check security status, observation pen six.

Father, the voice of the ship, replies after a moment in a dulcet, 
comforting tone.

FATHER

Pen six secure, security systems functional at 100%.

WREN

Good.  Now the others.

CUT TO: INT.  SLEEP CHAMBERS - NIGHT

We see VARIOUS ANGLES of people at night:

Rane, in, a chamber on the Auriga.

Hillard and Elgyn, in a slightly more lush one.

Perez, in his quarters.

VRIESS, rolling about the Aurigals engine room, looking it over.

Christie, St Just, Call and Johner, all playing poker in the mess hall.

CUT TO:  INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM - RIGHT

A sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near 
emptiness of the room.

Gediman alone is in here, writing observations down in a notebook as he 
watches the pen.

Inside are three aliens. Two of them seem to be hibernating, curled up 
in the corner,  but the third faces the glass, tilting its head and 
hissing at it. 

Gediman sits right up close to it, his face just inches away from the 
beast's.  It draws back its lips, opens its mouth.  The metallic tongue 
issues slowly forth, dripping with slime.

GEDIMAN (softly, fascinated)

Is that a distended externus lingua ... or are you just happy to see 
me?

The creature hisses. retracts the tongue. Gediman scribbles few notes.

Something moves in the dark behind him. Before he can notice, a hand 
closes on his shoulder.

It's Ripley. She steps forward, eyes locked on the cage. Gediman seems 
only mildly surprised.

GEDIMAN

How did you get in here?

RIPLEY

Beautiful, aren't they?

GEDIMAN

Yes.  Yes they are.  I've been monitoring their interaction.

He points at a audiograph by the wall, blips and waves interrupting the 
vibrating line, indicating sound.

He notices that her hand is still on her shoulder.

GEDIMAN

They communicate.  Through ultrasonic soundwaves.  Sort of like bats.

RIPLEY

I know.

She looks at him.

RIPLEY

I can hear them.

GEDIMAN (smiling)

Amazing ...

She runs her hand through the back of his hair, gently urging him up 
off his chair.

GEDIMAN

Ripley...

RIPLEY

Shhhhh.

She pulls him close, kisses him.  Lightly at first, then deeply - 
holding his head with both hands. He responds with surprising warmth, 
the kiss drawing out, pulling slowly apart.

She looks at him, smiles.

An alien tongue SHOOTS out of her mouth, burying itself in his face.

SMASH CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CHAMBER

As she suddenly awakes, eyes wide, breathing hard.

She has been sleeping, we see, in the same position she was before: 
squatting in the middle of the room. She looks about her, recovering 
from the nightmare... Her breathing slows. With a somewhat fatalistic 
look, she settles back to sleep.

CUT TO: INTERIOR MESS HALL - NIGHT

Christie, Call, St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker 
game, stacks of bills, peanuts and liquor scattered the table.

They are in a tense hand, the pot impressively high.

JOHNER

I'm in.

CHRISTIE

All right.

ST JUST

Raise you two hundred.

JOHNER

Oh, fuck you!

CALL

That's it. I'm out. I'm fucked.

She throws down her cards, takes a swig of Johner's patented moonshine. 
It tastes horrible.

CHRISTIE

That takes me down, too. Johner?

JOHNER

Uh, Uh, fuck it. I fold.

(to St Just)

What do-you got?

St Just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck.

ST JUST

You'll always wonder.

JOHNER

You asshole.

CHRISTIE

Johner, your deal.

CALL

Deal me out. It's not my night.

She tries to stand up, takes a spill over her chair.  The others laugh.

CALL

Jesus, Johner, what do you put in that shit, battery acid?

JOHNER

Just for coloring.

ST JUST (producing a small vial)

I got something that'll take the edge off that.

CALL  Thanks, I'll walk it off.

She stumbles out of the room.  Johner shuffles the deck.

JOHNER

Bitches should not play with the boys, they will get cleaned out.

(dealing)

Eight card throwback, fuck your sister and the sevens are wild.

CUT TO: INT.  HALL

As soon as she is out of sight, Call straightens up, completely sober.  
She looks around her and takes off toward the restricted areas.

She comes to the door and making sure no one is around, star punching 
in code on the keypad.

CUT TO: INT.  CELLBLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

As Call pads silently down it, looking for one cell.

TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

The cell door opens silently.  Call hesitates a moment, then slips in, 
shutting the door behind her.

Ripley is sleeping, still in the squatting position in the middle of 
the room. 

Call approaches.

She stares down at Ripley a moment.  A shadow passes as a guard walks 
above them,

Call tenses till he is gone.  Look's back down at Ripley -- still 
sleeping.

Call extends her hand, flexes her wrist.  The meanest lookin stilletto 
you've ever seen extends from out her sleeve. it, gotta be a foot long, 
and sharp enough to shave with.

She lifts back her arm, the better to punch it through Ripley's heart.

Ripley shifts slightly.  Call stops.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST

Her shirt is open enough to show a good portion of the scar. Call 
hesitates, staring, realization flooding her face.

RIPLEY

Well?

Call starts, moving back a pace.

RIPLEY

You gonna kill me or what?

CALL

There's no point, is there?

A flick of her wrist and the stilletto whips back up her sleeve.  
Ripley sits up.

CALL

It's already out of you.  Christ... Is it here?  Is it on board?

RIPLEY (smiling)

You mean my baby?  CALL

I don't understand.  If they've got it, why are they keeping you alive?

RIPLEY

Curious.  I'm the latest thing...

CALL

Those sick fucks.

She raises her arm, the stilletto gliding out again.

CALL

I can make it stop.  The pain... this nightmare.. That's all I can 
offer you.

Ripley holds her palm up, presses it against the point of the blade.

RIPLEY

What makes you think I would let you do that?

Ripley pushes her hand out - the blade goes RIGHT THROUGH HER PALM. She 
keeps pushing her hand out slowly, a good five inches of the blade 
sticking out the back of her hand  before she stops. Call stares at 
her.

CALL

What are you?

RIPLEY

Ripley, Ellen, Lieutenant first class, number 36706.

CALL

Ellen Ripley died two hundred years ago.

Ripley pulls her hand back suddenly, grimacing at the pain.

RIPLEY

What do you know about it?

CALL

I've read Morse -- I've read all the banned histories.  She gave her 
life to protect us from the beast.  You're not her.

RIPLEY

If I'm not her. What am I?

CALL

You're a thing.  A construct.  They grew you in a fucking lab.

RIPLEY

But only God can make a tree.

CALL

And now they've brought the beast out of you.

RIPLEY (smiling)

Not all the way out.

CALL

What?

RIPLEY

It's in my head.  Behind my eyes.  I can hear it moving.  The beast.

The smile is gone, some real vulnerability showing through.  Call 
softens, trying a different tack.

CALL

Help me.  If there's anything human in you at all, help me stop them 
before  this thing gets loose.

RIPLEY

It's already loose.

Call's expression changes.  Those words terrify her, but she's not sure 
if Ripley means what she thinks.

Ripley raises her hand at Call's head -- Call flinches but Ripley stops 
a few inches away.

Then touches her forehead gently, almost sensually.

RIPLEY

Once the thought .... the hope for it ... grows here.... it has found 
its way.

It will come, because... man will bring it.  Bring it forth.

CALL

You want that.

RIPLEY

I've come to terms with the fact of it. It's inevitable.

CALL

Not so long as there's breath-in me.

Ripley LASHES OUT and GRABS CALL'S THROAT.  Call swings wit the blade 
but Ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect.  Ripley squeezes 
the girls neck.

Ripley looks at the girl with a world of sadness.

RIPLEY

I can... make it ... stop...

Call's eyes are pleading, terrified. Ripley finally lets go and she 
drops to the ground gasping for air.  RIPLEY

Go. They're coming for you.

As soon as she can move, Call scrambles up and heads out.

CUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS

Call comes out and before she can move a RIFLE BUT hits her the head.  
She goes down but  not out as two guards grab her. Wren is with them 
and three more.

WREN

I think you're gonna find that this was ill advised.

(to the men) Where are her friends?

GUARD

Mess hall, most of them.

WREN

Sound the alarm. I want them rounded up. Now!

TO: INT.  MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE: THE CARD TABLE

Being kicked over.

Elgyn, Hillard and Rane are pushed into the room, sleepy and confused.

Christie, St Just, and Johner are all being herded in by soldiers.

Call is thrown into the group as well.

ELGYN

What the fuck is going on here?

CHRISTIE

Looks like a doublecross, boss.

WREN

Where's the other one? With the chair?

JOHNER (to a soldier)

Get your fucking hands off me!

ELGYN

Do you mind telling me what the fuck you're up to?

WREN

Shut up! 

(to a guard) Get the general.  Wake him up.

ELGYN

Look, if there's a problem tell me what it is. We can work this out, 
there is no  need to get emotional ...

St Just is silent, standing in the same position he was when Ripley 
attacked Johner.

Hands behind his back.

ANGLE: BEHIND ST JUST'S BACK

As Elgyn speaks, two guns..slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands.

CALL

They got nothing to do with this, Wren.

ELGYN (to Call)

To do with what?

WREN  I don't give a fuck. It's way too late for that. You're all 
looking at a firing squad.

You hear me?

ELGYN

I do.  St Just?

With lighting precision, St Just raises his hands and blows of the 
guards away.

He takes out a third to his left without even looking that way.

One guard gets off a shot with his burner, frying Rane before Hillard's 
elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat.

Christie tackles the next as Johner presses a latch on the bottom of 
his thermos --  the top half flies off, revealing handle of a gun 
inside. He grabs it and another  guard runs. Johner doesn't have time 
to pull the gun-out of the the so he SHOOTS right through it, sending 
the guard flying..

CUT TO: INT.  ALIEN OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS

Alarms, flashing red lights.  Gediman looking in a video monitor.

GEDIMAN

What the fuck... You three!  Go! Sector two.

All but one of the guards rush out to investigate.  Gediman works the 
surveilliance screen, trying to see what's happening

CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS

When the smoke clears, There are two guards still standing.  They point 
their weapons inneffectually.  St Just a has gun to wren's head and a 
gun on the guards, who are also covered by Johner.

ELGYN

Nice and easy, boys ...

Call starts to take off.

CALL

I'm gonna finish this.

Elgyn grabs her by the hair, roughly pulls her back.

ELGYN

You're going nowhere, Annalee.

CUT TO: INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE: IN THE PEN

The three aliens have picked up the energy. are stalking back and forth 
like tigers in the dim light of their pen.

ANGLE: THEIR POV

We see Gediman and the guard, their backs to us. The aliens-stop 
pacing.  One of them,  to the right, looks at the one on the left.  
Something passes between them. They look back at the humans.  At each 
other.

They SET ON the middle alien, TEARING IT APART.  It lets out piercing, 
insectile SHRIEKS as they tear it limb from limb.

Gediman spins in terror, the guard bringing up his weapon. Gediman hits 
the lights inside the pen and as they blink to shocking brightness we 
see:

The remains of the third alien on the ground as a giant pool its blood 
EATS A HOLE IN THE FLOOR.

GEDIMAN

Oh, God

He bolts for the failsafe but it's too late as the blood eats all the 
way through  - the two aliens DIVE through the hole. just as Gediman 
hits the button -- freezing gas  fills the chamber but there's nothing 
to freeze.

GEDIMAN

No no no!

He hits another sequence and the door slides open.  He rushes in, 
kneels by the hole and looks down.

ANGLE: HIS POV

Their blood has already eaten through two levels.

GEDIMAN

Christ.  They could be anywhere.

He looks up at the guard -- and an alien FLIES UP at him through the 
hole.  

It was hanging on the ceiling below and it pulls him through before he 
can breathe a decent scream.

The guard just stares, shaking.

CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL

The mexican standoff is getting even more heated.

CHRISTIE

Who gives a shit!  We have to get out of here.

ELGYN

If Call's got something going here I want to know what it is!

WREN

You brought her here..

Two more guards rush in.  Johner shoves' his gun in Wren's mouth.

JOHNER

Drop them!  I'm not fucking with you!

CHRISTIE (indicating the dead soldiers)

Boss, we got bodies here.  It doesn't matter what Call's up to, we're 
all fucked now.

CALL

I have to stop him.  If I don't we'll all die.

WREN (pulls his mouth away)

Elgyn, tell me what you know. If she's alone in this.

HILLARD

In what?

Johner puts his gun to Call's temple now.

JOHNER

Does anyone want me to make this simple?

Far away, a SCREAM. Everyone stops.  Wren turns slowly in the direction 
it came from.

WREN

No...

CUT TO: INT.  HALLWAY BY LABS

A technican RUNS screaming just as an alien LEAPS on him from behind.  
The CAMERA  RUSHES AWAY, frenzied as the scene, to pick up a guard in 
the next hall firing wildly at the ceiling as an alien dissappears up 
an airvent.  There are three bodies lying dead before us.

ANGLE: IN THE PENS

We see that the aliens have been freed.  Smoke, dead bodies, the 
plexiglass partition to one 1 cage is cracked and open.

CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

Ripley sits in the dark, the noise of Chaos just beginning filter in.  
And she just can't help herself.

She is LAUGHING.

CUT TO: INT.  PEREZ'S QUARTERS CONTINUOUS

He is mostly dressed, still shaking off sleep.  He stands at the 
command console, bringing up visual.  Everything on the screens is 
smoke and noise.

PEREZ

Ensign! Damage Report! Ensign!

Nothing.  On one of the screens, an alien is briefly visible. Perez 
stiffens at the sight of it.

He punches up a different sector. The labs, and here is a badly wounded 
lieutenant.

PEREZ

Status!

LIEUTENANT

Containment is impossible, sir... I think they swept the barracks.

PEREZ (to himself)

A military strike.... Christ Jesus ...

After a beat, he starts punching in the emergency override codes.

CUT TO: INT.  BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

It's worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their 
sleep, and everyone awake is screaming.  One soldier runs for the 
weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and SMASHES him into 
it, falling in a tumble of guns.

Over the chaos, the emergency lighting comes on, floor light like an 
airplane's indicating the nearest exit.  Father's voice is 
excruciatingly calm:

FATHER

Emergency. Initiate evacuation procedures immediately. All hands. This 
is not a drill.

One soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong 
with two of his friends.

They're out of commission, but the alien is hurt only momentarily.  It 
bounds forward, takes out his face.

FATHER

Emergency.  Initiate evacuation procedures ...

CUT TO..

INT. HALLWAY BY ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The noise is too far above to be heard down here, but Fathers droning 
voice and the emergency lighting are on.

Vriess wheels slowly into the hall, concerned.  He spins slowly, 
checking out his surroundings.

ANGLE: DOWN THE HALL

There is nothing.. Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards 
the exit.

Vriess follows their lead, wheeling out.

CUT TO: INT.  NEXT HALL - CONTINUOUS

Nothing here either. But Vriess's fur is up -- he moves slowly, 
carefully.

And was that a noise?  He looks around, up at the ceiling.

A drop of alien blood is eating through right above him.  It drips down 
-- and he rolls out of the way just in time, back up as the blood plops 
to the floor, eating casually through.

CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY ONE - CONTINUOUS

Men are rushing into one of the lifeboats.  They sit facing each other 
in the tiny vessel  and strap themselves in.  Pere is here, hurrying 
the soldiers in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after.

PEREZ

Bay three!  Go!

The late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch.  He 
hits the eject button and steps back.

CUT TO: EXT.  THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS

As the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft.

CUT TO: INT.  BAY THREE - CONTINUOUS

Men crowd into this one too -- it's nearly full and an alien suddenly 
LEAPS into it.. starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are 
screaming.

Perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner, 
hitting the alien, the men, the controls -- a shower of sparks as the 
alien-turns, about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade. 
The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button.

TO: EXT.  AURIGA - CONTINUOUS

The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later.  EXPLODES.

CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS

The noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all 
around the group.

Father's voice still urges evacuaticion

WREN

NO!

(to Call)

What have you done?

CALL

Nothing.  Not a goddanm thing. You thought you could control it.

ELGYN

All right. We make for the Betty. Can he walk?

He is pointing at Rane, who nods, standing.

HILLARD  Betty's all the way across the ship! Who knows what's in 
between?

CALL (indicating Wren)

He does.

One of the soldiers steps forward.  DiStephano.

DISTEPHANO (to Wren)

Sir, we have to go.

(to Elgyn) Let him go.  No quarrel.

ELGYN

You can have him when we're off. Not before.

They start out, dragging Wren along.  Guns still on Call and the 
soldiers.

What about Vriess?

JOHNER

Fuck Vriess!

CUT TO INT.  FALL - CONTINUOUS

Vries enters, looking around.  He is getting seriously wigged.

The lights on the floor still pulse. Urging him forward.  He obeys.

Something stirs in the rafters.  Coiled about the pipes.

Vriess stops, still a good thirty feet from the beast.  Strains to see.

It starts MOVING, climbing at him upside down on the pipes.  FAST.

Vriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY, agonizingly slowly 
compared to the beast.

He turns the corner, spins around.

The hall is fifty feet long.  At the far end a few soldiers running 
through.

SERGEANT

Seal off that sector!

A soldier runs to obey, working the door controls.

VRIESS

No!

The soldier sees him, but the fear on the boy's face telegraphs his-
decision.

Vreiess starts pumping toward the door.  He's strong, picking up speed, 
but the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him.

Vriess can't even look back as the thing gains on him.  The door begins 
to come down, the soldier finishing the sequence and running off.

Vriess rolls, face set -- the alien a few feet behind, reaching for him

An EXPLOSION far away ROCKS THE SHIP -- the hall tilted momentarily, 
Vriess gets a  boost as he rockets downhill, the beast still on him, 
the door closing, too low for him to clear. He gets there and SLAMS a 
lever, his chair FLATTENS out to a dolly  position, his head just 
CLEARS the closing door as the alien SLAMS into it, Vriess spinning out 
and flying off the chair it tilts, landing in a heap next to him.

Lying still on the ground, he listens as the beast slams against the 
door a few more times, then fades off.

VRIESS

Fuck everything....

He reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a 
shotgun.

CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY 5 - CONTINUOUS

Perez is trying to maintain order. He is failing. Grabs a corporal.

PEREZ

Muster a squad to search for survivors!

CORPORAL

Fuck no! Fuck no! Fuck you!

Perez slams him to the ground with his fist.

An ALIEN LEAPS OUT at him from the ceiling. The soldiers scatter, Perez 
just leaping out of the way --

PEREZ

Shoot it! Fry it!

A couple of men fire their burners, to little effect.

One soldier runs up to the action. His head is bloodied, his expression 
vengefully grim.

The soldier whips out a pistol, private.issue, he takes a bead on the 
thing --

PEREZ

NO!

And the soldier FIRES -- pumps three bullets into the beast sends it 
flying back toward the window.

Perez is riveted by the sight of: ANGLE: DROPS OF BLOOD

big ones, hitting the window. Everything seems to move slowly now - the 
alien,  struggling as the soldier pumps two more bullets into it, the 
other soldiers, Perez -- the monster falls and the BLOOD EATS THROUGH 
THE WINDOW..

PEREZ

Get out!  Everyone!  Now!

Soldiers are beginning to get it.. The window CRACKS, begins to SHAKE 
as the blood is almost through it.

Even the soldier who shot the alien has stopped, his face frozen in 
horror at what he's about to accomplish.

Perez shoves him, herds the rest out, looking back --

PEREZ

Clear the sector!

at the window, the blood is almost through --

Men are pouring out of the hall -- some move down a side hall and SLAM 
the door shut  behind them, but most are making for the main exit 
anyway.

FATHER

Warning.  Potential hullbreach.  Clear sector.

The blood eats a hole in the window -- the nearest soldier is sucked 
back against the  window -- he SCREAMS as he is sucked through a hole 
no bigger than his fist.

Still men are falling over each other, Perez herding them out. 

A huge CRACKING sound, and Perez shuts his eyes.

The window explodes outward, the air blowing everything int space. 
Debris, vehicles, men, all tangled and dead as they blown out into the 
black.

ANGLE: THE SECTOR DOORS

SLAM shut instantly one cutting right through a soldier halfway out.

ANGLE: AIR VENTS

Gates slam down here as well.

ANGLE: ELECTRICAL DUCTS

Foam SHOOTS into them, hardening instantly, sealing the breached 
sector.

FATHER

Breach contained. Sector five nonfunctional.

CUT TO: INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

As the crew moves quickly through.  They come to a shut door, red 
lights along it indicating it's locked.

ELGYN (to DiStephano)

Open it.

DISTEPHMO

I can't.

Johner puts his gun to the soldier's head.

WREN

He can't!  The sector's closed.  The hull's been breached!

ELGYN

Okay, which way?

WREN

We'll have to go through the holding cells.  Here.

ELGYN

All right.

They turn left, entering

INT.  CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

that leads to the holding cells.  The room is big, a railing at one end 
looking over another chamber two flights down.

A shut door separates the chamber from the cells.

ELGYN

Can you get that one open?

It comes from the rafters, dropping down on Elgyn in a heartbeat.  He 
barely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back 
of his skull.

Hillard has time.  She SCREAMS as her lover's brains come out his 
mouth.

The beast leaps at the group, scattering them like bowling pins as it 
claws into one of the guards. Everybody else is scrambling for cover.

St Just tries to escape by running past the beast - its tail lashes 
out, tangling his feet and tripping him up, his head smashing against a 
pipe.

Another guard hits it with the burner -- it shrieks and lands on him. 
Johner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it.

Call has backed to the far wall -- she desperately works the controls 
to open the door.

It starts to rise.

CALL

Christie!  Hillard!  Come on!

The door rises fully.  Ripley stands behind it.

Call starts back, not sure what the woman will do.

Ripley surveys the scene.

The Alien, burrowing its head into the belly of the guard, stops.  
Looks up.

Everyone watches as the two creatures sense each other.  ThE alien 
hisses. rears back.

Ripley looks away, contemplative We see a gamut of emotions cross her 
face, but her posture passive, sacrificial.  She does not move.

Everyone watches, too afraid to breathe.

The alien LUNGES at her, leaping across the room in two bounds. It's on 
her -- and she SPINS, GPABBING IT, and HURLS IT AWAY.

It lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond, jumps at her, 
knocks her back into the room, on her, its claws digging into her skin, 
piston tongue at her face, inches away. 

She locks an arm around its slick, long head and pulls back we hear its 
tendons strain, snap.

CALL (to a guard)

Shoot it!  Shoot them both!

She grabs his gun and BURNS them both.  Two less-than-human SCREAMS 
fill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart.

The beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for Ripley 
again.

Ripley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with 
inhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head.

She dives at it as it comes out from under....

Call shoots as Ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as Ripley's 
momentum sends them over a railing and they FALL TWENTY FEET -- the 
Alien lands with a spine snapping crunch,

Ripley only slightly better.

A few crew members rush to look over the railing.  Christie starts down 
the spiral staircase to that level.

JOHNER

Where are you going?

The creature rolls back onto Ripley, grabbing her with its dying 
strength. Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off... 
its jaws open, dripping shaking...

The tongue SHOOTS OUT and Ripley GRABS IT. HOLDS IT.

A scream wells up in her throat.  A totally animal killshriek that she 
SCREAMS, victorious, as she RIPS THE ALIEN'S TONGUE OUT OF ITS FACE.

She stands, bellows another warrior cry. The crew has gathered near.  
They watch her, awed, wary. Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to 
Call.  Ripley looks a tad pissed.

Call tenses, maybe wishing she hadn't shot Ripley as well.

Ripley takes Call's hand, puts the tongue in it. walks on.

Call looks at the dripping souvenier.  The pincers at the end still 
twitching.

CHRISTIE

What the FUCK is going on here?

RANE

What was that thing?  Are there more of that thing?

JOHNER (to Call)

Make a hell of a necklace...

ANGLE: HILLARD

on the upper level, kneeling by Elgyn's body.  No tears, but terribly 
quiet.

What do we do?

CHRISTIE

Same thing we were doing.  We get the fuck.

RANE

What if there's more?  Let's stay here and let the army guys deal.  
Someone will come... I mean, where are the fucking army guys?

St Just is very calmly looking up at the rafters, guns drawn

CHRISTIE

Doctor.  You know what that thing is?

WREN

I do.

CHRISTIE

And there's others.  How many?

The doctor looks around, almost guiltily.

WREN

Thirty.

JOHNER

Thirty!  We are fucked in our pink bottoms if there's thirty of those 
things.

RIPLEY

There'll be more.

Everyone looks around at her.  She is squatting in the corner facing 
away from them.

RIPLEY

They'll breed.  In a few hours there'll be twice that number.

(she stands, approaches them)

So who do I have to fuck to get off this boat?

CHRISTIE

You bought your ticket when you killed that thing. welcome aboard.

CALL.

Are you fucking crazy? She doesn't care if we....

CHRISTIE (fiercely)

You got no authority here, Call!- Now secure it!

It's the first time Christie has raised his voice, and it has the 
desired effect.

After a silent moment, Call starts again softly.

CALL

Christie, she's not human.  Wren cloned her because she was carrying an 
alien in her.

She could turn --

JOHNER

Nobody cares about your opinion, you bitch, you fucking mole --

CALL

She'll turn on us!  Just like that!

CHRISTIE

I don't give a syphallitic fuck whether you people can get along or 
not. If we've got a wish to live then we work together, and that 
includes bug-lady.

CALL

You can't trust her.

CHRISTIE

I don't trust anyone.  CUT TO: INT.  CHAMBER/CELLBLOCK - A BIT LATER

The group is still in the adjoining chamber, but looking here into the 
cellblock where 

Ripley had been.  DiStephano and St Just come first, guns ready, 
looking about them.

They are followed by Christie and Wren.

WREN

There's a console in the guards, station.  We can punch up a diagnostic 
of the ship and plan a route.  To your ship.

CHRISTIE

That likes me fine.

He signals for the others to follow, everyone moving cautiously.

ANGLE: HILLARD

Gently lays her coat over Elgyn's face. Johner looks down a moment.

JOHNER

Via con Dios, man.

Hillard stands. Call puts ahand on her shoulder but Hillard moves away, 
a distrustful look on her face.

Ripley, bringing up the rear, watches the whole group with a sort of 
fascinated detatchment.

Call looks back at her.  Ripley smiles, coldly.

ANGLE: IN THE CELLBLOCK

The group makes their way slowly, quietly.  They approach a bank of 
elevators, but Wren points down an adjoining doorway.  They are about 
to go there when the elevator door lights up, indicating arrival.

The group backs up, spreads out. Those who can find cover take it. guns 
drawn.

The elevator doors open.  It is too dark inside to see:

Suddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator and a 
figure appears in the light.

Everyone jolts, about to fire. before they realize it is

VRIESS

Who sits in his chair, a shotgun in each hand, eyes wide. twitchier 
than they.

JOHNER

Oh, fuck...

CALL

vriess!

VRIESS (mock casual)

Hey, whatchyou guys doing?  Hey, Annalee.

CHRISTIE

Thought you were toast for certain.

VRIESS

You've seen that fucking thing?

WREN (suspiciously)

Where were you?

VRIESS

I was down by -- what do you mean? I was in maintenance, checking out 
your oxidation systems.

JOHNER

Doc's got a bug up his ass 'cause Call's a mole and he thinks we're a 
conspiracy.

VRIESS (looking at Call)

She's a what?

JOHNER

A mole.  A fucking spy.

Vriess looks hit harder by that information than anyone.

CHRISTIE

We got'a mission here, people.  Let's keep moving.

They do.

CUT TO: INT.  GUARDS, STATION - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE: THE CONSOLE

A hologram of the ship appears above the screen.  It looks a solid as 
the ship itself, except that parts of it occasional break themselves 
down to show interiors.

The group looks it over. Parts of the ship are simply not there, the 
sections around those holes red.  Wren points them out.

WREN

We've had hull breach by the lifeboats, here on level five, and down -- 
Jesus, right by the engine room.  We're very lucky.

ST JUST (sarcastically)

Lucky we.

CHRISTIE

What about the Betty?  Our ship.

WREN

The dock seems to be intact.

CHRISTIE

Then we head for it.

JOHNER

Can we track those fucking things?

WREN

No.

JOHNER

We could get to the Betty and they could be all over it!

RANE

Are you toting a better fucking idea?

WREN

All of the activity seems'to have been in the aft-sector, by the 
barracks.

There's no reason to suppose they'd move

RIPLEY

They won't.

Everybody looks at her.

RIPLEY

They're breeding. They've got new bodies to work on. They'll stay 
close. If they send anybody out, it'll be here. Where the... meat is.

CALL

'The meat' . Jesus.

ST JUST

They're breeding.  How long does that take?

RIPLEY

Hours.

WREN

Or less.  The process has accelerated, something to do with the cloned 
cells.

CHRISTIE

Faster we get from here to there, the better.

ST JUST

With all the devils of hell in between.

JOHNER

Well, if we want to make decent time I say we ditch the cripple.

(to Vriess)

No offense.

VRIESS (giving him the finger)

None taken.

HILLARD

Nobody's left behind, Johner. Not even you.

Her voice is quiet, mourning still thick in it.  Nobody backtalks her.

CHRISTIE

So what's our route?

WREN

I'm trying to figure it. we can cut through the labs, but we're blocked 
on both sides here,

I'm not sure

DISTEPHMO

Sir?  There is the lift.

WREN

Show me.

DiStephano works the console and the hologram splits, the route he's 
indicating revealed.

DISTEPHMO

The lifts. They run straight from the top of the ship down to 
engineering. No stops, but  if we can get in the shaft, there's a 
maintenece access tunnel here

(points to the center of the shaft)

that runs above level one deck. Take us right to the dock.

CHRISTIE

Sounds reasonable.

DISTEPHANO

I don't have the code for the access tunnel door.

WREN

I can override.

DISTEPHMO

(indicating the route)

Then we head through the labs, then down to the kitchen.  To the bottom 
of the shaft.

Up, through the tunnel, and onto the ship.  Home free.

ANGLE: VRIESS

Is unloading additional ammo from inside his chair.  He toss one of his 
shotguns to Hillard.

VRIESS

They never check the chair...

He pulls out a grenade launcher.  It's so compact it's almost cute, 
cradled one handed like an uzi.

VRIESS

Call.

She looks around and he tosses it to her.  The gesture is not 
acconmpanied by any show of warmth.

VRIESS

Try not to shoot your foot off.

WREN

You people should know --

ST JUST

We.won't shoot at the windows, Doc.

WREN

No. The aliens, they bleed molecular acid.

CHRISTIE

That's right, I saw that.

VRIESS

So did I.

JOHNER

We can't shoot them?  Fuck that, I'm shooting them.

WREN

This is a big vessel, and for the most part we should be okay. But if 
we get anywhere near the outer hull and start strafing them...

He indicates the hologram, the sections of the ship missing.  Everyone 
gets it.

CHISTIE

If we're clear then let's get on it. We'll go by twos --

RIPLEY

We're moving.

CHRISTIE

What?

RIPLEY

The ship is moving. 1 can feel it.

RANE

I don't feel shit -- what, do you mean they're piloting this fucking 
thing?

VRIESS

This ship has stealthrun, even if we were moving there's no way she 
could feel it.

CALL  She's right.

Call is working the computer now.

CALL

The ship's been going since the attack.

WREN

It's uh, it's standard, I think.

DISTEPHANO

That's right. If the ship takes on any serious damage it autopilots 
back to homebase.

CALL (to Wren, pissed)

You were planning to let us know this?

WREN

I forgot.

HILLARD

What is homebase?

WREN

Earth.

CALL

Oh, God.  Oh, you bastard...

JOHNER

Earth?  I'm not going to that fucking slum.

CALL

If those things get to Earth, It'll be...

RIPLEY (not very concerned).

The end.

ST JUST

That's not our problem.

CALL

We've got to blow the ship.

CHRISTIE

We don't have to do anything till we get off it.  How long till we get 
there?

CALL

Three hours.  Almost.

CHRISTIE

Then that's what we got.  Let's move.

CALL

Don't you understand what this means?

CHRISTIE

I understand my hide.  And I like it on me. Let's go.

(to Ripley)

What are you called, Ripley?  You mind taking point?

She moves to the head of the line, and they start.

CUT TO: INT.  LABS - LATER

As they progress.  Everyone with a gun has it at the ready.  Ripley is 
a few yards in front.

She stops, sniffs.  Listens.

RIPLEY

Clear.

Johner moves up next to her.

JOHNER

You've come up against these things before?

RIPLEY

Yes.

JOHNER

So what did you do ?

RIPLEY

I died.

He lags behind a bit, thrown.

JOHNER

That wasn't really what I wanted to hear...

DiStephano points to a door.

DISTEPFANO

This way.

And Ripley leads them in.

CUT TO: INT.  LAB - CONTINUOUS

As Ripley enters, we can see that this lab has been trashed.  Ripley 
surveys the wreckage calmly, keeps moving. As the others file in, their 
horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one.

Among the debris are three bodies, chests exploded outward.

JOHNER

Fuck me ...

CHRISTIE

Let's keep moving.

The door to the next chamber is ajar. Christie and Vriess in, then St 
Just, then Ripley.

INT..NEXT CHAMBER

Something LEAPS at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar SLAMS 
into her side, throwing her off balance.

St Just and Christie spin, weapons up, and almost shoot the figure 
cowering in the corner.

Everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him, eyes wild with 
terror.

PURVIS

Get away from me!

CHRISTIE

Drop the rod, man.  Do it!

PURVIS.

Get away...

But the energy is out of him.  The rod falls with a hollow clatter. He 
looks weakly from face to face.

PURVIS

What's going on?

St Just looks at his name, stitched in his coveralls.

ST JUST

Purvis.  What's going on is that we're getting the fuck off this ghost 
ship.

PURVIS

What ship?  Where am I? 1 was in cryo on the way to Xarem, work crew 
for the nickel refinery...

I wake up, I don't understand... I saw something... horrible ...

CALL

Look, you come with us.  It's dangerous here.

Ripley SNIFFS.  Cocks her head.

RIPLEY

Leave him.

CALL

Fuck you.  We're not leaving anyone on this boat.

RIPLEY

He's carrying..

JOHNER

He's what?

RIPLEY

He's got one....	inside him. I can smell it.

PURVIS

Inside me? What?

JOHNER

Shit, I don't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass.

VRIESS

It's a bad risk.

CALL

We can't just leave him.

VRIESS

I thought you came here to stop them from spreading.

CALL (to Wren, torn)

Isn't there a process, can't you stop it?

ST JUST

We've got no time for that.

WREN

I couldn't do it here. The lab's torn apart.

ST JUST (quietly)

I could do him. Painless, back of the head. Might be the best way.

CALL

There's gotta be another way. If we freeze him --

PURVIS

WHAT'S IN-FUCKING-SIDE ME?!?!?

They all look at him, a bit sheepishly.

WREN

A parasite.  A foreign element that ....

Ripley steps in front of the doctor.

RIPLEY

There's a monster in your stomach. They (indicating the smugglers) 
hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him (indicatingWren) and he put 
an alien in you. In a few hours it will punch  its way through your 
chest and you'll die.  Any questions?

Purvis is wide-eyed, stunned.  After a moment he stammers

PURVIS

Who are you?

RIPLEY

I'm the monster's mother.

She starts heading out of the chamber.  Call turns to the others.

CALL

He comes with us.  We can freeze him on the Betty and get the doctor to 
remove it later.

WREN

All right.

JOHNER

Since when are you in fucking charge?

CALL

Since you were born without balls.

VRIESS

Ease off, people.

CHRISTIE (to Purvis, herding him along)

Come with us.  You might even live.  Get twitchy on me and you will be 
shot.

They move out.

CUT-TO: INT.  HALL - LATER

still in the same general area, still looking around every corner.  
It's been too quiet too long, and the group senses that & They move 
into

INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM TWO - CONTINUOUS

It's in bad shape, so we might not recognize it as the chamber the 
queen was in.

WREN

She's gone.

ST JUST

Who?

WREN

The Queen.

JOHNER

Good.

He is loooking into the room.the queen was kept in.  A residue of slime 
is all that's left here.

Beyond the queen's chamber is another observation room.  Wren indicates 
that they have to go through.

Suddenly a burner blast FIRES at them, just missing them as they duck.

They hear more blasts, not aimed at them, and screams.

SOLDIER (O.S.)

Pull back!   Pull back!

OTHER SOLDIER (O.S.)

It's on me!

Ripley looks up and can just see two aliens making short work of a 
group of soldiers.

Call instantly moves to attack, and Ripley grabs her, holds tight.

CALL

We've got to help them!

RIPLEY

Can't.

CALL

You bitch, let go of me!

She does, and Call rises.

The noise is gone. What she can see of the soldiers-is parts.

She is shaking at the vision when an alien RISES in front on the 
soldiers.  Call ducks back down, terrified.

Christie hisses at her.

CHRISTIE

You want to get yourself killed, then you run solo.

ST JUST

How many?

RIPLEY

At least two.

ST JUST

Think they heard us?

RIPLEY

Yep.

HILLARD

Fine by me ...

JOHNER

Yeah, let 'em come.

CHRISTIE

Wren.  Any other way around?

Wren shakes his head.

CHRISTIE

We can't just walk in there.

WREN (thinking)

No. No, but they can.

CHRISTIE

Say again?

WREN

The cages all have failsafes.  Liquid nitrogen.  Get 'em to come to us 
and I can freeze em.

CHRISTIE

Excellent.   Get-ready.

Wren goes over to the failsafe button. The others look out at the 
aliens.

CHRISTIE

Okay... (calls out) Hey!

VRIESS

Hey, guys!

JOHNER

Here, kitty...

The aliens react, start for the cage.  Four 'of them.  They reach the 
edge of it and stop.

Look around, at each other..

But go nowhere.

DISTEPHMO

They're not coming.

JOHNER

Hey!  Fresh meat here!

RIPLEY.

They know it's a trap.

RANE

Oh, bullshit!

CHRISTIE

What do we do?

JOHNER

Shoot the fucking things!

VRIESS

There's too many, and we don't have the angle.

RIPLEY

Bait.

CALL

What?

RIPLEY

Give em a reason to go in there. Throw somebody in.

HILLARD

Fuck you!

RIPLEY

DO we want to live? Give em her.

She indicates Call, who looks around, nervous at the lack of protest 
about this idea.

Ripley points at Rane.

RIPLEY

Or the skinny one, it doesn't matter. We can't resist the smell of 
meat.

CALL

We ?

JOHNER 

Fuck, I'm with her!  Give 'em Annalee!

CHRISTIE

Now hold on

DISTEPHMO

You people are insane.

JOHNER

Now you're not exactly in the club either, soldier.

People start pointing guns at each other.

RANE

Fuck you all, I'm not dying for you.

CALL

Stop this.

Ripley grabs her.  Looks at the others.

RIPLEY

Come on!  Do you want to live or not?

(to Call) It won't hurt long.

CALL (terrified)

Noo...

RIPLEY (to Wren)

NOW!

Wren hits the button just as three aliens are bounding across the cage 
-- they're almost to the posse, people screaming, scrambling, when the 
freezing gas hits, turning the beasts to statues.

The forth one sees this and flees, but St Just stands and put four 
bullets in it from forty yards. It slumps over.

Everyone is silent, stunned.  Breathing hard.

VRIESS (realizes)

Fear.

Ripley nods.

VRIESS

That's how they knew it was a trap.  They couldn't smell the fear.

RIPLEY (looking at Call)

So I gave them some.

JOHNER (gleefully)

Son of a bitch!

He pops up and FIRES at the frozen aliens - - they EXPLODE into 
fragments.

CUT TO: EXT.  AURIGA

Gildihg through space, passing Jupiter's moons with dazzling speed.

CUT TO: INT.  HALL   LATER

Ripley and Call are on point.  Ripley looks down the hall.  Call is 
staring at her, and

Ripley can feel the girls eyes on her back.

RIPLEY(without looking around)

Did you think I was going to... feed you to them?

CALL

I think you still might.

Ripley smiles.  She may be right.

RIPLEY

I want to live.

CALL

And you don't care about anything else.

RIPLEY

No.

CALL (bitterly)

I guess you're more human than I thought.

RIPLEY

Why did you come here?

CALL

To kill you, remember? (after a beat) Because somebody has to.

RIPLEY

well it's not me.  I did my time.  Now I just want to...

She stops dead, staring at a door.

CLONING STORAGE FACILITY is written on it. Stencilled beneath that is 
`numbers 1-7`.

Ripley stares. Tries the door, which opens.

DISTEPHMO

That's not the way.

CHRISTIE

Ripley, we got no time for sightseeing.

Ripley is looking down at her arm, at the 8 tattooed on it.

She looks at Call.  Looks back at wren.

WREN

Ripley... don't.

She enters.

CUT TO: INT.  CLONING STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

She stands a moment, staring, before proceeding through it.  Call 
stands in the doorway, others crowding behind her. Every face registers 
the horror of what they are seeing, but none more so than Ripley's

Numbers one through seven.  The first failed efforts to clone Ripley.

They are lined up like museum exhibits -- or side show freaks.

Here is the fetal Ripley, the fetal alien visible through its 
translucent chest.

In a jar.

Here is a prematurely old, diseased Ripley, withered blue skin cling to 
Collapsed bones.

Here is an attempt to separate the alien and grow it without the host -
- boneless, bubbling tissue, weak and useless mouth rigored in midmew.

Each one more horrifying than the last, and the last the worst of all.

Ripley approaches, and stares at number seven.

A complete mixture of alien and human DNA.

A tortured, disgusting hybrid, half Ripley, half nightmare.

Hooked up wires and machines, it lies on the tilted-table, its head 
nearly level with

Ripley's as she finally approaches it.

When it opens its eyes, they are hers.

it tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her.  Recognises her.

Ripley cannot even speak.  She begins to shake slightly looking at 
number seven.

NUMBER SEVEN

Kill ... us ...

Ripley's eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling 
a mouth.

Ripley staggers back a step, shaking now.  This is too much to bear...

CALL

Ripley!

Ripley turns, slowly, still in a fever dream.

Call cocks the grenade launcher with a loud CRACK.  Her eyes meet 
Ripley's.

Call tosses it to Ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it 
Ripley FIRES, a grenade chugging to the end of room and BURSTING in 
fire and noise, she FIRES another, tissue and steel exploding into 
flame, she turns to number seven, hand shakes momentarily...And she 
FIRES, the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame.

Freezing gas jets fill the room, extinguishing potential spread, but 
the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber.

She backs out, the crew waiting for her outside.

The launcher falls loudly to the ground.  Ripley turns to Wren, her 
face rigid with pain.

Wren backs up a step, looking around him for protection that the others 
have no thought of providing.

CALL

Ripley... Don't do it.

Ripley stops. weariness suffusing her expression.

RIPLEY

Don't do what?

The tension pases.  Wren breathes a little sigh of relief.

Call PUNCHES him across the jaw, his head whipping around as collapses 
to the ground.

Call starts down the hall, not even looking at him.

CALL

Don't do that.

Feeling his jaw, Wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this.  
It's kind of winning.

Christie helps him up.

CHRISTIE

Had it coming, Doc.

Johner looks in at the burning lab.

JOHNER

What's the big deal?  Fucking waste of ammo.

ST JUST

Let's move before anything comes to check out the noise.

JOHNER

Chicks, man....

DISTEPHANO

We go down from here.

CHRISTIE (to Vriess)

We got to lose the chair.  Vriess.

VRIESS

I know.

CHRISTIE

Kawlang maneuver, all right?

Vriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair.

VRIESS

Just like old times...

CUT TO: INT.  ROOM - LATER

A hatch opens. Ripley drops down, surveys the scene.  Quiet dark, 
empty.

Ripley comes up, Call behind her.  Ripley sniffs, listens.  Closes her 
eyes. After a beat she starts further in and Call motions for others to 
follow.

Slowly, they make their way down the corridor. Ripley, Cal ,Hillard , 
guns drawn.

Bringing up the rear is Christie, toting a shotgun.. He turn slowly, 
alert, and we see that Vriess is strapped to his back facing the other 
way, also with a shotgun.

CALL (to Ripley)

That lab... 1 can't imagine how that must feel.

RIPLEY

No. You can't.

Ripley looks down.  The floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark 
water.

Ripley steps into it, moves up a few paces. The others gingerly follow.

Vriess is facing the back. He looks up.

VRIESS

The cooling tanks.  They must have blown during the trouble.

ANGLE: THE COOLING TANKS

We see the round underbelly of two huge tanks.  There are gaping, 
twisted holes in them.

JOHNER

The nasties couldn't have done it, could they?

HILLARD

What for...?

WREN

Down here. He is at the front with Ripley and-Call, where the water is 
waste deep.

He looks down at a stairwell, just the top of the railing visible above 
the murky water.

RIPLEY

There's no other way?

WREN

We're at the bottom of the ship.  Some of the worst damage is down 
here.

Most of the sections are sealed off.

RIPLEY

You're sure?

WREN

There's the noncom's entrance back there, but it's flooded too, and 
it's a longer run.

CALL

He's right.  We're gonna have to do it this way.

WREN

It's just through the kitchen, then up, maybe seventy feet.

RIPLEY

I don't like it.

ST JUST

What's to like?

CHRISTIE (to vriess)

You ready to get wet, partner?

VRIESS

Oh yeah.

HILLARD

You sure about the distance?

WREN

Yes.

CALL

No locked doors?

WREN

It's an open hall.  Just keep left when you hit the bottom of the 
staircase.

JOHNER

This sucks.

ANGLE: DI STEPHANO

He flips caps over the barrel of the gun, slides a panel over the 
digital readout.

The burner is ready to go, watertight.

DISTEPHMO (to St Just)

You should secure'your weapons.

St Just holds up his two guns.

ST JUST

These are disposables.  They can take it.

DISTEPHANO

Disposables. I heard about those. How many rounds?

ST JUST

Twenty. Split points, give you a good hole even at the smaller caliber.

DISTEPHANO

Cool.

ST JUST

They're big with hitters. 'Cause you throw em away after the job. 
Nobody likes throwing  away a weapon they're attached to.  You know?

He smiles at Di Stephano, who looks a little uneasy about the turn the 
conversation has taken.

He joins the others who are getting ready to dive..

CALL

Do I have to tell everyone to take a deep breath?

A couple of the guys smile.

VRIESS

Christie, do me a favor.  When we hit the surface on the other side... 
no backstroke.  Okay?

CHRISTIE (laughing)

You'll be forever blowing bubbles. On three...

He counts down, the two suck in enormous breaths -- and dive right 
behind Call and Ripley.

One by one the entire crew slips down into the black water.

CUT TO:  INT.  STAIRWELL\KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

It's all underwater.  Visiblity is poor.  The crew move swiftly and 
gracefully down the stairs and into the kitchen.

In here it's a tad labyrinthian, and the size of the room it darker. 
Wren heads straight for the other end.

They swim.  Safety is a good fifty feet away.

They are tense, concentrated.  Swimming past dark spaces.  Anything 
could be hiding here.

Johner looks about him, very nervous.  Dark spaces.  He looks behind.

Three aliens are right behind him.

Panic blows half the air out of his mouth as he swings around and FIRES 
at them, tags one as the other two swim off into shadows with horrible 
ease.

Ripley, all the way to the stairs, sees.  She hurries the others past 
her.

They swim frantically for safety, Hillard Wren, Christie and Vriess.

Rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness, 
pull him into it.

Hillard FIRES in that direction, Johner bringing up the rear still 
firing at the third one, wounding it but not scoring killshot.

Call is swimming up ther staircase, the growing light above indicating 
the surface.

She is almost to it when she is IN THE WEB.

A net of translucent alien goo, it is spread just six inche below the 
surface.

Call struggles the goo sticking to her she's running out of air -- as 
Wren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear 
through it, but they are getting weaker.

Ripley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her, aliens close 
behind.

She looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface 
-- but an  alien GRABS her foot, holding her down. Now SHE is running 
out of air KICKS at it, it  lets go.

The others are fighting, Call pops her stilletto and cuts through, but 
it's tough, she  still can't get her head up --

--Di Stephano, off to the side, is drowning.  Takes in a huge mouthful 
of water and begins thrashing.

Ripley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut, pulls it apart 
with a mighty heave, she glides up through --

CLOSE UP: RIPLEY'S FACE

Just BREAKS the surface, she takes in a huge GASP of air, FACEHUGGER 
CLAMPS DOWN ON HER.

Ripley goes back under, pulling at the thing as others break the 
surface.

Wren comes up and a hugger LEAPS right at him ,but Call nails it in 
four shots.

Christie and Vriess break surface and both begin FIRING, back to back, 
in a circular sweep.

They decimate a number of eggs

ANGLE: UNDERWATER

Ripley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off, its 
fingers singeing the sides of her face, leaving marks like warpaint.  
Worse, its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat, thrashing 
horribly.

In utmost disgust, Ripley PULLS it APART. and the three aliens are 
COMING RIGHT AT HER.

ABOVE - THE SURFACE

Most of the crew has gotten up out of the water.  Christie holding a 
facehugger inches from his face, others screaming, taking a bead on it.

CHRISTIE

Get it!  Kill it!

CALL

The blood'll burn you!  Throw it!

He does, and Johner nails it in midflight.

Hillard and Johner pull Di Stephano out of the water, but he is not 
breathing.

ANGLE: UNDER THE SURFACE

Ripley is grabbed by an alien -- and St Just comes up behind her and 
shoots it.

They swim up and away from the spreading, lethal bloodpool.

ANGLE: ABOVE THE SURFACE

They come up out of the water, and an alien rises right behind them.  
Everyone who can, shoots it.  It falls back into the water.

CHRISTIE

A trap!  They set a goddamn ambush!

JOHNER

Give me that!

He pulls the burner off Di Stephano's body, even as Call is giving him 
mouth to mouth.

Johner flips the gun open and FIRES at the water, the whole thing 
SMOKING and sizzling with the electrical charge. we hear an alien wail 
bubble from below the surface.

JOHNER (grinning feverishly)

Okay!  Everybody out of the pool!

VRIESS

Let's get the fuck!

Di Stephano sputters back to life.  Ripley picks him up with one hand,

HILLARD (to Wren)

Which way?

WREN

Up here.

He takes off, the others following.

WREN

Up through the lift shaft!

He stops at a pair of sliding doors, starts working the panel.  Ripley 
come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt.

ST JUST

Company!

He's refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens.

She herds them into the shaft.

CUT TO: INT.  LIFTSHAFT - CONTINUOUS

It goes down about four stories, and up seemingly forever.. Enough room 
for or three

elevators, one of which is two stories below.

WREN

UP!

He starts climbing.  It's not that hard -- there are ladders in each 
shaft section.

Call comes up behind him.  Ripley and others pair off on other ladders.

They climb fast, they're three stories up before the aliens begin 
POUNDING on the metal door, it buckles under their might.

JOHNER

Move!

WREN

Not far!

Still POUNDING -- one alien gets its head in, looks up, hisses, pulls 
it out.

ANGLE: LIFT

Wren comes to a cralwspace ledge.  He climbs on.  Set back a few feet 
from the shaft is a small maintenance access door. works the keypad 
beside it as Call climbs up behind him.

The aliens SMASH through the door, one of them SAILING across the shaft 
to grab a pipe on the other side. Instantly four of them are swarming 
up the walls, moving much faster  on pipes and ridges than the humans 
on ladders.

On one of the aliens a facehugger crawls, constantly moving about on 
the adult alien's head like a frightened spider.

CALL

Hurry!

WREN

It's jammed!  Shit!  Gun!

She hands him her gun and without hesitation he SHOOTS HER THROUGH THE 
CHEST.

She flies back and DOWN THE SHAFT, lands HARD on an elevator six 
stories below.

Eyes wide and empty.

VRIESS

NOO!

He fires up at Wren, but Wren has punched in the code and slipped 
through the opening door..

Ripley LEAPS through the air and grabs the ledge, hauling herself up 
just in time to see  the door shut.  The lock lights turn red.

She SLAMS against the door, but to no avail.

The aliens are getting closer.  St Just, the closest to the bottom, 
suddenly lets go of  the ladder.  His knees hooked over a rung, he 
drops, hangs up side down, his guns  filling his hands.

He blows several holes in the nearest alien.

Ripley is furious, maybe surprised just how so.  Suddenly an alien 
RISES OVER THE LEDGE, it's not three feet away from her and she 
SCREAMS, HURLS herself at it and they both go

FLYING OFF into-space, they hit the wall on the other side, they fall. 

RIPLEY GRABS a pole, it practically tears her arm out of her socket but 
she holds on, the alien isn't so lucky, it plummets unable to find 
puchase. We see it fall past  the unmoving body of Call.

ANGTE: CALLS FACE

As the facehugger CLAMPS onto it. Pauses. Pushes off a bit, two digits 
probing Call's nostrils.  Sensing no breath, the thing scurries away to 
find a better host.

Another alien is fast approching Christie and Vriess. Vriess 
frantically tries to reload.

VRIESS

It's on us!

Christie turns, aims -- Vriess grabs the ladder as Christie FIRES, but 
the alien is too close, it grabs Christie, spurting blood all over him.  
He SCREAMS, lets go of the ladder

Vriess takes the weight of both as Christie fires again, the alien 
flying off  and down the shaft.

HILLARD

We gotta go!

The last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers.

RIPLEY

We're locked in.

JOHNER 

Fuck!

PURVIS

How far to the next door?

DISTEPHANO

All the way.

RIPLEY

Then we climb.

They start, moving as fast as they can.

VRIESSS (to Christie)

You just hang on, man.  I'll get us there.

He starts climbing up, impressively fast considering the burden hanging 
from his back.

JOHNER (to Ripley)

Are they going for reinforcements?

RIPLEY

Fucked if I know.

They climb.

And climb, the minutes stretching out, still no door.  Ripley easily 
ahead of the rest.

Finally:

RIPLEY

I think I see the door.

PURVIS (exhausted)

Great.

Vriess is having increasing trouble.  Hillard notices him lagging 
behind, and why.

HILLARD

Vriess!  Jesus!

Vriess is moving very quickly, considering. But the effort is becoming 
too much.

VRIESS

We're coming...

Johner scrambles down next to Vriess.

he checks the pulse in Christie's neck.

Vriess, man... he's dead.

Refusing to hear it, Vriess struggles to climb further.

VRIESS

We'll get him to medlab... just a little while ...

Johner looks over at Hillard.  Without saying a word, she pull out a 
good-sized hunting  knife, flicks it open.

She slices through the cord holding them together, and Christie's body 
falls free.

Vriess shuts his eyes, feeling it.  ANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT

There is silence as Christie's body drops down the black abyss

Until, from up the shaft next to where he fell, we see two ALIENS 
COMING UP.

PURVIS

Fuck!  Company!

Hillard looks up the shaft.

HILLARD

How much further?,

JOHNER

Too fucking far.  Let's G0 !

They start to climb, but the aliens are making much better time.

A loud CLACKING sounds from the bottom of the shaft.  A few of them 
look down.

ANGLE: DOWN THE SHAFT

The aliens are still coming, but suddenly the lift passes them heading 
up at high speed.

JOHNER

They can work the elevators?  Is there anything fucking else we should 
know about them?!

He's addressing this at Ripley, but she's as puzzled as the rest of 
them.

The lift comes up to them, stops suddenly as emergency brake is 
flipped.

They wait, guns ready. Out of the hatch pops Call, not especially dead.

CALL

Get on!

A moment of stunned silence, then they all jump on top of the lift.

Call drops back down inside.

An alien comes up level with the lift, prepares to jump.  St Just 
shoots the shit out of it.

HILLARD

Where are the others?

CUT TO: INT.  LIFT - CONTINUOUS

Call flips the brake off, and the lift shoots up.  She is holding her 
jacket closed around  her chest wound, but it doesn't seem to bother 
her particularly much.

ANGLE: ON TOP

Everybody holds on as the lift flies up the shaft.

ANGLE: INSIDE

Call waits for the signal to stop and an alien PUNCHES THROUGH the 
bottom of the lift.  Call yells as it gets its head and an arm through, 
clawing for her.

ANGLE:	ON THE BOTTOM

We see the other half of the alien clinging to the lift.

ANGLE:	ON TOP

Ripley sees the door approaching

RIPLEY

stop!

ANGLE: INSIDE

Call hits the emergency button and the lift stops halfway in front of 
the door -

- giving both Ripley and Call access.  Bu the alien is still grabbing 
for her --

Ripley pries open the doors again, the crew pouring out into the hall. 
Ripley follows, jumps down and opens the lift doors

The alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs 
Call's ankle, but

Ripley wrenches her free.

They roll out but the alien is still fighting, Pulling itself inside 
the lift.

Ripley grabs Hillardl's shotgun.  Levels it at the cables holding the 
lift.  FIRES.

The lift PLUMMIETS, the alien still halfway in.

It shoots down the shaft -- picking up the second alien on its way 
down, neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as--

The lift SMASHES into the bottom of the shaft, crushing both the Aliens 
to jelly.

ANGLE:	UPPER DOOR

Johner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft.

JOHNER

Eat that, fuckneck!!

They all breathe hard, exhausted, before they can muster for the next 
stretch. 

Call stands with her back to them.

VRIESS

Baby, am I glad to see you.  I thought dickbag took you out for sure.  
Are you, hurt?

CALL

I'm fine.

DISTEPHANO

You got body armour on?

CALL

Yeah.  Come on.

Ripley isn't buying.

RIPLEY

You were Gunshot.  I saw.

CALL

I'm fine!

Ripley spins her around.  Call stares at Ripley, sullenly a small 
trickle of milky white fluid comes from her nostril. Ripley looks down.

ANGLE: CALL'S CHEST

Wren has indeed made a messy hole here, but where blood and bone should 
be there is a tangle of synthorganic wiring.  To state the obvious:

A robot.

JOHNER

Call's a goddam sythetic!

HILLARD

Son of a bitch.  Little Annalee's just full of surprises.

RIPLEY (quietly)

I should have known.

ST JUST

Couldn't smell this one out?

RIPLEY

No, I mean... all that crap about being human - there's no one so 
zealous as a Born Again.

VRIESS (to Call)

You're an LM7, aren't you?  Is that it?

CALL

Leave me alone.

Her voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by 
the wounds.

The voice is a shade slow, and echoes strangely.

VRIESS

Call ....

CALL (bitterly)

Yes.

ST JUST

LM7?  Shit.  That explains a lot.

YRIESS (to Ripley)

The latest and best.  They were supposed to revitalize the synthetic 
industy.

Instead they buried it.

Ripley looks at the girl.

RIPLEY

They were-too good.

VRIESS

Oh yeah.  Overrode their own behavioral inhibitors.  Didn't feel like 
being told what to do.

The government ordered a recall.  Fucking massacre.

HILLARD

1 always heard there were a few that got out alive, but man... I never 
thought I'd see one.

Johner starts laughing.

JOHNER

Oh, Christ.  Doing fucking nickel and dime border runs, selling second 
hand junk to the farm belt... and we're carrying the most expensive 
piece of contraband in the system.

That's rich.

PURVIS (getting anxious)

It's great, she's a toaster oven... Can we leave now?

Vriess tries to touch Call's wound.

VRIESS

Let me see.

Call pulls away.

JOHNER

Yeah, get your socket wrench, Vriess.

Maybe she just needs an oil change.

RIPLEY

Let's go.

They start off again, Johner and St Just bringing up the rear

JOHNER

Can't believe I almost fucked the thing.

ST JUST

Yeah, like you've never fucked a robot.

ANGLE: RIPLEY

Letting DiStephano lead.

RIPLEY

DiStephano.  Where are we?

DISTEPHANO

Upper decks... Storage... the chapell's up here, not much else.

RIPLEY

Can we get to the ship?

DISTEPHANO

Well, we're a ways out,of the way, but I think we can get through to 
the garden.

From there, it's down a few levels, it's do-able.

What if the fucking doctor gets there first?

VRIESS

It's a good point.

DISTEPHANO

Shit.

They have reached an access door.  Debris blocks the way.

RIPLEY

Another way?

DISTEPHANO

Uh, yeah.  Through the wall.  We'll have to get one of these panels 
off.  It'll take a while.

(to Vriess) You got tools?

VRIESS

Yeah, but no torch.

JOHNER

Fucking blow the door!

HILLARD

Assface, We're on the top of this thing.

(pointing to the ceiling)

That's hull.

VRIESS

What about Wren? if he gets in the computer he can really fuck us 
around.

RIPLEY

We have to get in too.

DISTEPHANO

There's no access console on this level. We'd have to-backtrack.

HILLARD

Fuck that.

DISTEPHANO

And I don't have the security access that Wren does anyway.

Ripley turns to Call.

RIPLEY

Call.

CALL

No. I can't.

JOHNER.

Bullshit.  She's a damn well talking machine.

CALL

There's another way.

DISTEPHMO

Just tell her to access it on remote.

VRIESS

Shit, that's right.  Any of the new model droids can access the 
mainframe.

JOHNER

Just by blinking.

CALL

I can't.

ST JUST

No time to get coy, Annalee.

CALL

I can't. I burned my modem drive.  We all did.

VRIESS

You can still patch in manually. You know that.

Call looks over at the group, staring at her.  She knows she doesn't 
have a choice.

DISTEPHANO

There's ports in the chapel.

RIPLEY

Come on.

(to the others)

You get started on that wall.

CUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOU@

Ripley and Call enter the small room.  Ripley sits in one of the pews, 
pulls out a bible.

it somewhat resembles a Newton Under the leather flap is a screen 
reading.:

HOLY BIBLE.  PRE START.

Ripley pulls out the cord from the bible's port, holds it up

CALL

Don't make me do this.

RIPLEY

Don't make me make you.

CALL

I don't want to go in there.

RIPLEY

Get over it.

CALL

It's like... your insides are liquid. It's not real.

RIPLEY

You can blow the ship.  Before it reaches Earth.  Kill them all.  Just 
give us time to get

out first.

That convinces Call.  She pulls up her sleeve, and begins. pushes a 
part of her forearm,

just below the crook of her elbow.  It has a spring release catch, and 
a small panel rises

up with two computer ports on it.  She takes the cable from Ripley and 
plugs it in.

It looks almost like she's mainlining heroin.

She cocks her head.

CALL

Dammit.

RIPLEY

Anything?

CALL

Hold on.

She reaches in her chest, reconnects some tubes.  She twitches then 
shuts her eyes.

It's beginning.

She begins speaking very rapidly, eyes still shut.

CALL

Breach in sector seven sector three sector nine unstable -- engines 
operating at eighty

six percent -forty six minutes until earthdock.

Her voice has a slight mechanical quality as she rattles this off.  Her 
eyes open.

CALL

We burned too much energy -- I can't make critical mass.  I can't blow 
it.

RIPLEY

Then crash it.

TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS

As the crew works at getting the wall panel off,.

TO: INT.  CHAPPEL   A BIT LATER

CALL

Ground level recalibrated... new destination 760, 403.  Done.  Forty 
one minutes until impact.

RIPLEY

Try to clear us a path to the ship.

CALL

Tracking movement in sublevels six through nine.  Video is down.  
Attempted rerouting

nonfunctional, wait, partial visual in waste tank 5, unauthorized 
presence...

VRIESS

Unauthorized?

CALL

Nonhuman.

RIPLEY

How many?

Please wait.. emergency override on. console 45V, level one... 
handprint ID...

(like herself)

It's Wren. 	He's almost at the Betty.

RIPLEY

And how do	you feel about that?

CUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS

Wren is holding his hand to the scanner, just as Call described.  The 
red light turns

green and we hear the locks the door crack open.

FATHER

Emergency override validated.

The door begins to rise.  Looking around him, Wren waits to through.

The door grinds to a halt, still too low to climb under.  The lights go 
out, only the faintest glow coming from various instrument panels. 
wren's expression drains.

WREN

Father, reboot systems on 45V, authorization 'starling'.

Nothing happens.  Wren looks about him, beginning to sweat.

Did the aliens do this?

WREN

Father, locate power drain, report.

Father?

CALL - (on the system)

Father's dead, asshole.

Wren spins in shock at the sound of Call's voice. it,s everywhere 
around him.

She has downloaded her vocal matrix place of Father's. 

(She's not just speaking over a PA, she is the PA.)

The door SLAMS back-down, locks clack into place.  The doors behind him 
open up, 

emergency lighting pulsing along toward him.

CALL\SHIP

Intruder on level one... all aliens please proceed to level one.

Wren is freaking.  He turns back down the corridor, looking about him 
wildly.

CUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

Call pulls the cord out of her port.

RIPLEY

You got a mean strak.

CALL

It's done.  That should hold the fuck.

This as her voice track slips even more.  She works the wires in her 
cheest, trying

to fix it.

RIPLEY

Let me see

CALL

Don't touch me.

Ripley backs off.

CALL

You must think this is pretty funny.

RIPLEY

Yes.  But I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.  And I'm not sure 
they are.

CALL

Why do you go on living?  How can you stand it?  How can you stand... 
yourself?

Ripley shrugs.

RIPLEY

Not so hard.  Not much choice.

CALL

At least there's part of you that's human.  I'm just... fuck.  Look at 
me....

She looks at the hole in her chest, the white and sticky fibers.

CALL

I'm disgusting.

Her voice is at its slowest here, low and eerie.  It's a mechanical 
problem, but 

it sounds just like despair.

RIPLEY

Do you dream?

CALL

I ... we have neural processors that run through....  (stops)  Yes.

RIPLEY

When I sleep, I dream about it.  Them.  Every night.  All around me ... 
in me. 

I used to be afraid to dream, but I'm not anymore.

CALL

Why?

RIPLEY

Because no matter how bad the dreams get ... when I wake up it's always 
worse.

Purvis enters.

PURVIS

I guess we're almost there.

RIPLEY

Right.

He exits again.  Call finishes fiddling with her internal wiring.  We 
hear her voice slip back to normal as she says:

CALL

Let's get going.

CUT TO: INT. TUNNEL

As they come one by one through the wall.

DISTEPHANO

Not far now.

PURVIS

God, I'm so tired...

JOHNER

Yeah, well, we'll sleep when we're dead.

Ripley follows him through.

RIPLEY

Don't count on it.

The rest of them come through and walk into:

INT.  THE GARDEN    CONTINUOUS

The Garden runs nearly half a mile straight across, and then down on a 
terraced slope.

Everywhere are different kinds of plants: trees, vegetable plants, 
exotic and experimental hybrids.

Access paths crisscross the beds.

It's huge, the single biggest space on the ship.  Yet the low ceiling, 
laticed with grow-lamps now dim in nightcycle, and prodigeous 
undergrowth make it labyrinthian, almost claustrophobic.

From where the crew is, they can barely see where it slopes down.

JOHNER

What's this fucking deal?

DISTEPHMO

This supplies most of the food for the unit.

VRIESS (holding a lucious ripe pear)

You guys got something against spam?

DISTEPHMO

And there's some lab work here too. Hybridization.

RIPLEY

At the other end?

DISTEPHMO

Runs down to the by the waste tanks.  We can get to the dock from 
there.  You, okay?

Ripley is holding her head.  She shuts her eyes.

CALL

What is it?

Ripley shakes it off.

RIPLEY

Nothing.  I'm okay.

She looks out at the jungle, they have to cross.

CALL

We should get moving.

ST JUST

Hey!  Check it out!

He has come upon a small loading truck, a sort of platform jeep.  
Vriess checks it out, takes a huge bite of his pear.

VRIESS

Beats walking.

He hauls himself up-into it. Everybody piles onto the back flatbed just 
a foot or so off the ground and just big enough to hold everyone but 
Vriess, Call and Ripley, who pushes into the driver's seat.

VRIESS

Quickly and quietly, people.

Ripley stares unconprehendingly at the controls for a momen till Call 
flips on the ignition.

RIPLEY

Thank,you.

The jeep pulls out.  It's electric, so it emits just a low hum as she 
takes it at a good clip toward the other side.

The access paths are just a bit wider than the jeep itself, plants 
rising tall all around them.

Ripley concentrates on driving.

The pass through as section of wheat , then of corn.  As they come to 
another section,

The crew's expressions change to one of pleased disbelief.

You gotta be fucking me. St Just!  Is this real?

ST JUST

So this is what heaven looks like.

We see they have driven into a healthy section of CANNABIS plants 
growing ten feet high.

The car screeches to a halt.  Ripley's at a crossroads of sorts.

RIPLEY

Which way?

HILLARD (looking at the plants)

I always wondered where the military got its funding...

An alien SHOOTS out of the brush and lands on Hillard everyone SCREAMS 
-- Ripley SLAMS her foot on the pedal

The jeep PEELS OUT, as more emerge from the brush.

HILLARD

Get it off MeeeaaaaAAGGHRE!!!!

It bores into her head before St Just can blow it away. It's head 
exploding in fragments of bone and sizzling blood as it falls away from 
the jeep, Hillard's body still clutched in arms.

Another leaps out at them, but the jeep is going a good clip and it 
misses.

The crew peppering it with bullets.

They look,about them, guns ready.

ANGLE: IN THE BRUSH

Something runs parallel to them in the plants.

ANGLE: ABOVE

Two more run on top of the grow-lamps, pacing them as well.

One DROPS DOWN -- Ripley SWERVES out of the way, driving in the plants.

They are varied, exotic -- and there are aliens behind half of them.

The crew BLASTS away all around them Ripley drives a drunkard's path 
through the brush, avoiding trees that dot the scape.

An alien DROPS onto the hood, another grabs the side -- Vries takes out 
the first, blowing it off, but the second grabs Johner, he goes flying 
over the side,.dropping his gun.

St Just is too preoccupied with his own problems on the othe to see 
that Johner is being

dragged, the alien still clutching onto him.

Shots bang out, ripping into the alien, which lets go. Johner looks up 
to see Purvis  holding Johner's gun.

Johner drags himself back on.

One jumps down onto St Just, tears a good chunk out of his midsection 
before he dusts it.

Another alien jumps on the hood just as the jeep SAILS over first ledge 
of the terraced  slope, comes-down hard enough knock it off, SAILS over 
the next -- the crew can barely hang on as the jeep crashes down slope 
after slope. 

Ripley swerves back onto the road, the jeep sliding over onto the steps 
beside it, rocking violently as they shoot down the remainder of slope, 
the aliens close on their heels.

Still blasting away at the beasts, the crew is able to put little 
distance between them as they come to the end of the garden.  Here it 
divides into three sections, all open halls with access for the jeep.

RIPLEY

Which way?

DISTEPRMO (looking over)

Left!  Left!

She swerves left, the jeep-bouncing into the hall

INT.  HALL CONTINUOUS

Where windows running along either side look out onto black space.

Ripley drives as far as she can, till a staircase -- going -- fills her 
vision, too steep

for the jeep.  She SLAMS on brakes. the jeep spinning out and coming to 
a halt.

The crew piles out, Di Stephano grabbing Vriess.  At the other end of 
the hall, the aliens

can be seen approaching.

The crew BLASTS at them, the aliens, blood splattering the narrow hall.

ANGLE: THE BLOOD

Eating into the walls. the floor.

CALL/Ship

Warning. potential hullbreach.  Clear sector.

DISTEPHANO (indicating the steps)

Down here!

They start down -- all but St Just.  He gets out of the jeep with 
difficulty.

Looks down at his wound.

Johner looks around to see him still standing atop the steps

JOHNER

St Just!  Come on, man.

St Just looks down at the wound. Back at Johner.  He walks calmly away, 
towards the aliens.

CALL

St Just!

ST JUST

You go.

He looks at the appraching aliens.

ST JUST

I'm bored.

 CALL\SHIP

Warning.  Evacuate sector.

A moment, then the crew takes off.

St Just takes a handful of pills, pops them into his mouth.  Only the 
slightest  grin suffuses his face ,as he waits for the aliens.

They close on him, and he raises his guns.

CALL\SHIP

warning...

CUT TO:

INT HALL NEARBY - CONTINUOUS

The crew runs full out.

DISTEPHANO

We have to get out of the sector!

RIPLEY

Where!

DISTEPHANO

There!

He points at a door that's down two flights and across the hall.

CUT TO: INT. HALL CONTINUOUS

The aliens close, and St Just FIRES, blasting away with bot guns.  
Aliens writhe on the

floor before him, still they cover the bodies of their brothers, still 
he fires, 

Call\ship monotones of warning in sharp contrast to the chaos

-- St Just fires until both guns are empty.  In one smooth motion he 
drops them both 

and jerks his wrists and TWO-MORE disposable guns fly into his palms 
and he blasts away

ANGLE: THE BLOOD

Eating through the hull.

ANGLE: THE CREW

desperately racing for the door.

ANGLE: ST JUST

Firing with quiet glee.

ANGLE: THE CREW

The first of them are through the door.

ANGLE: St JUST

The aliens are getting closer, but still he mows them down Both his 
guns click, spent.

ST JUST

Damn.

CALL\SHIP

Warning --

and BOOM!!!!, the hall BURSTS OPEN, everything explodes into space, the 
wind rushes out as

BOOM!!!, the whole garden sector rips open, sucked out, as

ANGLE: RIPLEY

is the last to get out, but the pressure change SUCKS HER she flies 
backwards, the section door coming down just in time as she SLAMS into 
it, the door closing fully as she falls, lack of pressure sucks at the 
door itself, it creaks and be inward slightly, but it holds.

The others have exited into the next hall.  They've been tossed about, 
but not as badly.

Call stops, runs back to Ripley, helps her up.  Ripley is dazed; the 
door hit the back of her head solidly.

CALL

Can you walk?  RIPLEY

I think I...

CALL

I'm not fucking carrying you

Ripley doesn't even hear her; something else drowns Call out. Ripley 
puts her hands over her ears.

RIPLEY

Mistake ... mistake...

CALL

Ripley.

RIPLEY

I can hear them, in the hive... it's close...	We're on the hive.

CALL

Jesus.  Come on.

RIPLEY

I can hear them... the queen...

CALL

What... ?

RIPLEY

She's in pain.

They CRASH UP through the floor panels, six of them, surrounding the 
two women.

Call can barely spin before Ripley GRABS her and HURLS her fifteen feet 
down the corridor, out of harm's way.

The aliens close on Ripley. She struggles but she's still weak.  One 
slams her onto the ground call recovers, looks back at Ripley

As the aliens drag her unconscious body back down under the floor.

CALL

RIPLEY!

CUT TO: INT.  AIR VENT - CONINUOUS

Dark, cramped, and already covered with a hardening layer of resin.

Skittering, insectile motion at one end heralds the aliens, as two of 
them crawl rapidly along.   The third craw upside down, the 
semiconscious Ripley draped over its chest  If she were awake, and 
out.vf her mind, she could be kissin the beast.

Her eyes flutter open, but she is obviously still groggy.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S POV

Alien head, dark tunnel passing beneath.

Scuttling through a small maze, the aliens come out into:

INT.  WASTE TANK 5 - CONTINUOUS

A vast, dark chamber, entirely encrusted with alien goo. air vent opens 
about three quarters of the way up the chamber. The aliens pour out and 
imediately scuttle UP, carrying Ripley to the top of the chamber.

They circle her and begin secreting resin, spinning a web around her.

The resin comes out of ther backs in spits and globs.

It isn't pleasant, and Ripley struggles feebly as they begin to cocoon 
her.

CUT TO: INT.  ANTECHAMBER   CONTINUOUS

The crew piles through it on their way to the loading dock.

Call brings up the rear, still looking back regretfully.

She hesitates, and Purvis takes hold of her arm.

PURVIS

We got to be moving, miss.  Best gift you can give her right now is a 
quick death.

CALL

It's not right...

PURVIS

I've been saying that all day, we need your help.

A moment more, and she heads out with him.

CUT TO: WASTE, TANK 5 - CONTINUOTJS

The aliens have finished webbing Ripley, and climb away. 

When it is done she finds herself basically hung from the ceiling, her 
legs encased and glued with glistening strands to the roof. She hangs 
therefore at an angle, looking down on the chamber. 

And so it is with her, as she swims to full consciousness, we get our 
first real look at where we are.

There are no less than ten people strung up exactly as Ripley is, 
encircling the chamber, and all looking some forty feet down at:

The Queen.  Lying on her back at the bottom of the-chamber, belly 
swollen and distended.

She is herself partially cocooned, strapped down to the at the edge of 
a black pool of blood and ichor.  Her head moves slowly back and forth, 
in delierium of pain.

There are a four or five aliens tending her, spinning goo around her, 
vomiting blood onto her belly. They might be serving her, or 
imprisoning her.  Both, in fact.

There is one thing missing from this tableau.

RIPLEY (softly)

No eggs ...

GEDIMAN (OS)

Multiple reproductive systems.

Ripley turn's slowly, to see the person next to her.  It's Gediman, 
looking wane and haggard.

He may be speaking to her but he stares straight ahead, his eyes 
glowing with near insanity.

GEDIMAN

Complete asexual reproductive cycle, self-impregnating, we found six 
different sets of ovaries in her.  Egg laying is the first cycle, 
immature.  Redundancies, redundancies

... she'll bring forth legion.

RIPLEY

They didn't impregnate you?

Now he looks at her, regret and glee at what has happened battling for 
his expression.

GEDIMAN

No... they've just been draining me.

She looks down, to see

ANGLE : GEDIMAN'S FEET

As blood from various wounds seeps slowly past his toes, dripping into 
the pool.

A keening SHRIEK comes out of the queen, as her limbs begin thrashing.

The aliens around her back off slightly. 

The bulge in her belly starts moving.

Ripley starts struggling with her bonds, terror and determination in 
her.eyes.

RIPLEY

I'm getting	out of here. Goddamnit, I'm getting the	fuck out of here!

He looks at her, the last glimmerof his sanity sinking beyond the 
horizon.

GEDIMAN

Don't you want to see what happens next?

CUT TO: INT: LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

The crew rushes in, heads for the Betty.

JOHNER

How long till we can get airborn?

VRIESS

I'll need Call to patch in to the ship again, open the hatch.

CALL

Right.

JOHNER

We hit atmo in a few minutes, only gonna make it harder.

They all run on board

INT.  THE BETTY

and head for the cockpit.  DiStephano deposits Vriess in a wheelchair.

CALL

Johner, take Purvis to the freezer.

JOHNER

All right.. Nap time, buddy.

A GUNSHOT and Purvis goes flying, blood spurting out of his shoulder, 
Johner draws but

Wren emerges from the shadows too fast.

Wren grabs Call and very carefully holds his gun to her back right 
below her shoulderblades.

WREN

Fuck with me and I put a bullet where her brain is!

Johner stands, uncertain.

WREN

DiStephano!  Take their weapons.

DISTEPHANO

Begging your pardon, sir, but eat my fuck.

DiStephano aims at Wren.  Wren backs up a step.

WREN

Drop it!  Drop it or we all die together!

Heaped in the, corner, Purvis suddenly jerks forward.  His eyes go 
wide.

CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5   CONTINUOUS

Ripley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds.  It's just beginning 
to work.

But the noise in here is getting worse, the aliens franitcally agitated 
as the Queens belly begins moving more violently.  SHRIEKS, and RIPLEY 
does as well, from effort or sympathy, it is hard to tell, as

THE QUEENS BELLY POPS OPEN.  Blood shoots everywhere, burning into the 
walls.

And all the screaming stops.  The movement stops.  Even Ripley stops.  
Silence.

Something emerges from the wound.

An alien, to be sure, but nothing we've seen so far, its forelegs arch 
out of its back like spiders legs, its back legs set on enormous 
haunches, thick and powerful.

Its head is long, eyeless, like the others, but along its white expanse 
red veins, coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to 
the back.

It has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its 
tongue does.

Its much bigger the the others, nearly the size of the queen herself.

And it's bone white.

GEDIMAN

Beautiful.... beautiful butterfly...

He is crying with revelatory joy.  Ripley is not.  Grimacing the sight 
and smell of the new beast, she begins pulling again at her bonds.

One of the soldiers, at the 'other end of the room from Ripley wakes 
up.

Dangling uselessly at his side is a rifle -- the real deal, not a 
burner.

SOLDIER

No, God...

He SCREAMS in uncomprehending horror.  The newborn stops, tilting its 
head:

It LEAPS up to the ceiling in a second, quick and effortless as a 
monstrous flea.

Leaps again and lands on the screaming soldier, gripping his sides with 
its four forelegs as he screams lustily.

pincers SWING out and pin either side of his head.. His eyes go wide 
as:

Its tongue SHOOTS into his throat.  Stays there, and we watch it drain 
the blood from his body.  We can see it, see its stomach swell, red 
tinged, as his body goes

blue and slack. His rifle drops into the black pool.

Gediman stares, transfixed, and it LANDS ON HIM.

CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS

Johner's gun drops to the floor.

Everyone backs off.

WREN

The fucking robot is going to plug back into the Auriga and land it 
according to standard operational procedure.

CALL

No she's not.

DISTEPHMO

You're fucking nuts.  You still want to bring those things back to 
earth?

JOHNER

Have you been paying any attention today?

WREN

I can handle the animals!

CALL

Fucking shoot me.

WREN

Shut up!!!

And Purvis LAUNCHES from the corner, screaming, jumps on wren - Wren 
gets off a couple of shots -- nails DiStephano in the face.  The 
soldier drops like a sack.

The other shots hit the ship, Call dives for cover as Purvis SLAMS his 
fist across Wren's face, Wren fires again and Jo is on the ground, 
rolling, grabbing his gun --

Purvis is a man possessed.  He grabs Wren's gunhand and SMAS it against 
an instrument panel, bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun.

Purvis jerks.  Blood blooms in his chest.

Everybody stops, mesmerized. wren drops to his knees, going for the 
gun, and Purvis grabs him from behind, pulls him so that the back of 
Wren's head is against his chest.

Purvis jerks again.  It takes Wren a moment to understand what's 
happening.

They both scream.

Then alien BURSTS out of Purvis's chest, STRAIGHT INTO WRENS SKULL.

Everyone else is still frozen.  Then the little critter bursts out of 
Wrens face, flying straight at Vriess.  CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5 - 
CONTINUOUS

Ripley TEARS one of her arms free as the newborn feeds beside her.

Gediman is already a shell.

Having drained the scientist, it leaps blindingly fast onto the 
ceiling.  Looks around.

Targets Ripley.

It has no eyes, but she can feel them on her anyway.  She rips at her 
bonds with a terrible effort -- the newborn LEAPS at her and she PULLS 
FREE with a scream, PLUNGING  the thirty feet to the pool as the alien 
flies over her, missing, landing on the far wall instead.

Ripley disappears beneath the surface of the water.

The newborn turns its head, trying to locate its lost prey. other 
aliens scutter closer to the pool.

Ripley stands up out of the pool, covered in blood, HOISTING THE 
SOLDIERIS GUN.

Killshriek rising from her throat as she FIRES, taking out a host of 
aliens in a single sweep, just tagging the newborn as it leaps out of 
the way.  Aliens jump at her, trying to kill and trying to protect the 
newborns, but she blows them out of the air.

It feels pretty good.

A few shots go wild, and punch big holes in the side of the tank.

Light streams in through them.  Ripley sees -- and continues firing in 
that direction.

She makes a big enough hole that she can run and SMASH through to

INT.  BY TANK - CONTINUOUS

rolling and coming up in an instant.  She looks around her. exit this 
way, but there is a vent above her.

The newborn's head lunges at her, the small hole making it impossible 
for the creature to get all the way through.  But it wriggles, 
pushing...

Ripley jumps up, grabbing a pipe, and KICKS open the vent grate, 
throwing herself up the vertical shaft with astonishing ease.

CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS---

Vriess is scrambling away, knocking over things to avoid the baby 
alien. 

Johner SHOOTS at the creature as it speeds-towards Vriess.

CALL

Don't shoot it!  Betty's hull is too thin!

JOHNER

Look out!

it knocks over cannisters as it speeds across the table and behind some 
instruments.  VRIESS

Where'd it go?

CALL

Don't shoot it!

JOHNER

Fuck that!

It LEAPS out of the darkness and heads straight for Call, she stumbles 
back, trips -- it comes at her, leaps right at her face, she pulls her 
hand back -- and-flicks her wrist The stilletto pops out as the creatu 
flies at it, the blade slides right into its mouth, ramming eight 
inches through its innards before it pokes out the other end.

Blood spurts on Call, on the floor.  The creature wriggles and finally 
falls free as the stilletto melts inside it.

JOHNER

Vriess!  Get behind the fucking wheel!

CUT TO: INT.  VERTICAL AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Ripley is climbing up the cramped vent with the speed and agility of an 
alien.

Unfortunately, so are the aliens, twenty feet below her.  Two drones in 
front, with the newborn sqeezing close behind.

Ripley grabs a pole and her hand begins to steam, it's so hot. She 
cries out, lets go...  then looks down.  Grabs the pole again and, 
ignoring the searing agony, pulls, pulls...

RIPS out of the wall, burning steam GUSHING out below her, slowing down 
the aliens.

She continues climbing, then kicks through a grate.

CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

The Auriga races toward:

EARTH.  But not as we've seen it.

The planet is still blue, but almost two thirds of it is obscured by a 
giant orbitting latticework of metal, a part shell that rotates sligtly 
faster than the  planet itself.

The Auriga heads for a section of exposed earth.  Not long now.

CUT TO: INT.  ANTE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Ripley drops to the ground and heads for the dock.

CALL/SHIP

Airlock doors closing.  Stand clear.

RIPLEY

No!

She doesn't bother to try the door, she HURLS herself through the 
window, landing

INT.  DOCKING BAY

in a hail of glass.

She is on the platform that. runs the length of the dock.  Betty. is 
barely visible past the far end, - sinking into the airlock as the 
massive airlock doors. slide slowly shut.

RIPLEY

NO!!

A SLAM against the metal door behind her tells her the aliens are here.

She picks herself up and RUNS -- and she can run fast.

Speeds across the platform, faster, faster, the Betty sinks of sight as 
the airlock doors move closer together, fifteen feet apart, ten...

Ripley reaches the edge of the platform and LEAPS, just hurls herself 
off of the platform, sails through the air, thirty, forty feet, and 
down, the airlock doors thirty feet below almost closed

She DROPS right through just before they close, falls another fifteen 
feet and lands

-- WHAM!! -- on top of-the Auriga, hard, rolls, lies there in extremes 
of pain.

CUT TO:

INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS

The crew look up at the sound.

VRIESS

Something's on us!

JOHNER

Forget it!	we'll shake it off on descent.

Airlock secure.  Outer doors opening... . CUT TO:

INT.  AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

Ripley tries to pick herself up, is momentarily too wiped. breathes 
heavily,

gets to her knees.

ANGLE: FROM ABOVE-

we see Ripley crawling toward the hatch, and the huge outer airlock 
door opening beneath the ship.  Blue sky and wind the screen below.

ANGLE: RIPLEY

Struggling to get to the hatch.

RIPLEY

God'...

And above her, through a window into the docking bay, we see the 
newborn appear.

CUT TO: INT.  BETTY - CONTINUOUS

CALL

Almost there...

JOHNER

We got about forty seconds till we kiss the ground!

Go full thrust on the downdraft!  We'llget clear!

JOHNER

It's gonna be fucking close.

CALL\SHIP

Warning.  Procedural interruption.  Ship not leveling for vertical 
drop.  Braking

system nonfunctional.  Collision imminent.

JOHNER

No shit.

CALL

Almost there.

CUT TO:

INT.  AIRLOCK - CONTINUOUS

The airlock doors are almost.. completely open.  Ripley has reached the 
hatch, but cannot get it open.  She pounds on it frustration -- and the 
newborn SMASHES through the window,

JUMPS DOWN onto the ship.

RIPLEY

NOO!!  NOOO!

CUT TO:

INT.  BETRY - CONTINUOUS

CALL

NOW!!!

Vriess punches it

CUT TO:

INT.  AIRLOCK\EXT.  SKY CONTINUOUS

and the Betty SHOOTS DOWN out of the airlock -- Ripley and the newborn 
just barely hold on, Ripley's body thrown straight up as she grips the 
hatch door for dear life.

The newborn has a better grip -- it has more things to grip with but it 
too struggles with the sudden drop.

ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA

Speeding toward the earth.  The Betty SHOOTS out the airlock and nearly 
smashes into the bottom of the ship as it passes, like trash thrown out 
of a speeding car.

INT.  BETTY

The Akiriga passes, huge above them

VRIESS

Look out!

CALL

I am!

EXT.  THE BETTY

The ship swerves as Call expertly avoids the Auriga -- and see Ripley 
and the newborn on top, still fighting for purchase

The Betty gets clear, leveling out --

The Auriga still heads straight for earth, as the terrain below becomes 
clear -

- deserted, snow covered mountains

ANGLE: RIPLEY

Hanging on

ANGLE: CALL

Fighting to control the Betty

ANGLE:	INSIDE THE AURIGA

Deserted halls, passageways bodies, and,aliens milling here and there

CALL\SHIP

Collision in six seconds ... five... four...

(softly)

Here we go...

ANGLE: THE ATJRIGA

SMASHES INTO THE GROUND, a deafening exposion eating the massive ship 
in seconds, utter cacophony.

ANGLE: THE BETTY

Flying away, the thundering firestorm behind it.

ANGLE: CALL

An instrument panel suddenly SPARKS beside her warning lights flash, 
the ship shaking as if under massive turbulence

CALL

Johner!  Fire!

VRIESS

Vector control's fucked! we gotta put down!

CALL

Find me a path!

Johner sprays foam on the fire.  There is a loud BANGING heard far 
overhead.

What the fuck is that?

ANGLE: RIPLEY

is slamming her fist on the hatch doors, hanging on with her other arm.

The ship continues to tremble and buck -- she's nearly thrown off.

RIPLEY

Godamnit!

She looks around at the alien.  It's almost on her.

Working its way painfully toward her, gripping with its legs and 
tendrils.  Hissing.

It slams a tentacle down at Ripley, but she rolls, just holding on

ANGLE: JOHNER

Above the cockpit, looking at a fuzzy external monitor.

JOHNER

It's Ripley!  Ripley's on the fucking hatch!

In the cockpit, Call nearly goes white.

CALL

Let her in!

JOHNER

Fuck no!  There's something else out there with her!

VRIESS

One of them.

Johner looks at the image, realizes how masive the newborn is. 

Awed fear creeps into his voice: 

JOHNER

No. it's something else.

Frustrated, Call jumps out of her seat.. Vriess fights to control the 
ship as she  climbs up toward the hatch.

VRIESS

Goddamnit, Call!

Johner grabs her, practically throws her at the monitor.

JOHNER

Look at that fucking thing!  We can't open up!

They both tumble as the ship jerks

ANGLE: RIPLEY

Is bucked OFF THE SHIP

before she grabs the newborn's tentacle, holds on to it --

The newborn SMASHES it against he ship, trying to shake her again -

- she grabs an external grate and starts climbing painfully away.

ANGLE: CALL

Pushes Johner aside as she makes for the hatch release sequence.

ANGLE: VRIESS.

Desperately pulling up as wooded, snowy mountains zoom dangerously 
close below.

ANGLE: THE ALIEN

Turns as the HATCH OPENS nearby, the door sliding slowly beast is torn 
between Ripley and this new distraction --

Ripley sees it too, starts climbing for it frantically, one on the 
newborn.

The beast makes for the doorway -- and CALL POPS HALFWAY OUT pointing a 
GRENADE LAUNCHER  at the thing.. She BLASTS it once,  the beast roaring 
and starting back, hurt but not nearly enough.  Call fires again but 
the ships rocking sends the shot wild.

she flies back for all of a second

The beast rears to attack but Ripley is at the hatch -- Call drags her 
in and closes the hatch, the beast just SLAMMING in it as it closes.

INT.  THE BETTY

Ripley is hanging on Call, exhausted.

Another BANG on the hatch, and they can see the door starting to give.

VRIESS

Call!  NOW!

Call and Ripley head into the cockpit.Johner continues looking at the 
vidscreen at the beast.

VRIESS

We can't to do a vertical setdown! Braking systems are shot!

CALL

Find me a patch of land!  I'll put her down.

Call jumps back into the pilot's seat by Vriess.  He pulls up hard on 
the wheel, but the ship is still dangerously close to the ground.

JOHNER

That thing isn't going anywhere!

VRIESS

Johner, strap in!  We're coming down hard!

ANGLE:     -BETTY  Approaches the rough, wooded terrain, just above the 
trees.  Hits a relatively clear patch, touches down -- bounces back up 
and then down again

ANGLE: CALL

Fighting the wheel -- she can't pull it up hard enough.

ANGLE: THE BETTY

The ship blasts through trees.  The newborn moves to the back of the 
ship to avoid debris.

JOHNER

That things gone back behind the thrusters!

Call and Ripley look at each other.

RIPLEY

Hit it.

Call throws on the thrusters, the ship ROCKETS forward   ANGLE: THE 
NEWBOM

Engulfed in flame, losing its grip --

THE BETTY

Going too fast -- Call can't control it

VRIESS

Kill thrust! Now!

Call does.

ANGLE: THE BETTY

Skids, skids, throwing up enormous debris.  It hits another wooded area

RIPLEY

is thrown bodily into the windshield --

THE BETTY

mows down a half acre of trees before finally grinding to a halt.

As soon as they've recovered, Call throws off her seatbelt.

CALL Is everbody all right-?

JOHNER

Where're you going?

Call opens the hatch.

CALL

To make sure that thing is really dead

Its giant face LUNGES down at her, piston tongue shooting out.

It has charred black skin -- in some places that skin has fallen off 
and wet pink flesh shows through.

Call drops to the floor, the tongue just missing her.  Johner scrambles 
for his gun as

Ripley drags her out of the way.

AS quickly as it came, the head lurches back out.

JOHNER

I think it's gone!

VRIESS

No, it's waiting for us to come out!

Can we fly?

VRIESS

We can't fucking crawl!

RIPLEY

It's gone.

Call looks at her.

CALL 

Are you sure?

JOHNER

Good!  Great!

CALL

No...

Call grabs a grenade launcher.

CALL

I've got to stop it.

VRIESS

Call

CALL

That thing is thirty minutes old!  In a few hours it'll grow up.  If it 
reaches a place with people...

She heads for the door but Ripley is on her way.  They exchange a look.

RIPLEY

You'll never catch it.

Call tosses her the grenade launcher.

CUT TO: EXT.  BETTY - MOMENTS LATER

The ship sits silent in the woods, the trees around heavy with snow.

Ripley comes out the top.  She looks around her, sees the tracks in the 
snow.

Huge, loping.  She jumps.down off the ship.

And runs.

Through the blur of trees, she moves with the grace and speed of an 
animal, leaping from boulders, racing through the powdered brush this 
is Ripley at peak speed, and it is something to see.

She starts going up, the way getting steeper and rockier, til she 
reaches a cliff face, and looks out on:

A CITY.

Sprawling, huge, a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes it's 
just before  the horizon.

The newborn RISES in front of Ripley, STRIKES her before she has a 
chance to aim her weapon.

Its tentacle cuts deeply into her, sends her flying.

The beast is on her in a second, its enormous jaws missing her head by 
an inch as she rolls, grabs the grenade launcher, FIRE

The beast is thrown, but just grazed, back on her as she tries to get 
off another shot, it SLAMS a foot down RIGHT ON HER she SCREAMS, the 
launcher rolls free, the beast coming in for the kill and over the 
ridge FLIES THE HARVESTER, Call at the controls. aiming right  for the 
newborn.

It rears up to see it just as the girl RAMS it into the creatures head, 
it knocks it on its ass, the harvester shaking but not quite spinning 
out, as Call comes around for another shot.

Ripley scrambles to safety as the Newborn prepares for the oncoming 
harvester, it whips its tentacles at it but Call swerves at the last 
second -- The monster spins with it, screaming, sees Ripley and slashes 
at her.  KNOCKS HER OFF THE CLIFF --

She falls, grabs brush it snaps -- she starts slinding down rockface 
and she takes her hand, SLAMS her fingers into the smooth rock face 
like a pick axe -- it rips her nails bloody but she digs out purchase.

ANGLE: CALL

SLAMS into the newborn from behind, the girl nearly thrown out of the 
harvester, the newborn spins and grabs it, Call throws it into reverse 
but the newborn is too strong, holds on, bringing its head up to face 
Call herself.

ANGLE: RIPLEY'S

Bloody and torn, it SMASHES into the rockface, as she climbs back to 
the top

ANGLE: THE NEWBORN

SWINGS the harvester into a tree, Call nearly knocked loose again. The 
monster is jolted as well, lets go, Call pilots the machine back 
through the trees, the alien watching it, growling --

Call flies deftly through the trees, away, away, then spins out, heads 
back for the beast at TOP SPEED, the wind roars as she closes

The newborn spins and she SLAMS into it, it goes flying, screaming in 
pain,  the harvester bouncing off it, flipping over, CRASHING against 
the trees and landing tilted upside down, Call unconscious between it 
and the ground.

The newborn shudders, rises, makes for the harvester -- it clearly 
pissed.

Ripley pulls herself over the ridge, sees the situation, rushes toward 
them.

Call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine.  Terrified, 
but determined, she reaches for a lever

RIPLEY

No! Over here!

Calling out to distract it, she runs, waving her arms.

CALL

Ripley!  Let it come!  Let it come!

Tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever. The beast is 
torn, and for a  moment doesn't move.

Ripley looks over to where Call is, and understanding blooms on her 
face.

She looks around and spots:

ANGLE: THE GRENADE LAUNCHER

Halfway between her and the newborn.

For a moment neither of them moves.  Then Ripley RUNS, the newborn 
comes at her with equal speed, like they're playing chicken, Ripley 
DIVES at the ground, rolls, comes up holdin the grenade launcher, and 
she FIPES!

The newborn is hit up close and dead center this time, and it rears 
back, screaming -

- Ripley FIRES and FIRES, driving it back toward the upended harvester.

The alien rears up to its full height, and Ripley pulls.the trigger.  
There is a hollow click.

Furious, Ripley stares a moment at the beast.  A SSCREAM wells up in 
her throat and she 

THROWS herself at it, leaping impossibly high, smashing into it and 
sending both  of them tumbling onto the Harvester.

Call pulls the lever.

In an instant the machine roars to life, a thousand blades grinding to 
top speed, pulverizing the beast, consuming it, sucking it down as 
layer upon layer of alien flesh is chopped into messes.

And it SHRIEKS, a noise unheard before, as it thrashes frantically.

Ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close -- 
but the beast grabs her, holds her.  The blades ever closer as she 
struggles with it.

ANGLE: CALL

Still trapped below, she sees the aliens blood seeping through the 
machine all around her!

She squirms, trying to get away, but she's stuck.  A stream of blood 
lands on her shoulder, eating it away.  Another on her leg, and panic 
blooms, bright in her.

CALL

RIPLEY!

Galvanized by the cry, Ripley TEARS herself out of the beast's dying 
grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it begins to smoke and 
spark, blood eating through the controls.

Call writhes, blood everywhere now.  She is lost in primal terror.

Ripley wriggles her way under, and, regardless of the streams of blood 
splattering her, wrenchs Call free.  She drags her' out.

A section of the harvester explodes, raining fire and debris or the 
dying alien.

Call lies on the ground, Ripley behind her, arms wrapped tight around 
her.

Covered in blood and grime, the two watch the alien go up in flames, 
breathing hard,  holding each other as if their lives depended on it 
still.

DISSOLVE TO.- ANGLE: THE NEWBORN'S SKULL

Burning, hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it.  Collapsing 
gently on itself.

WIDE ANGLE:

EXT.  SAME - LATER

The four of them sit by the huge camp-fire, watching the flames.

Vriess tosses 'Christie a bottle of whiskey.

JOHNER

The bitch takes her time in burning.

VRIESS

Well, it looks like she's finally giving it up.

JOHNER

Troopers should be finding our ship any time now. 1 don't much love the 
idea of being around when they do.

Ripley gets up, looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city.

Christie offers the bottle to Call.  She takes it and drinks.

VRIESS (to Call)

I guess you won't want to be answering any official Questions either.

CALL

I guess not.

She is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together.

VRIESS 

Well, we're on Earth, for Chrissake. Plenty of places to get lost here.

CALL

So I've heard.

After a moment, she gets up as well, goes over to Ripley.  She hands 
her the bottle.

Ripley looks at it.

CALL

It's a drink.  You drink it.

RIPLEY (smiling) I remember. She drinks.

CALL

So, what do you think?

RIPLEY

Think?

CALL

What should we do now?

RIPLEY

I don't know.

She looks out in the distance...

RIPLEY I'm a stranger here myself

The two of them stand side by side staring out at the unfamiliar 
horizon, as the newborn dwindles in the dancing flame.

        SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE                            1

        Silent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of
        God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip
        of technology.

        CLOSER SHOT  It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the
        ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior
        or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING
        of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow
        engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing
        over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
        toward it.

        INT. NARCISSUS                                            2

        Dark and dormant as a crypt.  The searchlights stream
        in the dusty windows.  Outside, massive metal forms can
        BE SEEN descending around the shuttle.  Like the tolling
        of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through
        the hull.

        CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR  Light glares as a cutting
        torch bursts through the metal.  Sparks shower into the
        room.

        A second torch cuts through.  They move with machine
        precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging.  The
        torches meet.  Cut off.  The door falls inward REVEALING
        a bizarre multi-armed figure.  A ROBOT WELDER.

        FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous.  THREE MEN in
        bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment.  They
        approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.

                                   LEADER
                           (filtered)
                    Internal pressure positive.  Assume
                    nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep
                    capsules, style circa late twenties...

        His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
        canopy.

        ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE  as light stabs in where the dust is
        wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful
        repose.

        WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo.
        Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.

                                   LEADER
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Lights are green.  She's alive. 
                    Well, there goes out salvage, guys.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION    3 

        She's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female MED-TECH
        raises the backrest.  She is surrounded by arcane white
        MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.  The Med-Tech exudes practiced
        cheeriness.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Why don't I open the viewport?
                    Watch your eyes.

        Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
        called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
        from high orbit.  Blue and serene.

                                   MED-TECH
                    And how are we today?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (weakly)
                    Terrible.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just terrible?  That's better
                    than yesterday at least.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long have I been on
                    Gateway station?

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just a couple of days.  Do you
                    feel up to a visitor?

        Ripley shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a MAN
        enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying.
        A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Jones!

        She grabs the cat like a life preserver.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (cooing baby-cat talk)
                    Come here Jonesy you ugly old
                    moose...you ugly thing.

        Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
        seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits
        beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him.  He is
        thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
        or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A
        smile referred to as "winning."

                                   MAN
                    Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
                    I work for the company, but other
                    than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
                    see you're feeling better.  I'm told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon.  Side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep, or
                    something like that.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long was I out there?  They
                    won't tell me anything.

                                   BURKE
                           (soothing)
                    Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
                    about that just yet.

        Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long?

        Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.

                                   BURKE
                    All right.  My instinct says
                    you're strong enough to handle
                    this...Fifty-seven years.

        Ripley is stunned.  She seems to deflate, her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost.  Friends.  Family.  Her world.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

                                   BURKE
                    You'd drifted right through the
                    core systems.  It's blind luck that
                    deep-salvage team caught you when
                    they...are you all right?

        Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror.  Burke hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand.  She slaps it away.  It
        shatters with a SMASH.  Jones dives, yowling.  Ripley
        grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.
        The Med-Tech hits a console button.

                                   MED-TECH
                           (shouting)
                    Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
                    4-1-5!

        Burke and the Med-Tech are holding Ripley's shoulders as
        she goes into convulsions.  A DOCTOR and TWO TECHS run
        in.  Ripley's back arches in agony.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No...noooo!

        They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
        equipment.  Her EKG races like mad.  Jones, under a
        cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.

                                   DOCTOR
                    Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
                    And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!

        AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
        chest!  Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
        SHEET.  Tearing itself out of her.

        HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises.  A GLIMPSE OF the
        CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
        Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
        breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
        snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.

        A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on.  A MED-TECH's
        face.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Bad dreams again?  Do you want
                    something to help you sleep?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (faint)
                    No.. I've slept enough.

        The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off.  Touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
        Gateway and the turquoise Earth.  She hugs Jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
        nightmare.  Shivering.  Sleep is far off.

                                   RIPLEY
                    We made it, Jones.  We made it.

        But at what price?

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. PARK                                                 4   

        Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars,
        beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE.

        EXTREME F.G.  Jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
        fallen leaves.  He leaps.  And smack into A WALL.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (voice over)
                    Dumbshit.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Jones steps back confused from the
        HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
        cinerama video-loop.  Ripley sits on a bench in what we
        now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
        somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station.  Benches.
        Some unenthusiastic potted trees.  The sterile corridors
        VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.

        Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.

                                   BURKE
                    Sorry...I've been running behind
                    all morning.

        Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Have they located my daughter
                    yet?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, I was going to wait
                    until after the inquest...

        He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
        hard copy, including a telestat photo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Is she...?

                                   BURKE
                           (scanning)
                    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
                    name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
                    ...at time of death.  Two years
                    ago.
                           (looks at her)
                    I'm sorry.

        Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.

        The face of a woman in her mid-sixties.  It could be
        anybody.  She tries to reconcile the face with the
        little girl she once knew.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Amy.

                                   BURKE
                           (reading)
                    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
                    licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
                    Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
                    Wisconsin.  No children.

        Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
        past.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I promised her I'd be home for
                    her birthday.  Her eleventh
                    birthday.  I sure missed that
                    one.
                           (pause)
                    Well...she has already learned
                    to take my promises with a grain
                    of salt.  When it came to flight
                    schedules, anyway.

        Burke nods, a simpatico presence.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You always think you can make it
                    up to somebody...later, you know.
                    But now I never can.  I never
                    can.

        Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough
        lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
        this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently.

        Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.

                                   BURKE
                           (gently)
                   The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
                   don't want to be late.

        INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY                                   5

        Elevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation
        with Burke.  DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You read my deposition...it's
                    complete and accurate.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, I believe you, but there are
                    going to be some heavyweights in
                    there.  You got Feds, you got
                    interstellar commerce commission,
                    you got colonial administration,
                    insurance company guys...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I get the picture.

                                   BURKE
                    Just tell them what happened.  The
                    important thing is to stay cool
                    and unemotional.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY                6

        She's not cool.  Not unemotional.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Do you people have earwax, of
                    what?  We have been here three
                    hours.  How many different ways
                    do you want me to tell the same
                    story?

        She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a
        long conference table.  Gray suits and grim faces.  They
        aren't buying.  Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN,
        PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot.  His
        file prints out next to it.  BRETT's face and dossier
        replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues...
        KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS.
        VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers
        and frowns.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Look at it from our perspective.
                    You freely admit to detonating the
                    engines of, and thereby destroying,
                    an M-Class star-freighter.  A
                    rather expensive piece of hardware...

                                   INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR 
                           (dryly)
                    Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
                    That's minus payload, of course.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The shuttle's flight recorder
                    corroborates some elements of
                    your account.  That the Nostromo
                    set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
                    planet, at that time.  That
                    repairs were made.  That it resumed
                    its course and was subsequently set
                    for self-destruct.  By you.  For
                    reasons unknown.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I told you...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It did not, however, contain any
                    entries concerning the hostile
                    life form you allegedly picked up.

        Ripley sense the noose tightening.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Then somebody's gotten to it...
                    doctored the recorder.  Who had
                    access to it?

        The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
        Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.

                                   ECA REP
                    Would you just listen to yourself
                    for one minute.

        Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous
        side of fifty.  Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The analysis team which went over
                    your shuttle centimeter by
                    centimeter found no physical
                    evidence of the creature you
                    describe...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (losing it) 
                    That's because I blew it out the
                    Goddamn airlock!
                           (pause)
                    Like I said.

                                   INSURANCE MAN
                           (to ECA Rep)
                    Are there any species like this
                    'hostile organism' on LV-426?

                                   ECA REP
                    No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
                    life larger than a simple virus.

        Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
                    There was an alien spacecraft there.
                    A derelict ship.  We homed on its
                    beacon...

                                   ECA REP
                    To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
                    over three hundred worlds and no one's
                    ever reported a creature which, using
                    your words...
                           (read from Ripley's
                           statement)
                    ...'gestates in a living human host'
                    and has 'concentrated molecular acid
                    for blood.'

        Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
        table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as
        a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I can see where this is
                    going.  But I'm telling you those
                    things exist.  Back on that planetoid
                    is an alien ship and on that ship
                    are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
                    Do you understand?  I suggest you
                    find it, using the flight recorder's
                    data.  Find it and deal with it --
                    before one of your survey teams
                    comes back with a little surprise...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
                    will be...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (louder, stepping
                           on him)
                    ...because just one of those
                    things managed to kill my entire
                    crew, within twelve hours of
                    hatching...

        Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, that will be all.

        Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
                    those things get back here, that
                    will be all.  Then you can just
                    kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
                    it goodbye.

        Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration
        and anger.  Dallas looks back at her from the video
        screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             7

        Ripley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee
        and donuts at a vending machine.

                                   BURKE
                    You had them eating out of your
                    hand, kiddo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    They had their minds made up
                    before I even went in there.
                    They think I'm a head case.

                                   BURKE
                           (cheerfully)
                    You are a head case.  Have a donut.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - LATER            8

        Van Leuwen clears his throat.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It is the finding of this board of
                    inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,
                    NOC-14672. has acted with questionable
                    judgment and is unfit to hold an
                    ICC license as a commercial flight
                    officer.

        Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lipped
        but subdued.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Said license is hereby suspended
                    indefinitely.  No criminal charges
                    will be filed at this time and you
                    are released on own recognizance
                    for a six month period of
                    psychometric probation, to include
                    monthly review by an ICC psychiatric
                    tech...

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             9

        DOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and
        Ripley strides through.  She shrugs off Burke's
        restraining arm and catches up to Van Leuwen walking
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (insistent)
                    Why won't you check out LV-426?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                           (condescendingly)
                    Because I don't have to.  The
                    people who live there checked it
                    out years ago and they never
                    reported and 'hostile organism'
                    or alien ship.  And by the way,
                    they call it Acheron now.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What are you talking about.
                    What people?

        Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but
        Ripley holds the door from closing.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Terraformers...planet engineers.
                    It's what we call a shake 'n' bake
                    colony.  They set up atmosphere
                    processors to make the air
                    breathable...big job.  Takes
                    decades.  They've already been
                    there over twenty years.  Peacefully.

        The door tries to close.  Ripley slams it back.  People
        are getting annoyed.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How many colonists?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Sixty, maybe seventy families.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Sweet Jesus.

                                   ELEVATOR PASSENGER
                    Do you mind?

        Ripley's hand slides off the door, strengthless.

        TIGHT ON HER  FROM INSIDE the elevator as the doors close
        like fate on her lost expression.

        EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY                               10

        A hideous, storm-blasted vista.  Tortured rock forms.
        Bleak twilight at midday.

        PAN SLOWLY ONTO a CORRODED METAL SIGN set in concrete
        pylons, which reads:

                       HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159
                         "WELCOME TO ACHERON"

        Some local has added below in spray-can graffiti
        "Have a nice day."  Gale-force wind SCREECHES around
        the steel sign, driving a freezing rain.

        The COLONY, b.g., is a squat complex with lots of
        floodlights.

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      11

        The town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete
        buildings connected by conduits.  Neon signs throw garish
        colors across the vaultlike walls, advertising bars and
        other businesses.  It looks like a sodden cross between
        the Krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in
        the Nevada boondocks.

        Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted
        "street" and vanish down rampways to underground garages.

        ANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK  the largest structure.  It
        resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft
        carrier...a flying bridge.

        VISIBLE across a half kilometer of barren heath, b.g.,
        is the massive complex of the nearest ATMOSPHERE
        PROCESSOR, looking like a power plant bred with an active
        volcano.  Its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover
        like a steel mill.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK                 12

        A central space, laid out like a scaled-down shopping
        mall with no styling flourishes.  We SEE a cross section
        of the types of people who have come to live on
        Godforsaken Acheron.  Tough.  Pragmatic.  "Grapes of
        Wrath" faces.  Calloused hands.  Not too many interior
        decorators.  Some children race in the corridor on things
        that look suspiciously like "Big Wheels."

        INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK                     13

        Jammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays...
        most of the business of running the colony flows through
        here.  It's high tech but used and scrungy.  Papers
        piled up.  Coffee cup rings.

        DOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, the Assistant Operations Manager,
        as he catches up to the harried Operating Manager,
        SIMPSON.

                                   LYDECKER
                    You remember you sent some
                    wildcatters out to that
                    plateau, out past the Ilium
                    range, a couple days ago?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Yeah.  What?

                                   LYDECKER
                    There's a guy on the horn,
                    mom-and-pop survey team.  Says
                    he's homing on something and
                    wants to know if his claim will
                    be honored.

                                   SIMPSON
                    Christ.  Some honch in a cushy
                    office on Earth says go look at
                    a grid reference in the middle
                    of nowhere, we look.  They don't
                    say why, and I don't ask.  I
                    don't ask because it takes two
                    weeks to get an answer out here
                    and the answer's always 'don't
                    ask.'

                                   LYDECKER
                    So what do I tell this guy?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
                    he finds something it's his.

        EXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED     14
        TRACTOR - DAY

        It roars across corrugated rock, blasting through soggy
        drifts of volcanic ash.

        INT. TRACTOR                                             15

        At the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN,
        independent prospector.  Beside him is his wife/partner
        ANNE and in the back their two kids are playing among the
        heavy sampling equipment.

                                   JORDEN
                           (gloating cackle)
                    Look at this fat, juicy magnetic
                    profile.  And it's mine, mine,
                    mine.

                                   ANNE
                    Half mine, dear.

        NEWT, their six-year-old daughter, yells from the back...

                                   NEWT
                    And half mine!

                                   JORDEN
                    I got too many partners.

                                   NEWT
                    Daddy, when are we going back
                    to town?

                                   JORDEN
                    When we get rich, Newt.

                                   NEWT
                    You always say that.  I wanna go
                    back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'

        Her older brother TIM sticks his jeering face close to
        hers.

                                   TIM
                    You cheat too much.

                                   NEWT
                    Do not.  I'm just the best.

                                   TIM
                    Do too!  You go in places we
                    can't fit.

                                   NEWT
                    So!  That's why I'm the best.

                                   ANNE
                    Knock it off!  I catch either of
                    you playing in the air ducts again
                    I'll tan your hides.

                                   NEWT
                    Mom.  All the kids play it...

                                   JORDEN
                           (reverently)
                    Holy shiiit!

        ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY  ON a bizarre shape looming
        ahead.  An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from
        the bed of ash.  The tractor slows.

        Canted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping
        by the lava flow, it is still recognizable as an
        EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP.  Bio-mechanoid.  Nonhuman design.

                                   JORDEN
                    Folks, we have scored big this
                    time.

        EXT. TRACTOR                                             16

        Jorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS.
        Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR.  Their
        breath clouds in the chill air.

                                   ANNE
                    You kids stay inside.  I mean
                    it!  We'll be right back.

        They trudge toward the alien derelict.

                                   ANNE
                    Shouldn't we call in?

                                   JORDEN
                    Let's wait till we know what to
                    call it in as.

                                   ANNE
                           (nervous)
                    How about 'big weird thing'?

        They pause at a twisted gash in the hull.  Blackness
        inside.

        INT./EXT. TRACTOR                                        17

        Newt has her face pressed to the glass, steaming it.
        Watching her parents enter the strange ship.  Tim GRABS
        HER from behind.  She SHRIEKS.

                                   TIM
                    Cheater!

        EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   18

        The tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless.
        The wind HOWLS around them.

        Tim is curled up in the driver's seat.  Newt shakes him
        awake, trying hard not to cry.

                                   NEWT
                    Timmy...they've been gone a
                    long time.

        Tim considers the night.  The wind.  The vast landscape.
        He bites his lip.

                                   TIM
                           (quavering)
                    It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows
                    what he's doing.

        CRASH!  Newt SCREAMS as the door beside her is RIPPED
        OPEN.  A dark shape lunges inside!

        Anne, panting and terrified, grabs the dash mike.

                                   ANNE
                    Mayday!  Mayday!  This is
                    Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
                    calling Hadley Control.
                    Repeat.  This is...

        As Anne shouts the mayday Newt looks past her, to the
        ground.  Russ Jorden lies there inert, dragged somehow
        by Anne from inside the ship.  There is SOMETHING ON
        HIS FACE.  An appalling MULTILEGGED CREATURE, pulsing
        with obscene life.  Newt begins to SCREAM hysterically,
        competing with the shrieking wind which rises to a
        crescendo as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY                  20

        Silence.  Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in
        the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from
        her cigarette.  The place is modest, to be charitable,
        and there are few personal touches.  Though it's late
        in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe.  The bed is
        unmade.  Dishes in the sink.  Jones prowls across the
        counter.  The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly.

                                   VOICE FROM VIDEO
                           (o.s.)
                    Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the
                    family are heading off for the
                    colonies!

                                   BON
                           (o.s.)
                    Best decision I ever made, Bill.
                    We'll be starting a new life
                    from scratch, in a clean world.
                    No crime.  No unemployment...

        The door BUZZES.  Ripley jumps like a cat.  Jones doesn't.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            21

        Carter Burke stands in the narrow, dingy corridor with
        LIEUTENANT GORMAN, Colonial Marine Corps.  Young and
        severe in his officer's dress-black.  The door opens
        slightly.

                                   BURKE
                    Hi, Ripley.  This is
                    Lieutenant Gorman of the...

        SLAM.  Burke buzzes again.  Talks to the door...

                                   BURKE
                    Ripley we have to talk.
                           (pause) 
                    They've lost contact with the
                    colony on Acheron.

        The door opens.  Ripley considers the ramifications of
        that.  She motions them inside.

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER                 22

        Burke and Gorman are seated, nursing coffee.  Ripley
        paces, very tense.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No.  There's no way!

                                   BURKE
                    Hear me out...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I was reamed, steamed and
                    dry-cleaned by you guys...and
                    now you want me to go back out
                    there?  Forget it.

        We SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger.
        Burke sees it.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, we don't know what's going
                    on out there.  It may just be a
                    down transmitter.  But if it's
                    not, I want you there...as an
                    advisor.  That's all.

                                   GORMAN
                    You wouldn't be going in with the
                    troops.  I can guarantee your
                    safety.

                                   BURKE
                    These Colonial Marines are
                    some tough hombres, and they're
                    packing state-of-the-art firepower.
                    Nothing they can't handle...right,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                           (cool)
                    We're trained to deal with these
                    kinds of situations.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (to Burke)
                    What about you?  What's your
                    interest in this?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, the corporation co-financed
                    that colony with the Colonial
                    Administration, against mineral
                    rights.  We're getting into a lot
                    of terraforming...'Building Better
                    Worlds.'

        Burke is revealing his early days in sales.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

                                   BURKE
                    I heard you were working in the
                    cargo docks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (defensive)
                    That's right.

                                   BURKE
                    Running loaders, forklifts, that
                    sort of thing?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shrugging)
                    It's all I could get.  Anyway,
                    it keeps my mind off of...
                    everything.  Days off are worse.

                                   BURKE
                    What if I said I could get you
                    reinstated as a flight officer?
                    And that the company has agreed
                    to pick up your contract?

                                   RIPLEY
                    If I go.

                                   BURKE
                    If you go.
                           (pause)
                    It's a second chance, kiddo.  And
                    it'll be the best thing in the
                    world for you to face this fear
                    and beat it.  You gotta get back
                    on the horse...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (frosty)
                    Spare me, Burke.  I've had my
                    psych evaluation this month.

        Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.

                                   BURKE
                    Yes, and I've read it.  You
                    wake up every night, sheets
                    soaking, the same nightmare
                    over and over...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    No!  The answer is no.  Now
                    please go.  I'm sorry.  Just
                    go, would you.

        Burke nods to Gorman who rises with him.  He slips a
        TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door.

                                   BURKE
                    Think about it.

        EXT. ACHERON LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                           23

        As the wind HOWLS through tormented rock, BUILDING IN
        PITCH until we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. APARTMENT                                           24

        Ripley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry.  She
        clutches her chest, breathing hard.  Bathed in sweat
        she lights a cigarette with trembling hands.  Do we
        hear a faint, desolate wind?

        TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE  as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's
        card into a slot.  "STAND BY" prints out on the screen
        and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep.

                                   BURKE
                           (on video phone)
                    Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

                                   RIPLEY
                    Burke, just tell me one thing.
                    That you're going out there to
                    kill them.  Not study.  Not bring
                    back.  Just burn them out...clean
                    ...forever.

                                   BURKE
                    That's the plan.  My word on it.

        CLOSEUP - RIPLEY  taking a deep slow breath.  It's time
        to look the demon in the eye.

                                   RIPLEY
                    All right.  I'm in.

        She punches off before Burke replies, before she can
        change her mind.  She turns to Jones sitting on the
        bed and her tone becomes admonishing...

                                   RIPLEY
                    And you my dear, are staying
                    right here.

        Jones blinks, cynical cat eyes..."count me right
        out."

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER                      25

        An empty starfield.  Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME.

        A mountain of steel following.  A massive military
        transport ship, the SULACO.  Ugly, battered...
        functional.

        INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK                              26

        An empty corridor, seemingly miles long.  No movement.
        The THRUMMING of hyperdrive engines.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                          27

        An enormous chamber, cavernous and dark.  Squatting
        in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface shuttles.
        DROP-SHIPS.  Heavy machinery all around them...
        cranes, loading equipment.

        INT. BRIDGE                                              28

        Dark electronic womb.  CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY among
        murmuring instrumentation.  A sudden high-pitched
        TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights.  An alarm.

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    29

        Blackness, until a bank of indicators lights up.
        Hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of
        horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS.  It reaches the
        ceiling.  Locks.

        CLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE  as trickles of water run
        down the frosted canopy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    30

        Lit up, white and sterile.

        The canopies of the row of capsules are raised.  Ripley
        sits up.  Rubs her arms briskly.  Next to her Gorman
        and Burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers,
        wearing shorts and dog tags.  They are:

           MASTER SERGEANT APONE                    UNIT LEADER

           CORPORAL HICKS                         B-TEAM LEADER

           CORPORAL DIETRICH (female)                  MED-TECH

           PFC HUDSON                                  COM-TECH 
           
           PFC VASQUEZ (female)            'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE DRAKE                   'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE FROST                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE CROWE                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE WIERZBOWSKI                          TROOPER

           CORPORAL FERRO (female)              DROP-SHIP PILOT

           PFC SPUNKMEYER                   DROP-SHIP CREW CHIEF

        The ship is fully automated in interstellar flight so
        there is no crew, except for EXECUTIVE OFFICER (ECA) Bishop,
        who supervises planetary maneuvering.

        GROANS echo across the chamber.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for
                    this shit.

        SPUNKMEYER says this sincerely, though he must have
        enlisted underage not long ago.  Looking surly, DRAKE
        sits up.  He's young as well but street-tough.  Nasty
        scar curling his lip into a sneer.

                                   DRAKE
                    They ain't payin' us enough
                    for this.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Not enough to have to wake up
                    to your face, Drake.

                                   DRAKE
                    Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look
                    like I feel.

        HICKS, an older lifer-type who keeps his own counsel,
        just snorts good-naturedly.

        Ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a
        bank of lockers.  Though not supermen they are lean and
        hardened...tough, capable, jaded.  They combine the
        specialized techno-combat training of the twenty-first
        century fighting man with those qualities universal to
        "grunts" through the ages.  SERGEANT APONE moves down the
        row of freezers.

                                   HUDSON
                    This floor's freezing.

                                   APONE
                    Christ.  I never saw such a
                    buncha old women.  You want me
                    to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    Would you, Sir?

        Ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding
        cursory hellos.  She feels isolated by the camaraderie
        of this tightknit group.

        VASQUEZ eyes her coldly as she passes.  Like Drake,
        Vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat-primer
        was the street in a Los Angeles barrio.  She is tough
        even by the standards of this group.  Hard-muscled.
        Eyes cunning and mean.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, Vasquez...you ever been
                    mistaken for a man?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    No.  Have you?

        She slaps Drake's open palm and it clenches into a
        greeting which is part contest.  It gets rougher.
        Painful.  Until she cuffs him hard and they break with
        vicious laughter.  Dobermans playing.  Conscripted from
        juvenile prison, the two of them were trained to
        operate the formidable "SMART-GUNS."  That is part
        of their bond.

        BISHOP is helping everyone like a valet.  As he passes
        close to her Ripley notices a strange TATTOO across
        the back of his left hand...an ALPHA-NUMERIC CODE.

                                   FROST
                    Hey, hand job, you take my
                    towel?

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                           (overlapping)
                    I need some slack, man.  How
                    come they send us straight back
                    out like this?  We got some slack
                    comin', man.

                                   HICKS
                    You just got three weeks.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    I mean breathing, not this frozen
                    shit.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?

                                   APONE
                    You know it ain't up to me.
                           (louder)
                    Awright!  Let's knock off the
                    grabass.  First assembly's in
                    fifteen...let's shag it.

        INT. SHOWERS                                             31

        High pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when
        you step out...a drive through car wash for people.
        Through the swirling steam Hudson, Vasquez and FERRO
        are watching Ripley dry off.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Who's the fresh meat again?

                                   FERRO
                    She's supposed to be some kinda
                    consultant...
                    (exaggerated)
                    ...She was an alien once.

                                   HUDSON
                    Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

                                   APONE
                    Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!

        INT. MESS HALL                                           32

        An unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers
        assemble at one long table while Gorman, Burke, Bishop
        and Ripley sit at another.  Everybody is nursing a
        coffee, waiting for eggs from the AUTOCHEF.  Among the
        troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized
        and emblazoned with patches.  Drake's tunic is cut off
        to a vest and has "Eat the apple and fuck the Corps"
        stenciled on back.  "Peace Through Superior Firepower,"
        "Pray for War" and "I've Served My Time in Hell:  Cetti
        Epsilon NC-104" are some others.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?

                                   APONE
                    Rescue mission.  There's some
                    juicy colonists' daughters we
                    gotta rescue from virginity.

        Apone is stocky, grizzled, with peregrine eyes.  He runs
        it loose and fair, but only because he knows his people
        are the best.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists.
                    What's this crap supposed to be?

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't
                    mind getting me some more a
                    that Arcturan poontang.  Remember
                    that time?

                                   HICKS
                           (low)
                    Looks like that new Lieutenant's
                    too good to eat with us grunts.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                           (glancing
                           over shoulder)
                    Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass,
                    definitely.

        Across the room, at the other table, Gorman sits with
        his creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO.  Bishop
        takes a seat beside Ripley, who pointedly gets up and
        moves to the far side of the table.  He looks wounded.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm sorry you feel that way
                    about Synthetics, Ripley.

        Ripley spins on Burke, her tone accusing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You never said anything about an
                    android being here!  Why not?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's
                    been policy for years to have a
                    synthetic on board.

                                   BISHOP
                    I prefer the term 'artificial person'
                    myself.  Is there a problem?

                                   BURKE
                    A synthetic malfunctioned on her
                    last trip out.  Some deaths were
                    involved.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?

                                   BURKE
                    Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.

        Bishop turns to Ripley, very conciliatory.

                                   BISHOP
                    Well, that explains it.  The
                    A/2's were always a bit twitchy.
                    That could never happen now with
                    out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible
                    for me to harm or, by omission of
                    action, allow to be harmed a
                    human being.
                           (smiling)
                    More cornbread?

        WHAM!  Ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway
        across the room.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Just stay away from me, Bishop!
                    You got that straight?

        Burke and Gorman exchange glances.

        Wierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back
        to the other troopers.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    She don't like the cornbread
                    either.

        INT. READY ROOM - TIGHT ON APONE - ARMORY                33

                    Tench-hut!

        WIDER ANGLE  as the troops snap to from their lounging
        among the racks of high-tech weaponry.  Gorman enters
        with Burke and Ripley.

                                   GORMAN
                    At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't
                    have time to brief before we
                    left Gateway but...

                                   HUDSON
                    Sir?

                                   GORMAN
                           (annoyed)
                    Yes, Hicks?

                                   HUDSON
                    Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.

                                   GORMAN
                    What's the question?

                                   HUDSON
                    Is this going to be a stand-up
                    fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

                                   GORMAN
                    All we know is that there's
                    still no contact with the colony
                    and that a xenomorph may be
                    involved.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    A what?

                                   HICKS
                           (to Wierzbowski;
                           low)
                    It's a bug-hunt.
                           (louder)
                    So what are these things?

        Gorman nods to Ripley, who stands before the troops.
        She sets some RECORDING DISKETTES on the table.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I've dictated what I know on
                    these.

                                   APONE
                    Tease us a bit.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Yeah...previews.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Okay.  It's important to understand
                    this organism's life cycle.  It's
                    actually two creatures.  The first
                    form hatches from a spore...a sort
                    of large egg, and attaches itself
                    to its victim.  Then it injects
                    an embryo, detaches and dies.
                    It's essentially a walking sex organ.
                    The --

                                   HUDSON
                    Sounds like you, Hicks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (controlled)
                    The embryo, the second form, hosts
                    in the victim's body for several
                    hours.  Gestating.  Then it...
                           (with difficulty)
                    ...then it...emerges.  Moults.
                    Grows rapidly --

                                   VASQUEZ
                    I only need to know one thing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yes?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Where they are.

        Vasquez coolly points her finger, cocks her thumbs, and
        blows away an imaginary alien.

                                   DRAKE
                    Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   HUDSON
                    Somebody said alien...she
                    thought they said illegal alien
                    and signed up.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Fuck you.

                                   HUDSON
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (icy)
                    Am I disturbing you conversation
                    Mr. Hudson?

        Hudson settles down, smirking.  Ripley locks eyes with
        Vasquez.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I hope you're right.  I really
                    do.

                                   BURKE
                           (to all)
                    I suggest you study the disks
                    Ripley has been kind enough to
                    prepare for you.

                                   GORMAN
                    Are there any questions?  Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    How do I get out of this
                    chicken-shit outfit?

        Gorman scowls then, thanking Ripley with a nod, takes
        over the predrop briefing.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right.  I want this to go
                    smooth and by the numbers.  I
                    want DCS and tactical database
                    assimilation by 0830.
                            (some groans)
                    Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
                    drop-ship prep details will have

        ...Pearlescent cloud cover masking the environmental

        lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms.

        Spunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the
        ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where
        it locks into place.  As he exerts pressure with his
        hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms
        move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase
        in power.  The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can
        crush with tons of pressure.  The loader has an open
        ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported
        by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly
        with the driver's movements.

        You have never seen anything like this before.
        Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift
        to them...battered and well used.  Covered with grease.
        Repainted many times.  Across the back is stencilled
        "CATERPILLAR."

        Spunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop-ship
        and we become aware of the intense activity throughout
        the cavernous loading bay.  Troopers on foot or driving
        TOW-MOWERS, OVERHEAD LOADING ARMS...all in motion.
        Hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 37

        Wierzbowski, Drake and Vasquez are fieldstripping
        light weapons with precise movements.  Around them,
        in racks, is an arsenal of advanced personal
        artillery.

        Vasquez likes the feel of the guns, the weight...the
        authority.  Her hands move without hesitation.  CLACK.
        CLACK.  CLACK.  She swings one of the SMART-GUNS out
        on a work stand.  Using a body brace and GYRO-STABILIZED
        SUPPORT ARM, it is a computer-aimed, video targeted
        automatic weapon.  The futuristic equivalent of a .30
        caliber light machine gun.  Sort of a steadicam that
        kills.

        INT. LOADING BAY - ANGLE ON BURKE AND GORMAN             38

        with pre-flight activity b.g.

                                   BURKE
                    Still nothing from the colony?

                                   GORMAN
                    Dead on all channels.

        Ripley watches the drop-ship being loaded.  A cross
        between a Huey Aircobra gunship and the space shuttle
        might describe it.  An orbit-to-surface troop carrier,
        heavily armed for the close support of ground missions.
        She watches a six-wheeled APC, ARMORED PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, being raised hydraulically into the ship's
        belly.  Ripley looks around as Frost wheels a rack of
        incomprehensible equipment toward her.

                                   FROST
                    Clear, please.

        Ripley jumps aside, nodding apologetically.  She turns.
        Steps hastily back.  Hudson cruises by with a laden
        forklift.

                                   HUDSON
                    Excuse me.

        ANGLE ON APONE  standing with Hicks, as Ripley approaches
        him

                                   RIPLEY
                    I feel like a fifth wheel
                    here.  Is there anything I can
                    do?

                                   APONE
                    I don't know.  Is there anything
                    you can do?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (pointing)
                    I can drive that loader.  I've
                    got a Class Two rating.  My
                    latest career move.

        Apone turns.  A SECOND POWER LOADER sits unused in
        an equipment bay.

        TWO SHOT APONE AND HICKS  skeptical.  Considering.

        TIGHT ON POWER SWITCH  as Ripley's finger punches it on.
        A RISING WHINE of power.

        TIGHT ON THE HYDRAULICS  as the massive machine stirs
        to life.

        FULL, as the loader starts.  Ripley is strapped into
        the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the
        servo-sensor assemblies.  She takes a step.  BOOM!
        Two tons of hardened steel takes a step.

        Ripley spins the wrist servos.  The huge claws swing,
        open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a
        cargo module, nearby.  She raises it deftly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Where you want it?

        Hicks looks at Apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 39

        The troopers are suiting up for the drop.  Strapping on
        their bulky COMBAT-ARMOR...interlocking plates like
        football padding.  They tape their wrists.  Draw on
        segmented boots.  The sole cleats CLACK like hooves
        on the deck plates.  Lockers SLAM.

        WEB BELTS.  PACKS.  HARNESSES.  HELMETS.  COM-SETS.
        Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings.
        It has its own rhythm...CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.

                                   APONE
                    Let's move it, girls!  On
                    the ready line.  Let's go,
                    let's go.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     40

        Ripley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into
        the ship with the hulking troopers.  Inside they pass
        directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take
        seats facing each other across a narrow aisle.  They will
        drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for
        rapid deployment.  A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling
        depressurization of the cargo lock.

        Hudson prowls the aisle, his movements predatory and
        exaggerated.  Ripley watches him working his way toward
        her.

                                   HUDSON
                    I am ready, man.  Ready to get
                    it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the
                    ultimate badass...state of the
                    badass art.  You do not want to
                    fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't
                    worry.  Me and my squad of
                    ultimate badasses will protect you.
                    Check-it-out...

        He slaps the SERVO-CANNON controls in the GUN BAY
        above them.

                                   HUDSON
                    Independently targetting
                    particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP!
                    Fry half a city with this puppy.
                    We got tactical smart-missles,
                    phased-plasma pulse-rifles,
                    RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic
                    ballbreakers, we got nukes, we
                    got knives...sharp sticks --

        Hicks grabs Hudson by his battle harness and pulls him
        into a seat.  His voice is low, but it carries.

                                   HICKS
                    Save it.

                                   HUDSON
                    Sure, Hicks.

        Ripley nods her thanks to Hicks.  MOTORS WHINE and the
        craft lurches.  Burke, next to Ripley, grins eagerly
        like this is a sport fishing trip.

                                   BURKE
                    Here we go.

        She looks like she's in a gas chamber waiting for the
        pellet to drop.

        EXT. SULACO                                              41

        The drop-ship lowers from the cargo-lock on a massive
        launch rig.  The night side of Acheron yawns below...
        enigmatic.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             42

        Ferro and Spunkmeyer run rapidly through the switches.

                    Initiate release sequencer on my

        EXT. SULACO - DROP-SHIP                                  43

        Hydraulic WHINE.  Clamps SLAM BACK.  The ship drops.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     44

        Apone, stalking the aisle, snatches for a handhold.
        Bishop, Burke and Gorman groan at the sudden gees.
        Ripley closes her eyes...the point of no return.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           45

        It screams down through the stratosphere, plunging
        into dark turbulence.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             46

        Beyond the canopy is gray limbo.  The craft shudders
        and lurches.

                                   FERRO
                           (icy calm)
                    Switching to DCS ranging.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile.
                    Picking up some hull ionization.

                                   FERRO
                    Got it.  Rough air ahead.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          47

        TIGHT ON HICKS  asleep in his harness.

                                   FERRO
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Stand by for some chop.

        TIGHT ON GORMAN  as the ship begins to buck, his eyes
        closed.  Pale.  Sweating.  He rubs his hands on his
        knees repeatedly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How may drops is this for you,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                    Thirty-eight...simulated.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    How many combat drops?

                                   GORMAN
                    Well...two.  Three, including
                    this one.

        Vasquez and Drake exchange do-you-believe-this-shit
        expressions.  Ripley looks accusingly at Burke.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             48

                                   FERRO
                    Turning on final.  Coming around to
                    a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal
                    guidance locked in.  Where's
                    the damn beacon?

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           49

        It emerges from the low cloud ceiling.  From the twilight
        haze ahead the distant colony LANDING BEACONS become
        visible.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          50

        Stumbling as the ship pitches, Ripley makes her way
        forward to the MOBILE TACTICAL OPERATIONS BAY (MTOB),
        a control console lined with monitor screens.  She
        joins Burke watching over Gorman's shoulder as the
        Lieutenant plays the board like a video director.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR CONSOLE  REVEALING screens labelled with
        the names of the troopers.  Two for each soldier.  The
        upper screens show images from the IMAGE-INTENSIFIED
        VIDEO CAMERAS in their helmets.  The lower screens are
        BIO-MONITORS:  EEG, EKG, and other graphic life-function
        readouts.  Other screens show EXTERIOR VIEWS.

                                   GORMAN
                    Let's see.  Everybody on line.
                    Drake, check you camera.  There
                    seems to be a...

        CLOSE ON DRAKE  as he whacks himself on the head with
        an ammo case.  A familiar malfunction.

                                   GORMAN
                           (o.s)
                    ...that's better.  Pan it around
                    a bit.

                                   APONE
                    Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up.
                    Let's move.  Two minutes.
                    Somebody wake up Hicks.

        A clatter of activity as they don backpacks and weapons.
        Vasquez and Drake buckle on their smart-gun body
        harnesses.

        Ripley watches the AP station loom on the exterior
        screens.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That the atmosphere processor?

                                   BURKE
                    Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so,
                    all over the planet.  They're
                    completely automated.  We
                    manufacture them, by the way.

        EXT. SHIP - AP STATION                                   51

        The tiny ship circles the roaring tower.  A metal
        volcano thundering like the engines on God's Lear jet.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          52

        Gorman plays with the controls, zooming the image of
        the colony.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Hold at forty.  Slow circle of
                    the complex.

                                   RIPLEY                                   
                    The structure seems intact.  They
                    have power.

        On the screen the colony buildings loom in and the low
        visibility like wrecks of freighters on the sea floor.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Apone)
                    Okay, let's do it.

                                   APONE
                    Awright!  I want a nice clean
                    dispersal this time.

        Ripley turns as Vasquez squeezes past her.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You staying in here?

                                   RIPLEY
                    You bet.

                                   VASQUEZ
                           (turning away)
                    Figures.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Set down sixty meters this side
                    of the telemetry mast.  Immediate
                    dust off on my 'clear,' then stay
                    on station.

                                   APONE
                    Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      53

        Landing beacons sweep harsh light across the wet Tarmac.
        The ship roars down, extending the loading ramp.  Slams
        down on hydraulic LANDING LEGS.  The APC hits the ground
        a moment later, pulling away from the ship as it leaps
        up in a cloud of spray and peels off, circling.

        The APC pulls to the edge of the complex.  The CREW DOOR
        opens.  Troopers hit the ground running.  Spread out.
        They drop behind immediate cover.  Apone scans with
        him image intensifier visor lowered.

        APONE'S P.O.V.  through the starlight-scope visor.
        Bright as a sunny day, though contrasty and lurid, we
        SEE the colony buildings.  Trash blows in the street.
        No other movement.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    First squad up, on line.  Hicks,
                    get yours in a cordon.  Watch the
                    rear.

                                   APONE
                    Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

        Sprinting in a skirmish line, Apone's team advances on
        the colony main entry-lock.  Parked tightly across the
        doors are two heavy-duty tractors.  Vasquez reaches one
        of the tractors, looks inside.  The controls are ripped
        out, as if by a crowbar or axe.  She moves on.

        EXT. COLONY BUILDING                                     54

        Vasquez reaches the main doors, Drake flanking on the
        right.  Apone tries the door controls.  Nothing.

                                   APONE
                    Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.

        Hudson, all business now, moves up and studies the
        door control panel.  He pries off the facing and starts
        clipping on the bypass wires.

                                   APONE
                    First squad, assemble on me at
                    the main lock.

        The wind roars around the bleak structures.  A neon sign
        creaks overhead.  Hudson makes a connection.  The door
        shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside.  It jams
        partway open.  Apone motions Vasquez inside.  She
        eases over the wrecked tractor, through the doors.
        The others follow.

                                   GORMAN

                    Second team, move up.
                    Flanking positions.

        INT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE                             55

        DOLLYING SLOWLY FORWARD, following Vasquez and Apone as
        they move into the broad corridor.  A few emergency
        lights are still on.  Wind moans along the concourse.
        Pools of water cover the floor.  Farther down, rain drips
        through blast holes in the ceiling.  Evidence of a
        fire fight with pulse-rifles.

        ON VASQUEZ  moving forward.  Taut.  Alert.  Her smart-gun
        cannon swinging slowly in an arc.  She studies the
        video aiming monitor, looking down rather than ahead.
        Their footsteps echo.

        INT. APC                                                 56

        Ripley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty
        colony building.

                                   GORMAN
                    Quarter and search by twos.  Second
                    team move inside.  Hicks, take the
                    upper level.  Use your motion
                    trackers.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - SECOND LEVEL                       57

        Hicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level.
        They emerge cautiously.  An empty corridor recedes into
        the dim distance.  Hicks unslings a rugged piece of
        equipment.  Aims it down the hall.  He adjusts the
        "gain."  It remains silent.

                                   HICKS
                    Nothing.  No movement.

        They pass rooms and offices.  Through doors they see
        increasing signs of struggle.  Furniture overturned.
        Papers scattered...floating sodden in the puddles.

        INT. APC                                                 58

        Ripley et al watching.

                                   BURKE
                    Looks like my room in college.

        Nobody laughs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                        59

        Hicks' group passes several burnt-out rooms.  There are
        no bodies.  In several offices the exterior windows are
        blown out, admitting wind and rain.  Hicks picks up a
        half-eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with
        rainwater.

        INT. LOWER LEVEL - QUARTERS                              60

        Apone's men are searching systematically in pairs.  They
        pass through the colonists' modest apartments, little
        more than cubicles.  Hudson, on tracker, flanks Vasquez
        as they move forward.  Hudson touches a splash of color
        on the wall.  Dried blood.  His tracker BEEPS.

        Vasquez whirls, cannon aimed.  The BEEPING grows more
        frequent as Hudson advances toward a half open door.  The
        door is splintered partway out of its frame.  Holes
        caused by pulse-rifle rounds pepper the walls.  Vasquez
        eases up to the door.  Kicks it in.  Tenses to fire.

        Inside, dangling from a piece of flex conduit, a
        junction-box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a
        broken window.  It clanks against the rails of a child's
        bunkbed as it swings.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     61

        Ripley watches Hicks' monitor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Wait!  Tell him to...
                           (plugs in
                           headset jack)
                    ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left.
                    There!

        TIGHT ON MONITOR  as the image shifts, revealing a
        section of wall corroded almost through in an irregular
        pattern.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  knowing what it is.

                                   HICKS

                   You seeing this okay?  Looks
                   melted.

        Burke raises an eyebrow at Ripley.

                                   BURKE
                    Hmm.  Acid for blood.

                    Looks like somebody bagged them
                    one of Ripley's bad guys here.

        INT. FIRST LEVEL                                         62

        Hudson is looking at something.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, if you like that, you're gonna
                    love this...

        WIDER ANGLE  showing the trooper standing beneath a
        gaping hole.  Another hole, directly beneath, is at his
        feet.  The acid has melted right down through two levels
        into the maintenance level.  Revealing pipes, conduit,
        equipment...eaten away by the ferocious substance.

                                   APONE
                    Second squad?  What's your status?

        Gorman turns to the others.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right, the area's secured.
                    Let's go in and see what their

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      65

        Lights arc across the dormant buildings as the APC turns
        onto the "main drag."  It trundles down the rutted
        street, throwing up sheets of filthy water as the
        massive wheels hit pondlike potholes.  Windblown rain
        lashes across the headlights.

        Hicks emerges from the south lock just as the APC rolls
        up close to the entrance.  The crew-door slides back.
        Gorman emerges, followed by Burke, Bishop, and
        Wierzbowski.  Burke looks back to see Ripley stop in the
        APC doorway, eyeing the ominous colony structure.  She
        meets his eyes.  Shakes her head "no."  Not ready.

                                   HUDSON

                    Okay, stand by in operations.
                           (to those present)
                    Let's go.

        INT. APC                                                 66

        The crew-door cycles home with a clang.  Ripley sits in
        the dark interior, lit by the tactical displays.  The
        wind howls outside, an incredibly desolate sound.  She
        hugs herself.  Alone.  Unarmed.  She knows she's in a
        tank, but remembers the acid.  Leaps up.  Hits the door
        switch.

        EXT. APC - SOUTH LOCK                                    67

        The crew-door opens and Ripley emerges.  In time to see
        the lock doors rumbling closed.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    Burke!

        The wind snatches her words away.  The crew door whines
        shut behind her.  She walks to the exterior lock
        door-controls and studies them.  She punches some
        unfamiliar buttons.  Nothing happens.  She looks really
        nervous, alone in the howling wind.  She hits another
        button.  The door-motors come to life and she relaxes
        a little.  Glances behind her.  AND SCREAMS!  There's
        a face right there!  Right at her shoulder.  She jumps
        back, gasping for breath.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Scare you?

                                   RIPLEY
                    Christ, Wierzbowski!

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an
                    eye on you.

        He gestures for her to precede him inside.

        INT. CONTROL BLOCK CORRIDOR                              68

        Ripley catches up with the others as they move into the
        bowels of the complex.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Burke)
                    Looks like you company can write
                    off its share of this colony.

                                   BURKE
                           (unconcerned)
                    It's insured.

        ON RIPLEY  as they move along the corridor...reacting to
        the fact that she is back in alien country.  She sees
        the ravaged administration complex.  Fire-gutted offices.
        Hicks notices her looking around nervously.  He motions
        to big Wierzbowski with his eyes and the trooper casually
        falls in beside her on the other side, rifle at ready.
        a two-man protective cordon.  She glances at Hicks.  He
        winks, but so fast maybe it's something in his eye.

        Trooper Frost emerges from a side corridor ahead.

                                   FRONT
                    Sir, you should check this out...

        He leads the way into the corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            69

        This wing is completely without power.  The troopers
        switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate
        a scene of devastation worse than they have seen.  Her
        expression reveals that Ripley is about to turn and flee.

                                   FROST
                    Right ahead here...

        They approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a
        hastily welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door
        panels.  Acid holes have slashed through the floor and
        walls in several places.  The metal is scratched and
        twisted by hideously powerful forces, peeled back like
        a soup can on one side.  They squeeze through the
        opening.

        INT. MEDICAL WING                                        70

        They pack-lights play over the devastation of the
        colonists' last ditch battle.  The equipment of the med
        labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier.  The walls
        are perforated by pulse-rifle fire and acid.  Scorched
        by untended fires to bare metal.  A few instruments glow
        with emergency power.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Last stand.

                                   GORMAN
                    No bodies?

                                   FROST
                    No, Sir.  Looks like it was a
                    helluva fight.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  transfixed by something.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Over there.

        The others turn and approach, seeing what she sees.  She
        has entered a second room, part of the med lab area.  In
        a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven
        transparent cylinders.  STASIS TUBES.  They glow faintly
        with an eerie violet light given off by the field which
        preserves the specimens inside.

        They look like jars containing SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS,
        the palsied fingers curled in a death-rictus.
        Structurally they are more like spiders with sickening
        translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill-like
        organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid.
        Something you definitely do not want on your face, for
        example.

                                   BURKE
                    Are these the same...?

        Ripley nods, unable to speak.  Burke leans closer in
        fascination.  His face almost touching one cylinder, is
        lit by its glow.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Watch it, Burke...

        The creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against
        the glass.  Burke jumps back.  From the palm of the
        thing's handlike body emerges a pearl-escent TUBULE.
        like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers
        tonguelike over the inside of the glass.  Then it
        retracts into a sheath between the "gills."

                                   HICKS
                           (to Burke)
                    It likes you.

        Only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life.
        Burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the
        hand-things remain inertly clenched.

                                   BURKE
                    These are dead.  There's just
                    the two alive.

        On top of each cylinder is a file folder.  Ripley takes
        a folder from above one of the live specimens.  Inside
        is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (reading)

                    implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk,

                           (looking up)
                    They killed him getting it off.

                                   HICKS
                    Poor bastard.

        They are startled by a LOUD BEEP.  They turn.  Hicks
        is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the
        shattered barricade.  BEEP.  BEEP.

                                   HICKS
                    Behind us.

        He gestures at the corridor they just passed through.

                                   RIPLEY
                    One of us?

                                   GORMAN
                           (into headset)
                    Apone...where are your people?
                    Anybody in D-Block?

                                   APONE
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Negative.  We're all in Operations.

        Vasquez swings the smart-gun to ready position on
        its support arm, locking it with an authoritative
        CLICK.  She and Hicks head toward the source of the
        signal, the others following.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            71

        Hicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly.  They
        turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth.

        Ripley hangs back.  Then realizes there is nothing
        behind her but darkness.  She catches up to the group.

        INT. KITCHENS                                            72

        The troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the
        stainless steel surfaces.

                                   HICKS
                    It's moving.

        Vasquez is scanning, gaze intense.  The other troops
        grip their weapons tightly.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Which way?

        Hicks nods toward a complicated array of food
        processing equipment.  They move forward, weapons
        leveled.

        Ripley shuffles forward in the dark.  Wierzbowski
        trips over a metal cannister, sending it CLANGING.
        Ripley half climbs the wall.

        Hicks' tracker beeps steadily.  The beeps merge.
        Become a solid tone.  CRASH.  Something moves in the
        dark, toppling a rack of stockpots.

        ON VASQUEZ  pivoting smoothly to fire.  In the same
        instant Hicks' rifle slashes INTO FRAME.  Slams
        Vasquez' barrel upward.  A STREAM OF TRACER FIRE rips
        into the ceiling, the rounds SEARING LIKE LIGHTNING.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You fuck!

        Hicks ignores her, moving past and aiming his light
        under a row of steel cabinets.  He gestures to Ripley,
        who steps forward.  Trusting his judgment.  She
        crouches beside him.

        RIPLEY'S P.O.V.  lit by Hicks' pack-light...a tiny
        cowering figure.  A very dirty, very terrified
        NEWT JORDEN.  She clutches a plastic food packet in
        one hand, its top gnawed partway through.  In the other
        hand she grips the HEAD OF A LARGE DOLL, holding it by
        the hair.  Just the head.  Eyes staring.  Newt is
        pathetically emaciated...fragile-looking as Dresden
        china, her hair tangled and matted.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothingly)
                    Come on out.  It's all right...

        Ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the
        cabinet.  Newt backs away, trembling visibly, her
        vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights.
        Ripley's hand almost reaches her.

        The kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the
        cabinetry.  Ripley scrambles to follow...to keep her
        in sight.  Crabbing frantically sideways.  Hicks makes
        a grab, catching one tiny ankle.  He snaps his hand
        out a moment later.

                                   HICKS
                    Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.

        The girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the
        baseboard, its grille kicked out.  She scrambles
        inside, her tiny body barely fitting, wriggling like
        a fish.

        In his bulky armor Hicks knows he'll never make it
        into the tiny duct.  Ripley dives.  She squirms into
        the duct without thinking.  Just ahead she sees Newt
        enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch.  Ripley
        pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it,
        and crawls in after her.

        Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel
        chamber.  Ripley shines her light around in amazement.
        It is a NEST.  A nest built by a child.  Wadded up
        blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a
        haphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP
        JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even a
        battery operated TAPE PLAYER.  All foraged from the
        wrecked colony.  Ripley marvels at the child's
        incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even
        in this nightmarish environment.

        Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch.

        Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug.  The
        kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets.  Eyes
        wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent.  No
        scream.

                                   RIPLEY
                    It's okay, it's okay.  It's over...
                    you're going to be all right now...
                    it's okay...you're safe...

        Newt goes limp, almost catatonic.

        CLOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE  her lips
        are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and
        she flinches from unseen terrors.  We READ a dark
        nightmare world in her eyes.

        Ripley's light falls on something amidst the debris...
        a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Newt, dressed up and smiling,
        a ribbon in her hair.  In embossed gold letters
        underneath it says:

                      FIRST GRADE CITIZENSHIP AWARD
                              REBECCA JORDEN

        INT. OPERATIONS - ON NEWT - MANAGER'S OFFICE             73

        sitting huddles in a chair, arms around her knees.
        Looking at a point in space.

        WIDER ANGLE  REVEALING Gorman sitting in front of her
        while Dietrich watches the readouts from a
        BIO-MONITORING CUFF wrapped around Newt's tiny arm.

                                   GORMAN
                    Now think, Rebecca.
                    Concentrate.  Just start at
                    the beginning...

        No response.  Ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.

                                   GORMAN
                    Where are your parents?  You
                    have to try...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (sharply)
                    Gorman!  Give it a rest would
                    you.

        Gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.

                                   GORMAN
                    Total brain-lock.

                                   DIETRICH
                           (shrugs)
                    Physically she's okay.
                    Borderline malnutrition, but
                    I don't think any permanent
                    damage.

        She unsnaps the bio-monitoring cuff.

                                   GORMAN
                    Come on, we're wasting our
                    time.

        Gorman and the others exit, leaving only Ripley with
        Newt.  Through the window of the office, out on the
        main floor of the operations room, we SEE Gorman
        join Burke and Bishop at a computer terminal.

        Ripley kneels beside Newt, brushing the girl's unkempt
        hair out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Here, try this.  A little
                    instant hot chocolate.

        She wraps the child's hands around the cup.  Raises
        it to her lips for her.  The girl drinks mechanically,
        spilling down her chin.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothing)
                    Poor thing.  You don't talk
                    much do you?  That's okay by
                    me.  Most people do a lot of
                    talking and they wind up not
                    saying very much.

        She sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Uh oh.  I made a clean spot
                    here.  Now I've done it.  Guess
                    I'll just have to do the whole
                    thing.

        She pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small
        cloth and gently washes the little girl's face.
        Newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Hard to believe...there's a
                    little girl under all this.
                    And a pretty one at that.

        Newt gazes at her.  Ripley smiles.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                          74

        The ground teams are gathered around a terminal in
        the computer center.  Hudson has the CPU main computer
        on-line and reading out.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR SCREEN  as an abstract of the main

        Hudson bashes at the keyboard, his fingers dancing
        expertly.

        INT. OFFICE                                              75

        Ripley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth,
        pink skin emerging from black grime.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I don't know how you managed
                    to stay alive but you're one
                    brave kid, Rebecca.

        Newt's voice is almost inaudible.

                                   NEWT
                    N-newt.

        Ripley leans closer.  Feels like she's breathing
        on coals.  The sound was incomprehensible.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What did you say?

                                   NEWT
                    Newt.  My n-name's Newt.
                    Nobody calls me Rebecca except
                    my dork brother.

        Ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak...
        or break the spell.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, Newt it is then.  My
                   name's Ripley...and people
                   call me Ripley.

        Ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it
        formally.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Pleased to meet you.  And who
                   is this?  Does she have a
                   name?

        Newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched
        in one filthy hand.

                                  NEWT
                   Casey.  She's my only friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about me?

        Newt's reply is flat, neutral.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want you for a friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

                                  NEWT 
                   Because you'll be gone soon,
                   like the others.  Like
                   everybody.  You'll be dead
                   and you'll leave me alone.

        Ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous
        statement and by the situation which could have
        produced this outlook in a child.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad
                   went away like that, didn't
                   they?
        
        Newt nods, staring at her knees.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (soothingly)
                   They'd be here if they could,
                   honey.  I know they would.

                                  NEWT
                          (with cold certainty)
                   They're dead.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I
                   won't leave you.  I promise.

                                  NEWT
                   You promise?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Cross my heart.

                                  NEWT
                   And hope to die?

        Ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre
        expression.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   And hope to die.

        And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even
        the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished
        by a smile and a single promise.

        Newt's eyes brim as she gazes at Ripley.  Her lower
        lip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deforms
        into an abject mask.  She sobs as she clamps her arms
        around Ripley's neck.  The sobs come in waves as
        Ripley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror and
        grief and hurt rolling down her face.  It is a
        breakthrough.

        Ripley closes her eyes, hoping that this promise
        can be kept.

        The APC roars across the stygian landscape, traversing
        the causeway which connects the colony to the
        ATMOSPHERE STATION a kilometer away.  Behind it the
        drop-ship settles to the ground at the colony landing
        field.

        PAN WITH THE APC TO REVEAL the massive structure.
        Like a vast foundry the conical exhaust tower
        flickers with spectral light.

        INT. APC                                                 78

        The troopers sit, more subdued now, swaying and
        bouncing in the heavily sprung vehicle.  Wierzbowski
        is in the saddle.  Ripley and Newt sit side by side
        just aft of the driver's cockpit.

                                  NEWT
                   I was the best at the game.
                   I knew the whole maze.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The 'maze'?  You mean the
                   air ducts?

                                  NEWT
                   Yeah, you know.  In the walls,
                   under the floor.  I was the
                   ace.  I could hide better
                   than anybody.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're really something, ace.

        Ripley's gaze shifts out the windshield as the
        processing station looms ahead.

        EXT. APC/STATION                                         79

        The vast structure towers above the parked personnel
        carrier.  Deploying in front of the APC, backlit by
        its lights, the troopers cast long shadows.  They
        look ominous.  Hulking techno-samurai.

        The base of the station is a depthless maze of
        conduits and pressure vessels, like an oil refinery.
        Or a Dantean version of one.  The THRUM of
        functioning machine systems echoes through the
        labyrinth.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Forty meters in.  Ramp on
                   axial two-two.  Access to
                   sublevels.

        The troopers start down the open rampway.  Light
        filters down through several levels of steel mesh
        floor, catwalks and pipes.  Below that is darkness.

        The thrumming of machines grows louder as they
        descend.

        Huddles around the screens are Ripley, Burke and
        Gorman.  Newt squeezes in from behind.  Gorman is
        doing his video wizard bit, dancing on the buttons.

                                  GORMAN
                          (to team)
                   We're not making that out too
                   well.  What is it?

                   here.

        INT. COMPLEX                                             81

        The group stands before a bizarre tableau.  Among
        the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits
        something new and not of human design had been
        added.

        It is a structure of some sort, extending from and
        crudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but made
        of some strange encrusted substance.  It vaguely
        resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much
        larger scale, and it attenuates so gradually into
        the original hardware that it is hard to see where
        one ends and the other begins.

        The alien structure seems to extend far back into
        the complex of machinery.  The plant thrums loudly,
        its functioning seemingly not impaired.

        INT. APC                                                 82

        Ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination.

                                  GORMAN
                   What is it?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know.

                                  GORMAN

        They enter the organic labyrinth, playing their
        lights over the walls.  Revealing a BIO-MECHANICAL
        LATTICE, like the marrow of some vast bone.  The air
        is thick with STEAM.  Trickling water.  The place
        seems almost alive.

        INT. APC                                                 84

        They watch in various helmet-camera P.O.V.'s of the
        wall detail.

        CLOSE ON VIDEO  as it PAN SLOWLY...REVEALING a
        bas-relief of detritus from the colony:  furniture,
        wiring, human bones, skulls...Fused together with a
        translucent, epoxylike substance.

                          (voice over; static)
                   Looks like some sort of secreted
                   resin.

                                  GORMAN
                   They ripped apart the colony
                   for building materials.

                   were done with them.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     85

        Steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper
        inside.

                                  FROST
                   Hotter'n hell in here.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah...but it's a dry
                   heat.

        INT. APC                                                 86

        Ripley leans forward suddenly, studying the graphic
        readout of the STATION GROUND PLAN.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right under the
                   primary heat exchangers.

                                  BURKE
                   Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like
                   the heat, that's why they built...

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's not what I mean.  Gorman,
                   if your men have to use their
                   weapons in there, they'll rupture
                   the cooling system.

                                  BURKE
                          (realizing)
                   She's right.

                                  GORMAN
                   So.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So...then the fusion
                   containment shuts down.

                                  GORMAN
                          (impatient)
                   So?  So?

                                  BURKE
                   We're talking thermonuclear
                   explosion.

                                  GORMAN
                   Shit.

                   Apone, collect magazines
                   from everybody.  We can't
                   have any firing in there.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     87

        The troopers look at each other in dismay.

                                  WIERZBOWSKI
                   Is he fucking crazy?

                                  HUDSON
                   What're we supposed to use,
                   man?  Harsh language?

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Flame-units only.  I want
                   rifles slung.

                                  APONE
                   Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

        He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines
        from each one's weapon.

        Vasquez turns hers over reluctantly.

        The three who are carrying them get out small
        incinerator units.  When Apone moves on, Vasquez
        slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts
        it in her weapon.  Drake does the same.  Hicks hangs
        back in the shadows.  He opens a cylindrical sheath
        attached to his battle-harness.  Slides out an
        old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt
        stock.  Chambers a round.

                                  HICKS
                          (low,
                          to Hudson)
                   I always keep this handy.
                   For close encounter.

                                  APONE
                          (o.s.)
                   Let's move.  Hicks, back
                   us up.

        INT. LARGER CHAMBER                                      88

        The air is thick.  Lights flare.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;
                          very faint)
                   Any movement?

        Hudson watches his tracker, scanning.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nothing.  Zip.

        Apone stops, his expression changing.  They face a
        wall of living horror.  The colonists have been
        brought here and entombed alive...

        COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices
        of the structure.  The cocoon material is the same
        translucent epoxy.  The bodies are frozen in
        carelessly twisted positions.  Macabre image of
        frozen agony.  Many are disiccated.  Skeletal.
        Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within.
        Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death
        as hosts for the embryos growing within then.

        Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures,
        perhaps the most "recent."  A WOMAN, ghost-white
        and drained.  The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...They
        seem to plead.

                                  DIETRICH
                   Sir!

        The woman's lips move feebly.

                                  WOMAN
                   Please...God...kill me.

        INT. APC                                                 89

        Ripley watches the woman, white knuckled.  The
        sound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      90

        The woman begins to convulse.  She SCREAMS, a
        sawing shriek of mindless agony.

                                  APONE
                   Flame thrower!  Move!

        Frost hands it to him.  Suddenly, the woman's chest
        EXPLODES in a gout of blood.  A SMALL FANGED HEAD
        EMERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY.

        Apone pulls the trigger.  Then the other troopers
        carrying flame throwers open fire.  An orgy of
        purging fire.  The cocoons vanish in the shimmering
        heat.

        A SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made from
        fingernails on blackboards.

        ANGLE ON WALL  as something begins to emerge.  Dimly
        glimpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature larger
        then a man.  Lying dormant, it had blended perfectly
        with the convoluted surface of fused bone.  The
        troopers don't see it.  Smoke from the burning cocoons
        quickly fills the confined space.  Visibility drops
        to zero.

                                  HUDSON

                   Talk to me, Hudson.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, seems to be in front
                   and behind.

        Gorman is plating with the gain controls on the
        monitors.

                                  GORMAN
                   We can't see anything back
                   here, Apone.  What's going on?

        Ripley senses it coming, like a wave at night.  Dark,
        terrifying and inevitable.

        as they come alive.  Bonelike, tubelike shapes shift,
        becoming emerging ALIENS.  Dimly glimpsed...glints
        of slime.  Silhouettes.

                   Go to infrared.  Looks sharp
                   people!

        The squad members snap down their image-intersifier
        visors.

                   Multiple signals.  All round.
                   Closing.

        Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower held
        tightly.  A nightmarish silhouette materializes out
        of the smoke behind her!  It strikes like lightning.
        SEIZES HER.  She fires reflexively, wild.  The jet
        of flame engulfs Frost nearby.

        Apone spins as the double SCREAM.  Can't see anything
        in the think smoke.

        INT. APC                                                 93

        Ripley watches Frost's monitor go black.  His
        bio-readouts flatten.  The other screens show glimpses
        of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens, the
        images bobbing and panning confusedly.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      94

        Vasquez nods to Drake with grim satisfaction.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Let's rock.

        They OPEN UP simultaneously, lighting up the smoke
        like welders' arcs.

                   Who's firing?  I ordered a

        Vasquez rips off her headset.  She is riveted to the
        targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting
        dance.  Thunder and lightning.  Better than sex for
        her.  FLASH-CRACK!  An alien SCREECH from the darkness.

        The battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens.
        Ripley flinches as another scream comes over the
        open frequency.  Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up.
        His life signs plummet.  Voices blend and overlap.

                                  HUDSON
                          (voice over)
                   Let's get the fuck out of
                   here!

                                  HICKS
                          (voice over)
                   Not that tunnel, the other
                   one!

                                  CROWE
                          (voice over)
                   You sure?  Watch it...behind
                   you.  Fucking move, will you!

        Gorman is ashen.  Confused.  Gulping for air like a
        grouper.  How could the situation have unravelled
        so fast?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Gorman)
                   GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO
                   IT NOW!

                                  GORMAN
                   Shut up.  Just shut up!

        CRASH!  Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was
        pulled.  Flat line.

                                  GORMAN
                   Uh,...Apone, I want you to
                   lay down a suppressing fire
                   with the incinerators and
                   fall back by squads to the
                   APC, over.

                                  APONE
                          (voice over;
                          heavy static)
                   Say again?  All after
                   incinerators?

        Ripley watches it fall apart.

                                  GORMAN
                   I said...

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      96

        Apone adjusts his headset.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   ...lay down (garbled) ...by
                   squads to...(garbled)

        Gorman's voice breaks up completely.  A SCREAM.
        Apone whirls, uncertain.

                                  APONE
                   Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound
                   off!  Wierzbowski?

        Nothing.  He spins.  Almost blows Hudson's head
        off.

                                  HUDSON
                          (freaked)
                   We're getting juked!  We're
                   gonna die in here!

        Apone hands him a magazine.  Hudson slaps it home,
        looking truly terrified.

                                  APONE
                   Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck
                   the heat exchanger!

        He FIRES.  Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a
        horrendous field of fire.  Strobe-bright flashes
        sear the darkness.  She pivots, firing mechanically
        in controlled bursts.  Scoring points in her own
        private video game.

        She SPINS as Hicks approached laterally.  WHAM!  She
        fires "at" him.  Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish
        figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by
        Vasquez' blast.

        INT. APC                                                 97

        Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK.

                                  GORMAN
                          (distantly)
                   I told them to fall back...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (viciously)
                   They're but off!  Do something!

        But he's gone.  Total brain-lock.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  as she struggles with a decision.
        She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to
        do.  But more than that, she's furious.  Shouldering
        past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the
        APC.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (in passing)
                   Newt, put your seatbelt on!

        Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC.  Takes
        a deep breath.  Starts slapping switches.

                                  GORMAN
                   Ripley, what the hell...?

        She slams the tractor into gear.

        EXT. APC                                                 98

        as the drive-wheels spin on the wet ground.  The
        massive machine leaps forward.

        INT. APC                                                 99

        Ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead
        as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway.
        She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators
        viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot.
        Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning
        his command center.

                                  GORMAN
                          (shrill)
                   What are you doing?  Turn
                   around!  That's an order!

        He claws at her, hysterical.  Burke pulls him off.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                    100

        The APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing
        away outcroppings of alien-encrustation.  Ripley hits
        the floodlights.  Strobe-beacon.  Siren.  She homes
        on the flash of weapons fire ahead.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                     101

        The APC crashes inside, showering debris.  Hicks,
        supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke.
        The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door
        open.

        Drake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as
        they fall back.

        Drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his
        smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower.

        Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and
        drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all.  She sees
        a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake.  She fires one burst,
        prone.  Clean body hit.

        The flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing
        open the thing's thorax.  A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW
        ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating
        into him like a hot knife through butter.  He drops
        in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame
        thrower.

        The jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls,
        engulfing the back half of the APC.

        INT. APC                                                102

        Vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots
        through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire.
        Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges,
        clawing out the opening.  He stops her, dragging her
        inside.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Drake!  He's down!

        Hicks screams right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   He's gone!  Forget it, he's
                   gone!

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (irrational)
                   No.. No, he's not.  He's --

        Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Ripley)
                   Let's go!

        Ripley jams reverse.  Nails the throttle.  The APC
        bellows backward up the ramp.  Hudson disappears
        under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks
        free.  Hicks gets the door almost closed.  Suddenly
        CLAWS appear at the edge.  Newt screams.  Against
        the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez
        the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE.
        Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman.

                                  HICKS
                   Get on the Goddamn door!

        Gorman backs away, eyes wide.  Hicks jams his shoulder
        against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise
        his 12-gauge.  An alien head wedges through the opening,
        its hideous mouth opening.  And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN
        MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger!  BLAM!
        The creature is flung backward, its shattered head
        fountaining acid blood.  The spray eats into the door,
        the deck, hits Hudson on the arm.  He shrieks.  They
        slide the door home and dog it tight.

        EXT. APC                                                103

        The armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp.  Slams
        into a mass of conduit.  Tears free.  Ripley works the
        shifters, pivoting the massive machine.  Everybody's
        shouting, trying to put out the fire.  Pandemonium.

        INT./EXT. APC                                           104-
                                                                105

        Something lands on the roof with a metallic clang.

        Gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far
        from the door as possible.  A latch lever behind his
        head turns.  The small hatch against which he was
        leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out
        the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek,
        legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling
        him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and
        buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder.
        Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE
        and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up
        as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon,
        a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc.
        VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's
        armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped
        unconscious, is dragged back inside.

        The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for
        clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet.
        Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews,
        broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office
        furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in
        the APC's wake.

        Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of
        Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening,
        hideous jaws lunge inside...

        Ripley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same
        mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams
        both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge
        wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the
        headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars
        forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal
        body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls,
        tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine
        thunders onto the causeway and away from the station.

        A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming
        from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand
        back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled.

                                  HICKS
                   It's okay...we're clear.  We're
                   clear.  Ease up.

        The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she
        slows the machine.

                                  HICKS
                   Sounds like a blown transaxle.
                   You're just grinding metal.

        EXT. APC                                                106

        The tractor limps to a halt.  A HALF-KILOMETER from the
        atmosphere processing station.  The APC is a smoking,
        acid-scarred mess.

        INT. APC                                                107

        Ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins
        out of her seat into the aisle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt?  Where's Newt?

        Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down.  Newt
        is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat
        and a bulkhead.  She is trembling, and looks terrified,
        but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You okay?

        Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic.  Ripley goes
        back to the others.  Hudson is holding his arm and
        staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all
        back in his mind.

                                  HUDSON
                   Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe
                   it.

        Burke tries to have a look at Hudson's arm.

                                  HUDSON
                          (jerking away)
                   I'm all right, leave it!

        Ripley joins Hicks who is bent over Gorman, checking
        for a pulse.

                                  HICKS
                   He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   He's fucking dead!

        She grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly,
        ready to pulp him with her other fist.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (to Gorman)
                   Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill
                   you, you useless fuck!

        Hicks pushes her back.  Right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right
                   now.

        Vasquez releases Gorman.  His head smacks the deck.
        Ripley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless
        purple puncture wound.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Looks like it stung him.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and
                   Dietrich aren't dead, man.

        They turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointing
        at the bio-function screens.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be like Gorman.  Their
                   signs are real low but they ain't
                   dead!

        Hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around
        the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them
        as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just
        at the edges of their minds.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You can't help them.  Right now
                   they're being cocooned just like
                   the others.

                                  HUDSON
                          (sagging)
                   Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't
                   happening.

        Ripley and Vasquez lock eyes.  Ripley doesn't want
        it to be "I told you so" but Vasquez reads it that
        way.  She turns away with a snap.

        INT. MED LAB                                            108

        Bishop is hunched over an occular probe doing a
        dissection of one of the dead parasites.  Spunkmeyer
        enters with some electronics gear on a hand truck
        and parks it near Bishop's work table.

                                  SPUNKMEYER
                   Need anything else?

        Bishop waves "no" without looking up.

        EXT. COLONY - DROP-SHIP                                 109

        Spunkmeyer emerges, crossing the Tarmac to the loading
        ramp of the ship.  As he nears the top of the ramp,
        his boot slips...skidding on something wet.  Kneeling,
        he touches a small puddle of thick slime.  He shrugs,
        and hits the controls to retract the ramp and close
        the doors.

        INT. APC                                                110

        ON VASQUEZ  wired and intense.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   All right, we can't blow the fuck
                   out of them...why not roll some
                   canisters of CN-20 down there.
                   Nerve gas the whole nest?

                                  HUDSON
                   Look, man, let's just bug out and
                   call it even, okay?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   No good.  How do we know it'll
                   effect their biochemistry?  I say
                   we take off and nuke the entire
                   site from orbit.  It's the only
                   way to be sure.

                                  BURKE
                   Now hold on a second.  I'm not
                   authorizing that action.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

        Burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals
        flawlessly into conciliatory mode.

                                  BURKE
                   Well, I mean...I know this is an
                   emotional moment, but let's not
                   make snap judgments.  Let's move
                   cautiously.  First, this physical
                   installation had a substantial
                   dollar value attached to it --

                                  RIPLEY
                   They can bill me.  I got a tab
                   running.  What's second?

                                  BURKE
                   This is clearly an important
                   species we're dealing with here.
                   We can't just arbitrarily
                   exterminate them --

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bullshit!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe you haven't been keeping up
                   on current events, but we just got
                   out asses kicked, pal!

        Ripley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.

        Burke moves in, lowering his voice.  He takes her aside
        from the others.

                                  BURKE
                   I know, I know, but we're dealing
                   with changing scenarios here.  This
                   thing is major, Ripley.  I mean
                   really major.  You gotta go with
                   its energy.  Since you are the
                   representative of the company who
                   discovered this species your
                   percentage will naturally be
                   some serious, serious money.

        Ripley stares at his like he's a particularly
        disagreeable fungus.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You son of a bitch.

                                  BURKE
                          (hardening)
                   Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks
                   has authority here.

                                  BURKE
                   Corporal Hicks!?

                                  RIPLEY
                   This operation is under military
                   jurisdiction and Hicks is next in
                   chain of command.  Right?

                                  HICKS
                   Looks that way.

        Burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.

                                  BURKE
                   Look, this is a multimillion
                   dollar operation.  He can't make
                   that kind of decision.  He's just
                   a grunt!
                          (glances at Hicks)
                   No offense.

                                  HICKS
                          (coolly)
                   None taken.
                          (into mike)
                   Ferro, you copying?

                                  FERRO
                          (voice over; static)
                   Standing by.

                                  HICKS
                   Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna
                   need an immediate evac.
                          (to Burke)
                   I think we'll take off and nuke
                   the site from orbit.  It's the
                   only way to be sure.

        He winks.  Burke looks like a kid whose toy has been
        snatched.

                                  BURKE
                   This is absurd!  You don't have
                   the authority to --

        CLACK!  The sound of a rifle bolt snapping home
        truncates his rant.  Vasquez has a pulse-rifle cradled,
        not exactly aimed at Burke but not exactly aimed away
        either.  Her expression is masklike.  End of discussion.

        Ripley sits behind Newt, putting her arm around her.

                                  RIPLEY
                   We're going home, honey.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                          111

        The ship rises through the spray thrown up by the
        downblast of the VTOL jets, hovering above the complex
        like a huge insect, its searchlights blazing.

        EXT. APC                                                112

        The group is filing out of the personnel carrier, which
        is clearly a write off.  Hicks and Hudson have Gorman
        between them, and the others emerge into the wind.
        They watch the ship roar in on its final approach.

        INT. DROP-SHOP COCKPIT                                  113

        Ferro flicks the intercom switch several times.  Thumps
        her headset mike.

                                  FERRO
                   Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.

        The compartment door behind her slides slowly back.

                                  FERRO
                          (turning)
                   Where the fu --

        Her eyes widen.  It's not Spunkmeyer.

        Am impression of leering jaws which blur forward, then
        a whirl of motion and a truncated scream.  The throttle
        levers are slammed forward in the melee.

        EXT. APC - LANDSCAPE - STATION                          114

        They watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and
        VEERS WILDLY.  Its main engines ROAR FULL ON and the
        craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude.
        It skims the ground.  Clips a rock formation.  The
        ship slews, sideslipping.  It hits a ridge.  Tumbles,
        bursting into flame, breaking up.  It arcs into the
        air, end over end, a Catherine wheel juggernaut.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Run!

        She grabs Newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling
        section of the ship's massive engine module slams
        into the APC and it explodes into twisted wreckage.

        The drop-ship skips again, like a stone, engulfed in
        flames...AND CRASHES INTO THE STATION.  A TREMENDOUS
        FIREBALL.

        The remainder of the ground team watches their hopes
        of getting off the planet, and most of their superior
        fire power, reduced to flaming debris.

        There is a moment of stunned silence, then...

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Well that's great!  That's just
                   fucking great, man.  Now what the
                   fuck are we supposed to do, man?
                   We're in some real pretty shit now!

                                  HICKS
                   Are you finished?
                          (to Ripley)
                   You okay?

        She nods.  She can't disguise her stricken expression
        when she looks at Newt, but the little girl seems
        relatively calm.  She shrugs with fatalistic acceptance.

                                  NEWT
                   I guess we're not leaving, right?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'm sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   You don't have to be sorry.  It
                   wasn't your fault.

                                  HUDSON
                          (kicking rocks)
                   Just tell me what the fuck we're
                   supposed to do now.  What're we
                   gonna do now?

                                  BURKE
                          (annoyed)
                   May be could build a fire and
                   sing songs.

                                  NEWT
                   We should get back, 'cause it'll
                   be dark soon.  They come mostly
                   at night.  Mostly.

        Ripley follows Newt's look to the AP station looming
        in the twilight, the burning drop-ship wreckage jammed
        into its basal structure.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK - NIGHT                              115

        The wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings,
        dry and cold.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         116

        The weary and demoralized group is gathered to take
        stock of their grim options.  Vasquez and Hudson are
        just setting down a scorched and dented packing case,
        one of several culled from the APC wreckage.

        Hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons,
        lying on a table.

                                  HICKS
                   This is all we could salvage.  We've
                   got four pulse-rifles with about
                   fifty rounds each.  Not so good.
                   About fifteen M-40 grenades and
                   two flame throwers less than
                   half full...one damaged.  And
                   We've got four of these
                   robot-sentry units with scanners
                   and display intact.

        He opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a
        high-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optical
        sensing equipment, packed in foam.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long after we're declared
                   overdue can we expect a rescue?

                                  HICKS
                   About seventeen days.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, we're not going to make it
                   seventeen hours!  Those things
                   are going to come in here, just
                   like they did before, man...
                   they're going to come in here
                   and get us, man, long before...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She survived longer than that
                   with no weapons and no training.

        Ripley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So you better just start dealing
                   with it.  Just deal with it,
                   Hudson...because we need you and
                   I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now
                   get on a terminal and call up some
                   kind of floor plan file.
                   Construction blueprints,
                   maintenance schematics, anything
                   that shows the layout of this
                   place.  I want to see air ducts,
                   electrical access tunnels,
                   subbasements.  Every possible way
                   into this wing.

        Hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction.
        Hicks nods approval of her handling of it.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'll be in medical.  I'd like to
                   continue my analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Fine.  You do that.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         117

        Burke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a large
        HORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table.
        Newt hops from one foot to the other to see.

                                  RIPLEY
                   This service tunnel is how they're
                   moving back and forth.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah, right, it runs from the
                   processing station right into
                   the sublevel here.

        He traces a finger along the abstract ground plan.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  There's a fire door
                   at this end.  The first thing we
                   do is put a remote sentry in the
                   tunnel and seal that door.

                                  HICKS
                   We gotta figure on them getting
                   into the complex.

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.  So we put up
                   welded barricades at these
                   intersections...
                          (pointing)
                   ...and seal these ducts here
                   and here.  Then they can only
                   come at us from these two
                   corridors and we create a free
                   field of fire for the other
                   two sentry units, here.

        Hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand,
        satisfied.

                                  HICKS
                   Outstanding.  Then all we need's
                   a deck of cards.  All right, let's
                   move like we got a purpose.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.

                                  NEWT

                   Aye-firmative!

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVEL                          118

        A long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit,
        seems to go on forever.  Vasquez and Hudson have
        finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on
        tripods in the tunnel.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   Testing!

        She hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the
        automatic field of fire.  The sentry guns swivel
        smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled
        by two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS into
        dime-sized shrapnel.  They retreat behind a heavy steel
        FIRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track.  Vasquez,
        using a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the door
        to its frame, as Hudson paces nervously.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hudson here.  A and B
                   sentries are in place and
                   keyed.  We're sealing the
                   tunnel.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL CORRIDOR                              119

        Hicks pauses in his work.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.

        He and Ripley are covering an air duct opening with
        a metal plate, welding it in place, showering sparks
        in the dark corridor.  Behind them Burke and Newt
        are moving back and forth with cartons of food on a
        hand truck, stacking it inside the operations center.
        Hicks sets down his welder and pulls a small object
        out of a belt pouch.  A braceletlike EMERGENCY
        LOCATING BEEPER.

                                  HICKS
                   Here, put this on.  Then
                   I can locate you anywhere
                   in the complex on this --

        He indicates a tiny TRACKER hooked to his battle
        harness.  He shrugs, a little self-consciously.

                                  HICKS
                   Just a...precaution.  You
                   know.

        Ripley pauses for a moment, regarding him
        quizzically.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (strapping
                          it on)
                   Thanks.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, what's next?

        She consults a printout of the floor plan.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK                                      120

        The wind has died utterly and in the even more eerie
        stillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shroud
        the complex.  Visibility is low in the fog.
        Everything looks underwater.  There is no movement.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           121

        In the barricaded corridor sentry-gun "C" sits waiting,
        its "ARMED" light flashing green.  Through a hole
        torn in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor
        the fog swirls in.  Water drips.  An expectant hush.

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX - OPERATING ROOM                     122

        Ripley carries an exhausted Newt through the inner
        connecting rooms of the medical wing.  She reaches
        an OPERATING ROOM which is small but very high-tech
        ...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment.
        Several metal cots have been set up, displacing O.R.
        equipment which is pushed into one corner.

        Newt is resting her head on Ripley's shoulder, barely
        awake...out of steam.  Ripley sets her on one of
        the cots and Newt lies down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now you just lie here and
                   have a nap.  You're exhausted.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want to...I have
                   scary dreams.

        This obviously strikes a chord with Ripley, but she
        feigns cheerfulness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll bet Casey doesn't have
                   bad dreams.

        Ripley lifts the doll's head from Newt's tiny fingers
        and looks inside.  It is, of course, empty.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Nothing bad in here.  Maybe
                   you could just try to be like
                   her.

        Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back.
        Newt rolls her eyes as if to say "don't pull that
        five-year-old shit on me, lady.  I'm six."

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley...she doesn't have
                   bad dreams because she's just
                   a piece of plastic.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh.  Sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   My mommy always said there
                   were no monsters.  No real
                   ones.  But there are.

        Ripley's expression becomes sober.  She brushes damp
        hair back from the child's pale forehead.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Yes, there are, aren't there.

                                  NEWT
                   Why do they tell little kids
                   that?

        Newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal.
        She's seen that the world can be just as terrifying
        as her most primal child's nightmare if not more
        so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is
        no Santa.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, some kids can't handle
                   it like you can.

                                  NEWT
                   Did one of those things grow
                   inside her?

        Ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in
        around her tiny body.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, Newt.  That's
                   the truth.

                                  NEWT
                   Isn't that how babies come?
                   I mean people babies...they
                   grow inside you?

                                  RIPLEY
                   No, it's different, honey.

                                  NEWT
                   Did you ever have a baby?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes.  A little girl.

                                  NEWT
                   Where is she?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Gone.

                                  NEWT
                   You mean dead.

        It's more statement than question.  Ripley nods slowly.

        She turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATER
        sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed.  She
        switches it on.  It HUMS and emits a cozy orange
        glow.

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley, I was just thinking...
                   Maybe I could do you a favor and
                   fill in for her.  Just for a
                   while.  You can try it and if
                   you don't like it, it's okay.
                   I'll understand.  No big deal.
                   Whattya think?

        Ripley gazes at her a long time before answering...
        a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her
        in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them
        may see another dawn.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I think it's not the worst idea
                   I've heard all day.  Let's talk
                   about it later.

        She switches off the light and starts to rise.  Newt
        grabs her arm.  A plaintive voice in the dark.

                                  NEWT
                   Don't go!  Please.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll be right in the other
                   room, Newt.  And look...I can
                   see you on that camera right
                   up there.

        Newt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door.
        Ripley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her by
        Hicks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching it
        down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.  Take is for luck.  Now
                   go to sleep...and don't dream.

        Ripley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, hugging
        Casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function
        light on the bracelet.  The space heater hums
        comfortingly.

        INT. MED LAB                                            123

        ECU Gorman, his eyelids slitted open like those of a
        corpse, but with the eyes tracking erratically.  The
        only sign of life.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   How is he?

        Ripley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lying
        motionless on an examining table.  Bishop looks up
        from his instruments nearby, the light of a single
        gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.

                                  BISHOP
                   I've isolated a neuro-muscular
                   toxin responsible for the
                   paralysis.  It seems to be
                   metabolizing.  He should wake
                   up soon.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now let me get this straight.
                   The aliens paralyzed the colonists,
                   carried them over there,
                   cocooned them to be hosts for
                   more of those...

        Ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the
        face-hugger specimens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Which would mean lots of
                   those parasites, right?  One
                   for each person...over a hundred
                   at least.

                                  BISHOP
                   Yes.  That follows.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But these things come from
                   eggs...so where are all the
                   eggs coming from.

                                  BISHOP
                   That is the question of the
                   hour.  We could assume a parallel
                   to certain insect forms who
                   have hivelike organization.
                   An ant of termite colony, for
                   example, is ruled by a single
                   female, a queen, which is the
                   source of new eggs.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're saying one of those things
                   lays all the eggs?

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, the queen is always physically
                   larger then the others.  A
                   termite queen's abdomen is so
                   bloated with eggs that it can't
                   move at all.  It is fed and tended
                   by drone workers, defended by
                   the warriors.  She is the center
                   of their lives, quite literally
                   the  mother of their society.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Could it be intelligent?

                                  BISHOP
                   Hard to say.  It may have been
                   blind instinct...attraction to
                   the heat of whatever...but she
                   did choose to incubate her eggs
                   in the one spot where we couldn't
                   destroy her without destroying
                   ourselves.  That's if she exists,
                   of course.

        Ripley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (rising)
                   I want those specimens destroyed
                   as soon as you're done with them.
                   You understand?

        Bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently
        in their cylinders.

                                  BISHOP
                   Mr. Burke have instructions
                   that they were to be kept alive
                   in stasis for return to the
                   company labs.  He was very specific.

        Ripley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing.
        She slaps the intercom switch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      124

        In a small observation chamber separated from the med
        lab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke have
        squared off.

                                  BURKE
                   Those specimens are worth
                   millions to the bio-weapons
                   division.  Now, if you're smart
                   we can both come out of this
                   heroes.  Set up for life.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You just try getting a dangerous
                   organism past ICC quarantine.
                   Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

                                  BURKE
                   You've been doing your homework.
                   Look, they can't impound it if
                   they don't know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they will know about it, Burke.
                   From me.  Just like they'll know
                   how you were responsible for the
                   deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven
                   colonists here --

                                  BURKE
                   Now, wait a second --

                                  RIPLEY
                          (stepping on him)
                   You sent them to that ship.  I
                   just checked the colony log...
                   directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.
                   Signed Burke, Carter J.

        Ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and
        rage finally have a target to focus on.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You sent them out there and you
                   didn't even warn them, Burke.
                   Why didn't you warn them?

                                  BURKE
                   Look, maybe the thing didn't even
                   exist, right?  And if I'd made it
                   a major security situation, the
                   Administration would've stepped
                   in.  Then no exclusive rights,
                   nothing.

        He shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.

                                  BURKE
                   It was a bad call, that's all.

        Ripley snaps.  She slams him against the wall, surprising
        herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bad call?  These people are fucking
                   dead, Burke!  Well, they're going
                   to nail your hide to the shed...
                   and I'll be there when they do.

        She steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter
        loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far
        more horrific revelation than any alien.

                                  BURKE
                          (sadly)
                   I expected more of you, Ripley.
                   I thought you would be smarter
                   than this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Sorry to disappoint you.

        She turns away and strides out.  The door closes.
        Burke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           125

        Ripley is walking toward operations when a STRIDENT
        ALARM begins to sound.  She breaks into a run.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         126

        Ripley double-times it to Hicks' TACTICAL CONSOLE
        where Hudson and Vasquez have already gathered.  Hicks
        slaps a switch, killing the alarm.

                                  HICKS
                   They're coming.  They're in
                   the tunnel.

        The TRILLING of the motion sensor remains, speeding up.
        TWO RED LIGHTS on the tactical display light up
        simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which
        vibrates the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing
                   on multiple targets.

        The RSS guns pound away, echoing through the complex.
        Their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm.
        A counter on the display counts down the number of
        rounds fired.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be wall to wall in
                   there.  Look  at those ammo counters
                   go.  It's a shooting gallery down
                   there.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - TIGHT ON RSS GUNS                 127

        blasting stroboscopically in the tunnels.  Their barrels
        are overheating, glowing cherry red.  One CLICKS empty
        and sits smoking, still swiveling to track targets it
        can't fire upon.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         128

        The digital counter on B gun reads zero.

                                  HICKS
                   B gun's dry.  Twenty on A.
                   Ten.  Five.  That's it.

        SILENCE.  Then a GONGLIKE BOOMING echoes eerily up from
        sublevel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're at the fire door.

        The BOOMING INCREASES in volume and ferocity.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, listen to that.

        Mixed with the echoing crash-clang is a nerve-wrecking
        SCREECH of claws on steel.  The intercom buzzes,
        startling them.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over)
                   Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have
                   some bad news.

                                  HUDSON
                   Well, that's a switch.

        INT. OPERATIONS - MINUTES LATER                         129

        Everyone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window,
        intently watching the AP station which is a dim
        silhouette in the mist.  Suddenly a column of flame,
        like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex
        at the base of the cone.

                                  BISHOP
                   That's it.  See it?  Emergency
                   venting.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long until it blows?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm projecting total systems
                   failure in a little under four
                   hours.  The blast radius will be
                   about thirty kilometers.  About
                   equal to ten megatons.

                                  HICKS
                   We got problems.

                                  HUDSON
                   I don't fucking believe this.
                   Do you believe this?

                                  RIPLEY
                   And it's too late to shut it down?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm afraid so.  The crash did too
                   much damage.  The overload is
                   inevitable, at this point.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short,
                   too!  Four more weeks and out.
                   Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'
                   rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Hudson, give us a break.

        They watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shrouded
        landscape.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Hicks)
                   We need the other drop-ship.  The
                   on one the Sulaco.  We have to
                   bring it down on remote, somehow.

                                  HUDSON
                   How?  The transmitter was on the
                   APC.  It's wasted.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (pacing)
                   I don't care how!  Think of a
                   way.  Think of something.

                                  HUDSON
                   Think of what?  We're fucked.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about the colony transmitter?
                   That up-link tower down at the
                   other end.  Why can't we use that?

                                  BISHOP
                   I checked.  The hard wiring
                   between here and there was severed
                   in the fighting.

        Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out
        options, grim solutions.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well then somebody's just going
                   to have to go out there.  Take a
                   portable terminal and go out there
                   and plug in manually.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, right!  Right!  With those
                   things running around.  No way.

                                  BISHOP
                          (quietly)
                   I'll go.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm really the only one qualified
                   to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
                   Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I
                   may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll
                   you need?

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Listen.  It's stopped.

        They listen.  Nothing.  An instant later comes the
        HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm.  Hicks
        looks at the tactical board.

                                  HICKS
                   Well, they're into the complex.

        INT. MED LAB                                            130

        One of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has
        yielded access to subfloor conduits.  Bishop lying in
        the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal
        as Ripley hands it down to him.  He pushes it into
        the constricted shaft ahead of him.  She then hands him
        a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch
        cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.

                                  BISHOP
                   This duct runs almost to the
                   up-link assembly.  One hundred
                   eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes
                   to crawl down there.  One hour
                   to patch in and align the antenna.
                   Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
                   then about fifty minutes flight time.

        Ripley looks at her watch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's going to be closer.  You
                   better get going.

                                  BISHOP
                          (cheerfully)
                   See you soon.

        She squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along
        ahead of him with a scraping rhythm.  The diameter of
        the conduit is barely larger than the width of his
        shoulders.  Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole
        and begins spot welding it in place.

        INT. CONDUIT                                            131

        Bishop looks back as the welder seals him in.  He sighs
        fatalistically and squirms forward.  Ahead of him the
        conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity.  Like
        being in the bore of a very long Howitzer.

        INT. MED LAB                                            132

        Ripley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through the
        complex.

                                  HICKS
                          (voice over)
                   They're in the approach corridor.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (into mike)
                   On my way.

        Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from her
        shoulder in one motion, and sprints for Operations with
        Vasquez.  The sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up in
        staccato bursts echoes from close by.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         133

        Ripley runs to the tactical console where Hicks is
        mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras.
        The flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive
        video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky
        corridor are occasionally visible.  The robot sentries
        hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into
        the swirling mist.

                                  HICKS
                   Twenty meters and closing.
                   Fifteen.  C and D guns down
                   about fifty percent.

        The digital readout whirl through descending numbers.
        An inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between bursts
        of fire.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now many?

                                  HICKS
                   Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's
                   down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

        Then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly.
        The video image is a swirling wall of smoke.  Small fires
        burn, dim glows in the mist.  There are black and
        twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered
        at the edge of visibility.  However, nothing emerges
        from the wall of smoke.  The motion sensor TONE shuts off.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They retreated.  The guns stopped
                   them.

        The moment stretches.  Everyone exhales slowly.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  But look...

        The digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0"
        and "10" respectively.  Less than a second's worth of
        firing.

                                  HICKS
                   Newt time then can walk right
                   up and knock.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they don't know that.  They're
                   probably looking for other ways
                   to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Vasquez
                          and Hudson)
                   I want you two walking the perimeter.
                   I know we're all in strung out
                   shape but stay frosty and alert.
                   We've got to stop any entries before
                   they get out of hand.

        The two troopers nod and head for the corridor.  Ripley
        sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it in
        one gulp.

                                  HICKS
                   How long since you slept?
                   Twenty-four hours?

        Ripley shrugs.  She seems soul weary, drained by the
        nerve-wracking tension.  When she answers, her voice
        seems distant, detached.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (grimly)
                   They'll get us.

                                  HICKS
                   Maybe.  Maybe not.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like
                   those others.  You'll take care of
                   it won't you, it if comes to that?

                                  HICKS
                   If it comes to that, I'll do us
                   both.  Let's see that it doesn't
                   Here, I'd like to introduce you to
                   a close personal friend of mine.

        He picks up his pulse-rifle and with the casually precise
        movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drops
        out the magazine and hands it to her.

                                  HICKS
                   M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and
                   under with a 30mm pump-action
                   grenade launcher.

        Ripley hefts the weapon.  It is heavy and awkward.  But
        there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal
        cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will
        be in some greater measure the master of her own fate.
        She raises it clumsily.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What do I do?

        INT. CONDUIT                                            134

        Bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing
        infinities.  The pipe rings with his scraping advance.
        He approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny
        shaft of light.  He puts his eyes up to the acid-etched
        opening.

        HIS P.O.V.  as drooling jaws flash toward us, SLAMMING
        against the steel with a vicious scraping SNAP.

        Bishop flattens himself away from the opening and
        inches along, looking pale and strained.  He glances at
        his watch.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         135

        Ripley has the stock of the M-41A snugged up to her cheek
        and is awkwardly trying to keep up with Hicks'
        instructions.  The Corporal is standing close behind her,
        positioning her arms.  It's intimate but that's the
        last thing on their minds.

                                  HICKS
                   Just pull it in real right.  It
                   will kick some.  When the counter
                   here heads zero, hit this...

        He thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clattering
        on the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Just let it drop right out.  Get
                   the other one in quick.  Just
                   slap it in hard, it likes abuse.
                   Now, pull the bolt.

        CLACK.

                                  HICKS
                   You're ready again.

        Ripley repeats the action, not very smoothly.  Her hands
        are trembling.  She indicates a stout TUBE underneath
        the slender pulse-rifle barrel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What's this?

                                  HICKS
                   Well, that's the grenade launcher
                   ...you probably don't want to
                   mess with that.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, you started this.  Now show
                   me everything.  I can handle myself.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  I've noticed.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           136

        DOLLYING WITH Ripley walking down the corridor, now
        carrying the newfound friend, the M-41A.  Gorman steps
        out of the door to the med lab, looking weak but sound.
        Burke is right behind him.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How do you feel?

                                  GORMAN
                   All right, I guess.  One hell
                   of a hangover.  Look, Ripley...
                   I...

                                  RIPLEY
                   Forget it.

        She shoulders by him into the med lab.  Gorman turns to
        see Vasquez staring at him with cold, slitted eyes.

                                  GORMAN
                   You still want to kill me?

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (turning away)
                   It won't be necessary.

        INT. MED LAB - ANNEX                                    137

        Ripley crosses the deserted lab, passing through the
        annex to the small O.R. where she left Newt.

        INT. MED LAB - O.R.                                     138

        Entering the darkened chamber, Ripley looks around.
        Newt is nowhere to be seen.  On a hunch she kneels down
        and peers under the bed.  Newt is curled up there,
        jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep.  Still
        clutching "Casey."

        Ripley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite
        the demons that have chased her through her dreams and
        the reality between dreams.  Ripley lays the rifle on
        top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.  Without
        waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her.

        Ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling
        together in the darkness under their bed.

        Newt's face contorts with the externalization of some
        tormented dreamscape.  She cries out, a vague inarticulate
        plea.  Ripley rocks her gently.

                                  RIPLEY
                   There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all
                   right.

        EXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION                 139

        A VIEW OF the processing station from the colony landing
        platform.  A rising wind is clearing out the low fog and
        the silhouette of the station grows sharper.  Several
        systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the
        conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in
        the darkness.  High voltage discharges arc around the
        upper latticework, lighting the blighted landscape
        with irregular glaring flashes.

        PAN ONTO BISHOP, F.G.  hunched against the wind at the
        base of the telemetry tower.  He has a TEST-BAY PANEL
        open and the portable terminal patched in.  His jacket
        is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect
        it from the elements and he is typing frenetically.

                                  BISHOP
                          (to himself)
                   Now, if I did it right...

        He punches a key marked "ENABLE."

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT                       140

        The drop bay is empty and silent, with the remaining
        ship brooding in the shadows.  A KLAXON sounds and
        rotating clearance lights come on.  Hydraulics whine
        to life.  Drop-ship two moves out on its overhead track
        and is lowered into the drop bay fro launch-prep.
        Service booms and fueling couplers move in automatically
        around the hull.  A recorded announcement echoes across
        the huge chamber.

                                  FEMALE VOICE
                   Attention.  Attention.  Automatic
                   fueling operations have begun.
                   Please extinguish all smoking
                   materials.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - MED LAB         141

        as she awakens with a start.  She checks her watch...
        an hour has passed.  She gently disengages herself from
        Newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot
        when she sees something and FREEZES.

        Across the room, just inside the door to the med lab,
        are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects.
        TWO STASIS CYLINDERS.  Their tops are hinged open, and
        the suspension fields are switched off.  They are both
        EMPTY.  Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror
        rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the
        inescapable certainty of a lethal presence.  Unable to
        move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing
        the situation.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Newt.  Newt, wake up.

                                  NEWT
                   Wah...?  Where are...?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in
                   trouble.

        Newt nods, now wide awake.  They listen in the darkness
        for the slightest betrayal of movement.  The scrabble
        of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example.

        There is only the droning HUM of the little space heater.
        Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the
        underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the
        wall.

        The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor
        is jarringly loud in the stillness.

        When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
        herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot,
        reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
        mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle
        is GONE.

        She snaps her head around.  A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS
        TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed!  She ducks with
        a startled cry.  The obscene thing hits the wall above
        her, legs moving lightning fast.  Reflexively she slams
        the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches
        above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with
        incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing
        SQUEAL.

        Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a
        frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She
        flips it over, trapping the creature underneath.

        They back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around
        the shadowed room where every corner of space
        between equipment holds lethal promise.  The creature
        scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a
        back of cabinets in a blur.  Ripley hugs Newt close
        and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in
        the room had a million volts running through it.  She
        reaches the door.  Hits the wall switch.  Nothing
        happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights.
        Nothing.  She pounds on the door.  The acoustically
        dampened door panel thunks dully.  She moves to the
        observation window, glancing frantically over her
        shoulder.  The bare floor behind her is like a screaming
        threat.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (shouting)
                   Hey...hey!

        She pounds on the window.  Through the double
        thickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark and
        empty.  Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling
        behind her.  Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her
        fear.  She steps in front of the video surveillance
        camera and waves her arms in a circle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks!  Hicks!

        INT. OPERATIONS - TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR                142

        showing Ripley waving her arms.  There is no sound,
        a surreal pantomime.

        A hand ENTERS FRAME and switches off the monitor.
        Ripley's image vanishes.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Burke straightens casually from
        the console.  Hicks is talking via headset with
        Bishop and hasn't noticed Ripley's plight or
        Burke's action.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.  Check back when you've
                   activated the ship.
                          (turning)
                   He's at the up-link tower.

                                  BURKE
                          (calmly)
                   Excellent.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     143

        Ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against
        the observation window.  It bounces back from the
        high-impact material.  She tries again.

        REVERSE ANGLE  from the med lab side, showing her
        futile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWACK
        barely audible through the double thickness pressure
        port.

        Ripley turns, studying the room.  She fumbles through
        a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and
        finds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT.  Snapping it on she
        plays the beam over the walls.  Tall assemblies of
        surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the
        dark.  She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements.  The
        light spins across the room, swiveling and bobbing
        frantically.  Like an indicator of her growing panic.
        Newt starts a thin, high wailing.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...mommmyyyyy...

        Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and
        the child's dependence on her.  She plays the beam
        across the ceiling.  Holds on something.  Gets an idea.
        She removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks
        up some papers from the counter.  Moving cautiously
        she boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the center
        of the room and clambers up after her.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm
                   scared.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I know, honey.  Me too.

        Ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass
        under the temperature sensor of a fire control system
        SPRINKLER HEAD.  It triggers, spraying the room from
        several sources with water.  An ALARM sounds throughout
        the complex.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         144

        Hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm, finally
        identifying its source among the lights flashing on
        his board.  He bolts for the door, yelling into his
        headset as he moves.

                                  HICKS
                   Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in
                   medical!  We got a fire!

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     145

        Ripley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers
        continue to drizzle in the darkness.  The SIREN
        hoots maniacally, masking all other sound.  Ripley
        scans the room with her light, her hair plastered
        to her face, wiping water out of her eyes.  She is
        eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She
        looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.
        Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT
        HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table,
        splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles
        away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of
        her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings
        for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a
        steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling
        equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the
        floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of
        multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.

        She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for
        its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head,
        avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly,
        backing away, until she is pressed up against a
        desk in one corner.

        Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body
        back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around
        her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside
        of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about,
        knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.
        Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her
        and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's
        body.

        ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the
        desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking
        fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the
        writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against
        all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.
        She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
        gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing
        itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.

        The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's
        head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
        from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly
        from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing
        itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
        her face.

        A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette
        behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot.
        Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of
        pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks
        dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
        into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits
        rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and
        slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the
        thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between
        the two of them they force is away from her face,
        though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
        sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the
        room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding
        across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature
        against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke.

        Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail,
        unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor
        coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling,
        SHRIEKING creature.

                                  HICKS
                   The corner!  Ready?

                                  HUDSON
                   Do it!

        Hicks hurls the thing into the corner.  It scrabbles
        upright in an instant and leaps back toward them.
        WHAM!  Hudson gets it clean.

        Ripley collapses, gagging.  The alarm and sprinklers
        shut off automatically.  Hicks sees the stasis
        cylinders.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (coughing)
                   Burke...it was Burke.

        INT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSON                       146

        looking decidedly stressed-out.  He grips his rifle
        tightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA.

                                  HUDSON
                          (intense)
                   I say we grease this rat-fuck
                   son of a bitch right now!

        THE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in a
        chair, maintaining an icy calm although beads of
        sweat betray intense concealed tension.  Only a few
        minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on
        adrenaline, as if the whole group is charged with
        high voltage.

                                  HICKS
                          (pacing)
                   I don't get it.  It doesn't
                   make any Goddamn sense.

        Ripley stands in front of Burke, every fiber of
        her being accusing him with absolute outrage.  Burke
        tries to break Ripley's stare, which is like a
        diamond drill.  He can't.

                                  RIPLEY
                   He wanted an alien, only he
                   couldn't get it back through
                   quarantine.  But if we were impregnated
                   ...whatever you call it...and then
                   frozen for the trip back at just
                   the right time...then nobody would
                   know about the embryos we were carrying.
                   We and Newt.

        Ripley glances at the little girl, a frail figure
        sitting nearby, hugging her knees and watching the
        proceedings with somber eyes.  She is all but lost in
        an adult jacket someone has found for her, and her still
        damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks.

                                  HICKS
                   Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The only way it would work is if
                   he sabotaged certain freezers
                   on the trip back.  Then he could
                   jettison the bodies and make up
                   any story he liked.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fuuuck!  He's dead.
                          (to Burke)
                   You're dogmeat, pal.

                                  BURKE
                   This is total paranoid delusion.
                   It's pitiful.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (wearily)
                   You know, Burke, I don't know
                   which species is worse.  You don't
                   see them screwing each other over
                   for a fucking percentage.

                                  HICKS
                          (serious)
                   Let's waste him.
                          (to Burke)
                   No offense.

        Ripley shakes her head, the rage giving way to a
        sickened emptiness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Just find someplace to lock him
                   up until it's time to --

        THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  Everyone stops in the sudden darkness,
        realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the
        struggle.  Hicks looks at the board.  Everything is out.
        Doors.  Video screens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They cut the power.

                                  HUDSON
                   What do you mean, they cut the
                   power?  How could they cut the
                   power, man?  They're animals.

        Ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Stay close.
                          (to the others)
                   Let's get some trackers going.
                   Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch
                   Burke.

        Hudson and Vasquez pick up their scanners and move to
        the door.  Vasquez has to slide it open manually on its
        track.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           147

        The two troopers separate and move rapidly to the
        barriers at opposite ends of the control block.

        DOLLYING WITH VASQUEZ as she moves forward with feral
        steps in the darkness.

        ON HUDSON  scanning the med lab and the nearby barrier.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Anything?

        BEEP.  Hudson's tracker lights up, a faint signal.

                                  HUDSON
                   There's something.

        He pans it around.  Back down the corridor.  It beep
        again, louder.

                                  HUDSON
                   It's inside the complex.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (voice over)
                   You're just reading me.

                                  HUDSON
                   No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're
                   inside.  Inside the perimeter.
                   They're in here.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?

        ANGLE ON VASQUEZ  swinging her tracker and rifle together.
        She aims it behind her.  BEEP.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (cool)
                   Hudson may be right.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         148

        Ripley and Hicks share a look..."here we go."

                                  HICKS
                          (low)
                   It's game time.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get back here, both of you.  Fall
                   back to Operations.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           149

        Hudson backtracks nervously, peering all around.  He
        looks stretched to the limit.

                                  HUDSON
                   This signal's weird...must be
                   some interference or something.
                   There's movement all over the
                   place...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Just get back here!

        Hudson reaches the door to operations at a run, a
        moment before Vasquez.  They pull the door shut and
        lock it.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         150

        Hudson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out their
        armament.  Flamethrowers.  Grenades.  M-41A magazines.
        Hudson's tracker beeps.  Then again.  The tone continues
        through the SCENE, its rhythm increasing.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!  Signal's clean.

        He pans the scanner.  Stops.  The range display reads
        out, counting down.

                                  HUDSON
                   Range twenty meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   Seal the door.

        Vasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply.

                                  HUDSON
                   Seventeen meters.

                                  HICKS
                   Let's get these things lit.

        He hands one flamethrower to RIpley and begins priming
        the other himself.  It lights with a muffled POP.
        Ripley's lights a moment later.  Sparks shower around
        Vasquez as she begins welding the door.  Hudson's tracker
        is beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They learned.  They cut the power
                   and avoided the guns.  They must
                   have found another way in, something
                   we missed.

                                  HICKS
                   We didn't miss anything.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fifteen meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, an acid hole in
                   a duct.  Something under the
                   floors, not on the plans.
                   I don't know!

        She picks up Vasquez' scanner and aims it the same
        direction as Hudson's.

                                  HUDSON
                   Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big
                   fucking signal.  Ten meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right on us.  Vasquez,
                   how you doing?

        Vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal
        as she welds the door shut.  Working like a demon.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nine meters.  Eight.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Can't be.  That's inside the room!

                                  HUDSON
                   It's readin' right.  Look!

        Ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.

                                  HICKS
                   Well you're not reading it right!

                                  HUDSON
                   Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

        He looks at Ripley.  It dawns on both of them at the same
        time.  She feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles
        her tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead.  The
        tone gets louder.

        Hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of
        acoustic drop-ceiling.  He shines his light inside.

        HICKS' P.O.V.                                           151

        A soul-wrenching nightmare image.  Moving in the beam of
        light are aliens.  Lots of aliens.  They are crawling
        like bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beams
        of the structural ceiling, not touching the flimsy
        acoustic panels.  They glisten hideously as they claw
        their way forward in silence.  They cover the ceiling
        of the operations room.  The inner sanctum is utterly
        violated.

        ON HICKS                                                152

        blasted by fear.

        Something moves...he snaps the light around.  It's a
        meter behind him.  IT LUNGES!  He drops reflexively,
        the claws raking across his armor.

        Hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach
        en masse from the handholds.  THE CEILING EXPLODES,
        raining debris.  Nightmare shapes drop into the room.
        Newt screams.  Hudson opens fire.  Vasquez grabs Hicks,
        pulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower.
        Ripley scoops up Newt and staggers back.  Gorman turns
        to fire and Burke bolts for the only remaining exit,
        the corridor connecting to the med lab.  In the
        strobelike glare of the pulse-rifles we SEE flashes
        of aliens, moving forward in the smoke from the
        flamethrower fires.  They move like nothing human...
        leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with
        powerful, balletic grace.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Medical!  Get to medical!

        She dashes for the corridor.

        INT. MED LAB CORRIDOR                                   153

        DOLLYING BEHIND HER as she sprints, the walls becoming
        a frenzied blur.  Ahead of her Burke clears the door to
        the med lab.  HE SLIDES IT CLOSED.  Ripley slams into
        the door.  Tries the latch.  Hears it LOCK from the far
        side.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!  Open the door!

                                  NEWT
                   Look!

        Behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a
        locomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and
        inhuman as you can imagine.  Strobe flashes backlight
        the demented silhouette.  Shaking, Ripley raises her
        rifle.  She squeezes the trigger.  NOTHING HAPPENS.
        The creature HISSES, baring its teeth as it advances.
        Ripley checks the SAFETY.  The safety is off.  The
        DIGITAL COUNTER.  The magazine is full.  Newt begins to
        wail.  Ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are trembling
        so much she almost drops the rifle.  Panic screams in
        her brain.  The thing is almost on her, filling the
        corridor, when she remembers.  She snaps the bolt back,
        chambering a round.  Whips the stock to her shoulder.
        FIRES.  FLASH-CRACK!  A FLASHBULB GLIMPSE OF shrieking
        jaws as the silhouette is hurled back, screeching
        insanely.

        Ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil,
        blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         154

        Hicks looks up.  Fires POINT-BLANK at a leaping
        silhouette.  SCREEEECH!  The fire-control system has
        tripped, with sprinklers spraying the room and a
        mindless SIREN wailing.  Total pandemonium.

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Let's go!  Let's go!

                                  HICKS
                   Fuckin' A!

        Hudson screams as floor panels lift under him, and clawed
        arms seize him lightning fast, dragging him down.
        Another skeletal shape leaps on him from above.  He
        disappears into the subfloor crawlway.  Hicks, Vasquez
        and Gorman make it to the med lab access corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR

        Stunned, Ripley sees through dissipating smoke the
        creature rising to advance again.  Flinching against
        blast and glare she drills it POINT-BLANK with a
        BLINDING BURST that carries the M-41A's muzzle right
        up toward the ceiling.  Newt covers her ears against
        the CONCUSSION.

                                  HICKS
                          (o.s.)
                   Hold you fire!

        The troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (indicating door)
                   Locked.

                                  HICKS
                   Stand back.

        Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the
        lock.  Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor.
        Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings
        her rifle.  She starts loading 30mm grenades into the
        launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells.

                                  GORMAN
                   You can't use those in here!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Right.  Fire in the hole!

        She pumps a round up and fires.  The grenade EXPLODES and
        the blast almost knocks them down.  Hicks kicks the door
        open, molten droplets flying.

                                  HICKS
                          (shouting at Vasquez)
                   Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   What?

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      156

        Vasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three
        grenades rapid-fire through the gap.  She slams the door
        home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding
        gonglike through the metal.

        Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door.
        Burke has locked it as well.  Hicks switches his
        hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door
        they just passed through.

        INT. MED LAB                                            157

        Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the
        dark chamber.  Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he
        crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main
        concourse.  His fingers reach for the latch.  It moves
        by itself.  The door opens slowly.

        ON BURKE  his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.  We
        hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      158

        The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating
        slightly from its frame.  Another crash, the squeal of
        tortured steel.  Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and
        tugs her across the room.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on!  This way.

        She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and
        expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open.  Newt
        starts inside but Ripley pulls her back.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Stay behind me.

        Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before
        he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a
        tight fit.  Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks,
        Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard.  Glancing back
        fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl
        rapidly through the shaft.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on.  Crawl faster.

                                  RIPLEY
                   DO you know how to get to the
                   landing field from here?

                                  NEWT
                   Sure.  Go left.

        Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is
        enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch.  She runs,
        scraping her back on the ceiling.  The troopers' armor
        clatters in the confined space.  They approach an
        intersection.  She fires the flamethrower around the
        corner, the looks.  Clear.

                                  NEWT
                   Go right.

        They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze
        becoming a blur.  Ripley fires the flamethrower
        periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by
        louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or
        lower levels.

                                  HICKS
                          (into headset)
                   Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.

        There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost
        unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   Yes, I read you.  Not very well...

        EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD                      159

        Bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry
        mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.

                                  BISHOP
                          (yelling;
                          over enunciating)
                   The ship is on its way.  ETA
                   about sixteen minutes.  I've
                   got my hands full flying...
                   the weather's come up a bit.

        Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and
        he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry
        updates rapidly.

        In the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon,
        wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges.

        INT. AIR DUCT                                           160

                                  HICKS
                   All right, stand by there.  We're
                   on out way.  Over.

        The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the
        tunnel ahead.  She blinks, seeing something...not sure.
        A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the
        tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Back.  Go back!

        They try to crawl back, jamming together.  Behind them,
        the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a
        FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior
        flows into the duct.  They are trapped.  Vasquez uses
        her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire.  Hicks
        snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the
        duct.  Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the
        tunnel with lurid light.  Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (icy)
                   Losing fuel.

        Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees the
        glistening apparitions closing in.  Hicks' torch feathers
        out.  Empty.  Bracing his back he kicks hard at the
        cherry-hot metal.  It bends aside.

        Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and
        conduit.  Hicks slides through the searing hole,
        lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out.
        Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman.  Vasquez'
        flamethrower goes dry.  She draws her SERVICE PISTOL.
        Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM
        A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her.

        She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM!  BAM!  BAM!
        Rolls aside.  It lands on her legs and she snaps her head
        to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the
        metal wall beside her cheek.  She fires again, emptying
        the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away.

        Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into
        her thigh.  She cries out, gritting her teeth against
        the white-hot pain.  Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to
        move.  Sees the creatures coming the other way...and
        turns away from the escape hole.  He crawls back to her,
        grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards
        safety.  Too late.  The approaching alien warriors have
        reached and passed the opening.  Vasquez sees him,
        barely conscious.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (hoarse whisper)
                   You always were an asshole, Gorman.

        She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE
        it as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake...
        something for the chosen few.  Gorman returns the grip.
        He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the
        creatures are upon them.

        INT. SERVICE WAY                                        161

        RUSHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run.
        The service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behind
        them and they stumble with the shock wave.  Newt breaks
        out ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to keep
        up.

                                  NEWT
                   This way.  Come on, we're almost
                   there!

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, wait!

        The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around
        obstacles.  If it wasn't clear before it's clear now
        that we are on her turf, and she's the ace.  Running on
        and on, their breathing loud and echoing...the walls
        a directionless blur.  Newt never hesitates.

        They reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE which
        runs upward at a steep 45 degrees.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  Go up.

        INT. CHUTE                                              162

        Ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the
        top...an exterior vent hood.  The sound of wind booms
        down from above.  Like blowing across a bottle top
        vastly amplified.

        Ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow
        side ribs in the shaft.  She looks down.  The chute
        descends far into the depths, lost in shadow.  She
        starts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks,
        just emerging from the side duct.

                                  NEWT
                   Just up there --

        Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot.  She
        slides...catches herself with one hand.  Ripley reaches
        for her, dropping her light.  The hand-light goes
        skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend,
        and disappears.

        Ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's.
        They miss, inches apart.

                                  NEWT
                   Riiiiipppleee --

        She slips.  Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket.
        AND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT.  With an echoing scream Newt
        plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness.

        MOVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like
        a bobsled ride.  THe shaft pitches left.  Newt bounces,
        sliding halfway up the wall.  The chute forks ahead.
        Newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a
        steeper angle into the depths.  Just disappearing down
        the LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light.

        Ripley looks Hicks in the eye.  And kicks free...sliding
        down the chute after Newt.  Ripley slams her feet into
        the side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent.
        Ripley reaches the "V."  Sees the glow of the light in
        the left fork.  She goes left.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!

        She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it
        has no direction.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Mommy...where are you?

        Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it
        intersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL.  The light
        is lying there, but no Newt.  The echoing wail comes
        again.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Moooommeeee...

        Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering.  Newt's call
        comes again.  Fainter?  She can't tell.  She spins in
        a growing panic, starts the other way.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to her headset)
                   Hicks, get down here.  I need
                   that locator.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        163

        Newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes
        and machines.  It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist.
        She looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating.
        Ripley's voice seems to come from there.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (o.s.)
                   Newt!  Star wherever you are!

        Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     164

        Hicks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locator
        from his belt.  They follow the signal into a lighted
        area where the power apparently was not cut.

                                  HICKS
                   This way.  We're close...

        Following the signal they come to a grating set in the
        floor.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.

        Ripley runs to the grating.  Looking down she sees Newt's
        tearstreaked face.  Newt reaches up.  Her tiny fingers
        wriggle up through the bars of the grate.  Ripley
        squeezes the child's precious fingertips.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Climb down, honey.  We have to
                   cut through this grate.

        Newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cuts
        into the bars with his hand-torch.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        165

        Newt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks
        shower blindingly as Hicks cuts.  She bites her lip,
        trembling.  Cold and terrified.  Silently a glistening
        shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind
        her.  It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form.  Newt
        turns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as the
        shadow engulfs her.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     166

        Ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing.
        She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing
        it down.  Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Ripley
        lunges into the hole with her light.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Newt!

        The surface of the water reflects the beam placidly.
        Newt is gone.  Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is
        "Casey" the doll head.  In sinks slowly, distorting,
        vanishing in darkness.

        Hicks pulls Ripley away from the hole.  She struggles
        furiously, trying to tear out of his grip.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  Noooo!

        He drags her back.  It takes all of his strength.

                                  HICKS
                          (intense)
                   She's gone!  Let's go!

        He sees something moving toward them through a lattice
        of pipes.  Ripley is irrational.  Hysterical.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  No!  She's alive!  We
                   have to --

                                  HICKS
                   All right!  She's alive.  I
                   believe it.  But we gotta get
                   moving!  Now!

        He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the
        end of the tunnel.  Gets her inside, slamming her against
        the back wall.  Hits the button to go to surface level.
        An alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts
        toward them.  The doors are closing.  Not fast enough.
        The creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on
        it.  THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature.  THE
        WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING.  Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK.  It
        spins away, SCREECHING.  Acid sluices between the closing
        doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields
        Ripley with his body.  The lift starts upward.  Hicks'
        fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way
        toward his skin.  Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley
        claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can.  He
        screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm.  He
        shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping
        the smoking pieces to the floor.  Acrid fumes fill the
        air, searing eyes and lungs.  The elevator stops.  The
        doors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hicks
        who is doubled over in agony.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Come on, you can make it.
                   Almost there.

        EXT. LANDING FIELD                                      167

        Drop-ship two descends toward the landing grid,
        side-slipping in hurricane gusts.  Bishop stands, guiding
        it with the portable terminal.  The ship sets down hard.
        Slides sideways.  Stops.  Bishop turns as Ripley and
        Hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building
        behind him.  He goes to them, helping to support Hicks
        and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale.
        Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind.

                                  RIPLEY
                   HOW MUCH TIME?

                                   BISHOP
                   PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!

                                   RIPLEY
                   WE'RE NOT LEAVING!

        The loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship.

        EXT. PROCESSING STATION                                 168

        An infernal engine, roaring out of control.  Steam blasts
        and swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure and
        columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into
        the air.

        We APPROACH, hypnotically.  The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME,
        moving toward the station.  It pivots, hovering in the
        blasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDING
        PLATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a third
        of the way up the enormous structure.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          169

        Ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and
        drops the roll.  She has crudely fastened a M-41A
        assault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower.
        A massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower.  Her
        movements are curt, precise...determined.  She works
        rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other
        gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the
        drop-ship.

        Bishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help
        Hicks dress his injuries.  Hicks is sprawled in a flight
        seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around
        him.  He's out of the game...contorted with pain.

                                  BISHOP
                   Ripley...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She's alive.  They brought her
                   here and you know it.

                                  BISHOP
                   In seventeen minutes this place
                   will be a cloud of vapor the
                   size of Nebraska.

        Ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hands
        flying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, don't let him leave.

                                  HICKS
                          (grimacing with
                          pain)
                   We ain't going anywhere.

        She hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spins
        to the door controls.  The door opens.  Wind and
        machine-thunder blast in.

                                  RIPLEY
                   See you, Hicks.

        Hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face.

                                  HICKS
                   Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.

        Ripley grabs his hand.  They share a moment, albeit
        brief.  Mutual respect in the valley of death.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Ellen.

                                  HICKS
                          (nods with
                          satisfaction)
                   Don't be long, Ellen.

        Ripley runs down the ramp, crossing the platform to the
        open doors of a LARGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  The doors close.

        INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR                                   170

        The elevator descends.  Bars of light move rhythmically
        across her as Ripley stands facing the doors, watching
        the landings go by.  The heat grows more intense.  Pipes
        glowing cherry-red pass by.  Steam hisses and billows.
        The lift clatters in a steady beat.  Hypnotic.

        Ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
        directly over her T-shirt.  Her hair is matted, and
        she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a
        determination that holds the gut-panic in check.

        The elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches
        a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the
        flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the
        bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the
        MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her
        jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling,
        forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't
        know doodley about grenades.

        This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She
        begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her fingers
        slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends.

        The lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a
        bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly,
        the doors open.

        HER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty
        corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow
        VISIBLE here and there.  It seems to have been a descent
        into Dantean Hell.  The air itself vibrates with heat
        distortion.  Couplings groan.  Machinery whines and
        throbs.  Like the beating of a vast heart the pounding
        of massive pumps echoes through the station.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           171

        Ripley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on the
        rifle.  Her eyes dart, straining to penetrate the lethal
        gloom.  Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to
        hers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor.  Ahead
        the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence
        and not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins.
        She enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR,
        taped to the top of her kludge weapon.

        A VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.

                                  VOICE
                   Attention.  Emergency.  All
                   personnel must evacuate
                   immediately.  You now have
                   fourteen minutes to reach
                   minimum safe distance.

        INT. CATACOMB                                           172

        Range and direction read out in rapid-fire alpha-numerics
        on the locator display.

        Ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the
        swirling steam of the alien maze.  She approaches an
        intersecting tunnel.  Flashing emergency lights
        illuminate the insane fresco of the walls.  She spins,
        firing the flamethrower.  Nothing there.  She whirls
        back.  Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized.

        Skeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre
        tormented positions like human insects in amber.
        Steam blasts, blinding her.  The locator signal
        strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low
        passage, turns again.  At each intersection she quickly
        lights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it.
        For the way back.  She has to turn sideways, inching
        through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon
        niches, human bas-relief sealed in resin.

        SUDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER!  A hand.
        She recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in
        the wall.  Carter Burke.

                                  BURKE
                   Ripley...help me.  I can feel
                   it...inside.  Oh, God...it's
                   moving!  Oh gooood...

        She looks at him.  No one deserves this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.

        She hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around
        the spoon, and pulls the primer.  She moves on.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have eleven minutes to
                   reach minimum safe distance.

        Ripley moves ahead.  The locator signals shows she is
        almost there.  A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an
        earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet.  Then
        another.  The whole station seems to shudder.  A SIREN
        begins to wail a demented rhythm.  Following the tracker
        she turns a corner and stops.  The RANGE INDICATOR READS
        ZERO.  She looks down, horrified to see Newt's tracer
        bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel.  All hope
        recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        173

        Newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the
        edge of a cluster of upright OVOID SHAPES...alien
        eggs.  Her eyelids flutter open and she becomes
        aware of her surroundings.  The egg nearest her
        begins to move...opening like an obscene flower at
        its top to reveal something stirring within.  Newt
        stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs
        appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one.  She
        SCREAMS.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          174

        Ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        175

        Newt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn toward
        her.  Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap,
        and FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assault
        rifle.  The flash illuminates the figure of an
        adult warrior, nearby.  It spins, moving straight
        for Ripley.  Firing from the hip she drills it with
        two controlled bursts which catapult it back.  She
        steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN.  Her expression is
        murderous.  AND AGAIN.  It spins onto its back.
        She unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in
        a fireball.  Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearing
        at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the
        child.  She swings her up onto her back.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   I knew you'd come.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, I want you to hang on,
                   now.  Hang on tight.

        Groggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts
        of Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up her
        weapon.  More warriors are moving toward her among
        the eggs.  She fires the flamethrower.  The eggs are
        engulfed.  One of the warriors lunges forward, a
        living fireball.  She blasts it in half with two
        bursts from the M-41A.  Ripley retreats, ducking under
        a glistening cylindrical mass.  A PIERCING SHRIEK
        fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is.

        A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN
        glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black
        insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the
        Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable
        horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two
        powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her
        distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells
        and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended
        from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
        membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
        carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes
        she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside
        the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless
        eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor
        where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by
        DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
        of the "warrior" aliens we have already seen.

        Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She
        fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The
        grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE,
        ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous
        matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes
        berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle.
        Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting
        everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel
        in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones
        vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's
        shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two
        warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on
        her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL
        COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the
        magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home
        and OPENS UP.

        The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.  Ripley
        backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy
        of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one
        long eye-searing expenditure of energy.  Then she
        dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal
        instinct.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          176

        Ripley runs, blindly, with panting intensity verging
        on hysteria.  Impressions crash upon her...the maze
        blurring by, sirens howling, the station rocking with
        explosions, emergency lights flashing, steam blasting,
        red-hot steel hissing.  Reality itself is reduced to
        a concussive series of strobelike instants of
        relentless forward motion.

        She sees one of the flares she dropped and turns.
        Sees another, sprinting toward it as the foundations
        of the world shake.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        177

        Lashing in a frenzy, the QUEEN DETACHES FROM THE EGG
        SAC, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and
        tissue behind it.  SEEN DIMLY THROUGH swirling smoke,
        it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward.

        INT. CATACOMBS - CORRIDOR                               178-
                                                                179

        Ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing
        bursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors at
        indistinct shapes and shadows.  The weapon is empty
        when she reaches the freight elevators.  A mass of
        debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level,
        has demolished the life cage she descended in.  She
        slams the control for the other cage and hears the
        sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its
        slow descent from several levels up.  AN ENRAGED
        SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor.  Ripley sees a
        silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black
        shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE
        QUEEN.  Her last cartridge is reading zeroes.  The
        flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that.
        The grenades are gone.  Ripley drops the weapon and
        looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at
        the approaching FIGURE.  The elevator won't be in time.
        She runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous
        screech beats in her ears.  She scrambles up the
        rungs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                       180

        Ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch, Newt
        clinging to her.  She dives aside as a POWERFUL
        BLACK ARM shoots up through the opening, its
        razor claws slamming into the grille-floor inches
        from her.  Looking down through the grille she
        sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her,
        wet and leering.  She scrambles up, running, as
        the grille-floor lifts and buckles behind her
        with the titanic force of the creature below.
        It hurls itself with insane ferocity against the
        metal, pacing her from below as she runs.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          181

        Ripley reaches an open-grid emergency stairwell and
        sprints upward.  It rocks and shudders with the
        station's death throes.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have two minutes
                   to reach minimum safe
                   distance.

        INT. CORRIDOR - ELEVATORS                               182-
                                                                183

        The lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open.
        The Queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating
        the open lift cage.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          184

        Ripley stumbles, smashing her knees against the
        metals stairs.  As she rises she hears the LIFT
        MOTORS start up.  Looking down through the lattice
        work of the station she sees the life cage start
        ominously upward.  She knows there is only one
        explanation for that.  She runs on, the stairwell
        becoming a crazy whirl around her.

        EXT. LANDING PLATFORM                                   185

        Ripley, with Newt still clinging to her, slams
        through the door opening onto the platform.
        Through wind-whipped streamers of smoke she
        sees...THE SHIP IS GONE.

                                  RIPLEY
                   BISHOP!

        Her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred,
        outrage at the final betrayal.  She scans the sky.
        Nothing.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (hysterical)
                   BISHOP!

        Newt is sobbing.

        The lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW.  Ripley turns,
        backing away from the doors toward the railing.  There
        is no place to run to on the platform.  EXPLOSIONS
        detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs
        swell upward through the machinery.  The platform bucks
        wildly.  Nearby a cooling tower collapses with a
        THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL.  More
        EXPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below.
        Ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops.  The
        safety cage parts.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt; low)
                   Close your eyes, baby.

        The lift doors begin to open.  A glimpse of the
        apparition within.

        ANGLE ON RIPLEY AND NEWT  as the drop-ship RISES RIGHT
        BEHIND THEM, its hovering jets roaring.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have thirty seconds to
                   reach...

        Ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from
        the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship.  A
        TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby,
        slamming the ship sideways.  Its extended landing legs
        foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous
        squeal of metal on metal.

        INT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION                           186-
                                                                187

        Ripley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her.  Begins
        strapping in.  Bishop wrestles with the controls.  The
        landing legs retract, ripping free.  Ripley slams her
        seat harness latches home.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Punch it, Bishop!

        The entire lower level of the station disappears in a
        fireball.  The air vibrates with intense heat waves and
        concussion.  The drop-ship engines fire.  Ripley is
        slammed back in her seat.  The ship vaults out and up,
        Bishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees.
        Ripley and Newt see everything shake into a blur.

        EXT. STRATOSPHERE                                       188

        The drop-ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into
        the clear high night.  Below, the clouds light up from
        beneath from horizon to horizon.

        A SUN HOT DOME OF ENERGY bursts up through the cloud
        layer, WHITING OUT THE FRAME.  The tiny ship is slammed
        by the shockwave, tossed forward...and climbs, scorched
        but functioning, toward the stars.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          189

        Ripley and Newt watch the blinding glare fade away and
        they sit, wide-eyed, trembling, realizing they are
        finally and truly safe.  Newt starts to cry quietly,
        and Ripley strokes her hair.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's
                   over.

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT - LATER               190

        The scorched and battered ship once again sits in its
        drop-bay, steam blasting from cooling vents beside the
        engine.  Rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber
        hypnotically.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          191

        Bishop stands behind Ripley as she kneels beside a
        comatose Hicks.

                                  BISHOP
                   I gave him a shot, for the pain.
                   We'll need to get a stretcher to
                   cart him up to medical.

        Ripley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop down
        the aisle to the loading ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm sorry if I gave you a scare
                   but that platform was just becoming
                   too unstable...

        INT. CARGO LOCK - DROP-SHIP                             192

        Bishop continues as they move down the ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I had to circle and hope things
                   didn't get too rough to take you
                   off.

        Ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp.
        She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You did okay, Bishop.

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, thanks, I --

        He notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the
        ramp next to his shoe.  SSSSSS.  Acid.  SOMETHING BURSTS
        FROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood.
        It is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN.
        Driven right through him from behind.  Bishop thrashes,
        seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is
        slowly lifts him off the deck.  Above them the Queen
        glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic
        mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay.  It blends perfectly
        with the machinery until it begins to emerge.  Seizing
        Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him
        aside, shredded, like a doll.  It descends slowly to the
        deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black
        limbs, dripping acid and rage.  Still smoking where Ripley
        half-fried it.  The Queen is huge, powerful...and very
        pissed off.  It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in
        inhuman geometries.

        Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring
        hypnotized...terrified to break and run.  She lowers Newt
        to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt)
                   Go!

        Newt runs for cover.  The Alien drops to the deck, pivoting
        toward the motion.  Ripley waves her arms, decoying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here!

        Without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her.
        Ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her.
        Its feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her.  She clears
        a door.  Hits the switch.  It WHIRRS closed.  BOOM.  The
        Alien hits a moment later.

        INT. DARK CHAMBER                                       193

        Ripley moves ferret-quick among dark, unrecognizable
        machines.

        VARIOUS ANGLES  VERY TIGHT ON what she is doing...her feet
        going into stirruplike mechanisms.  Velcro straps
        fastened over them.  Fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence.
        Her hand closing on a complex grip-control.  The HUM of
        powerful motors.  The WHINE of hydraulics.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         194

        The Queen turns its attention from the doors to Newt as
        the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike
        service channels which cross the deck.  The channels are
        covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her
        to crawl through.

        INT. CHANNEL                                            195

        Newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the
        Alien appears above, seen through the bars.  A section of
        grille is ripped away behind her.  She scrambles
        desperately.  Another section is ripped away right at her
        heels.  Light pouring in.  The next will be right above
        her.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         196

        The Queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her.
        The parting doors REVEAL an inhuman silhouette standing
        there.

        Ripley steps out, WEARING TWO TONS OF HARDENED STEEL.
        THE POWER LOADER.  Like medieval armor with the power of
        a bulldozer.  She takes a step...the massive foot
        CRASH-CLANGS to the deck.  She takes another, advancing.

        Ripley's expression is one you hope you'll never see...
        Hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her
        child and that primal, murderous rage surges through her
        now, banishing all fear.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get away from her, you bitch!

        The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality and leaps.

        WALLOP!  A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches
        it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall.  It
        rebounds into a massive backhand.  CRASH!  It goes
        backward into heavy loading equipment.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (screaming)
                   Come on!

        The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with
        unbelievable fury.  The battle is joined.

        Claws swipe, tail lashes.  Ripley parries with radical
        swipes of the steel forks.  They circle in a whirling
        blur, demolishing everything in their path.  The cavernous
        chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...WHINE, CRASH,
        CLANG, SCREECH.

        They lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks,
        crushing two of the creature's limbs.  It lashes and
        writhes with incredible fury, coming within inches of her
        exposed body.  She lifts it off the ground.  The hind
        legs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, denting
        it in.  The striking teeth extend almost a meter from
        inside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash-bars.
        She ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion
        behind her dead in a spray of drool.  Yellow acid foams
        down the hydraulic arms toward her.  The creature rips
        at high-pressure hoses.  Purple hydraulic fluid sprays
        ...machine blood mixing with alien blood.  They topple,
        off balance.  The Queen pins her.  Ripley hits a switch.
        The power loader's CUTTING TORCH flares on, directly in
        the thing's face.  They roll together, over the lip of
        a RECTANGULAR PIT, A VERTICAL LOADING AIRLOCK.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       197

        They crash together four meters below, twisted in the
        loader's wreckage.  The Alien shrieks, pinned.

        Ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader
        and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons.
        She slaps the red "INNER DOOR OVERRIDE" and latches the
        "HOLD" locking-key down.  A KLAXON begins to sound.  She
        hits "OUTER DOOR OPEN" and there is a hurricane shriek of
        air as the doors on which they are lying separate,
        REVEALING the infinite pit of stars, below.

        All this time the Alien has been lashing at her in a
        frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the
        confined space.  The airlock becomes a wind tunnel,
        blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap
        from the loader.  The air of the vast ship howls past her
        into space as she claws her way up a service ladder.

        INT. CARGO BAY                                          198

        Newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across
        the floor toward the airlock.   Bishop, torn virtually in
        two, his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind,
        grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for Newt as she
        slides past him.  He catches her arm and hangs on as she
        dangles, doll-like, in the airblast.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       199

        The Alien seizes Ripley's ankle.  She locks her arms
        around a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of
        their shoulder sockets.

        The door opens farther, all of space yawning below.  The
        loader tumbles clear, falling away.  It drags the Alien,
        still clutching one of Ripley's lucky hi-tops, into the
        depths of space.  Its SHRIEK fades, it gone.

        With all her strength Ripley fights the blasting air,
        crawling over the lip of the inner doorway.  She releases
        the OVERRIDE from a second panel.  The inner doors close.
        The turbulent air eddies and settles.

        She lies on her back, drained of all strength.  Gasping
        for breath.  Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bishop
        still holding Newt by the arm.  Encrusted with his own
        vanilla milkshake blood.  Bishop gives her a small, grim
        smile.

                                  BISHOP
                   Not bad for a human.

        He winks.

        Ripley crosses to Newt.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   Mommy...Mommy?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Right here, baby.  Right here.

        Ripley hugs her desperately.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           200

        Ripley limps along the corridor, carrying Newt on her hip.
        The ship's systems hum comfortingly.  Newt's head rests
        on her shoulder.

                                  NEWT
                   Are we going to sleep now?

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.

                                  NEWT
                   Can we dream?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

        HOLD ON THEM AS they recede down the long straight
        corridor.

                                                         FADE OUT

   
                               THE END

                                ALIENS

        FADE IN

        SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE                            1

        Silent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of
        God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip
        of technology.

        CLOSER SHOT  It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the
        ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior
        or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING
        of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow
        engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing
        over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
        toward it.

        INT. NARCISSUS                                            2

        Dark and dormant as a crypt.  The searchlights stream
        in the dusty windows.  Outside, massive metal forms can
        BE SEEN descending around the shuttle.  Like the tolling
        of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through
        the hull.

        CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR  Light glares as a cutting
        torch bursts through the metal.  Sparks shower into the
        room.

        A second torch cuts through.  They move with machine
        precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging.  The
        torches meet.  Cut off.  The door falls inward REVEALING
        a bizarre multi-armed figure.  A ROBOT WELDER.

        FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous.  THREE MEN in
        bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment.  They
        approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.

                                   LEADER
                           (filtered)
                    Internal pressure positive.  Assume
                    nominal hull integrity.  Hypersleep
                    capsules, style circa late twenties...

        His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
        canopy.

        ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE  as light stabs in where the dust is
        wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful
        repose.

        WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo.
        Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.

                                   LEADER
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Lights are green.  She's alive. 
                    Well, there goes out salvage, guys.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION    3 

        She's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female MED-TECH
        raises the backrest.  She is surrounded by arcane white
        MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.  The Med-Tech exudes practiced
        cheeriness.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Why don't I open the viewport?
                    Watch your eyes.

        Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
        the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista.  Beyond the
        sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
        called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
        from high orbit.  Blue and serene.

                                   MED-TECH
                    And how are we today?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (weakly)
                    Terrible.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just terrible?  That's better
                    than yesterday at least.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long have I been on
                    Gateway station?

                                   MED-TECH
                    Just a couple of days.  Do you
                    feel up to a visitor?

        Ripley shrugs, not caring.  The door opens and a MAN
        enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying.
        A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Jones!

        She grabs the cat like a life preserver.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (cooing baby-cat talk)
                    Come here Jonesy you ugly old
                    moose...you ugly thing.

        Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
        seeming none the worse for wear.  The visitor sits
        beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him.  He is
        thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
        or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness.  A
        smile referred to as "winning."

                                   MAN
                    Nice room.  I'm Burke.  Carter Burke.
                    I work for the company, but other
                    than that I'm an okay guy.  Glad to
                    see you're feeling better.  I'm told
                    the weakness and disorientation
                    should pass soon.  Side effects of
                    the unusually long hypersleep, or
                    something like that.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long was I out there?  They
                    won't tell me anything.

                                   BURKE
                           (soothing)
                    Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
                    about that just yet.

        Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How long?

        Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.

                                   BURKE
                    All right.  My instinct says
                    you're strong enough to handle
                    this...Fifty-seven years.

        Ripley is stunned.  She seems to deflate, her expression
        passing through amazement and shock to realization of
        all she has lost.  Friends.  Family.  Her world.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...

                                   BURKE
                    You'd drifted right through the
                    core systems.  It's blind luck that
                    deep-salvage team caught you when
                    they...are you all right?

        Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
        becomes one of dawning horror.  Burke hands her a glass
        of water from the nightstand.  She slaps it away.  It
        shatters with a SMASH.  Jones dives, yowling.  Ripley
        grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.
        The Med-Tech hits a console button.

                                   MED-TECH
                           (shouting)
                    Code Blue!  415.  Code Blue!
                    4-1-5!

        Burke and the Med-Tech are holding Ripley's shoulders as
        she goes into convulsions.  A DOCTOR and TWO TECHS run
        in.  Ripley's back arches in agony.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No...noooo!

        They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
        equipment.  Her EKG races like mad.  Jones, under a
        cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.

                                   DOCTOR
                    Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
                    And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!

        AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
        chest!  Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
        SHEET.  Tearing itself out of her.

        HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises.  A GLIMPSE OF the
        CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
        Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
        breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
        no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
        snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
        her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
        breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.

        A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on.  A MED-TECH's
        face.

                                   MED-TECH
                    Bad dreams again?  Do you want
                    something to help you sleep?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (faint)
                    No.. I've slept enough.

        The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off.  Touching a button
        on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
        Gateway and the turquoise Earth.  She hugs Jones to her
        and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
        nightmare.  Shivering.  Sleep is far off.

                                   RIPLEY
                    We made it, Jones.  We made it.

        But at what price?

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. PARK                                                 4   

        Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars,
        beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE.

        EXTREME F.G.  Jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
        fallen leaves.  He leaps.  And smack into A WALL.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (voice over)
                    Dumbshit.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Jones steps back confused from the
        HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
        cinerama video-loop.  Ripley sits on a bench in what we
        now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
        somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station.  Benches.
        Some unenthusiastic potted trees.  The sterile corridors
        VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.

        Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.

                                   BURKE
                    Sorry...I've been running behind
                    all morning.

        Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Have they located my daughter
                    yet?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, I was going to wait
                    until after the inquest...

        He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
        hard copy, including a telestat photo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Is she...?

                                   BURKE
                           (scanning)
                    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married
                    name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six
                    ...at time of death.  Two years
                    ago.
                           (looks at her)
                    I'm sorry.

        Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.

        The face of a woman in her mid-sixties.  It could be
        anybody.  She tries to reconcile the face with the
        little girl she once knew.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Amy.

                                   BURKE
                           (reading)
                    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't
                    licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred
                    Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
                    Wisconsin.  No children.

        Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
        past.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I promised her I'd be home for
                    her birthday.  Her eleventh
                    birthday.  I sure missed that
                    one.
                           (pause)
                    Well...she has already learned
                    to take my promises with a grain
                    of salt.  When it came to flight
                    schedules, anyway.

        Burke nods, a simpatico presence.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You always think you can make it
                    up to somebody...later, you know.
                    But now I never can.  I never
                    can.

        Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough
        lady.  But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
        this moment, overwhelming.  She cries silently.

        Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.

                                   BURKE
                           (gently)
                   The hearing convenes at 0930.  You
                   don't want to be late.

        INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY                                   5

        Elevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation
        with Burke.  DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You read my deposition...it's
                    complete and accurate.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, I believe you, but there are
                    going to be some heavyweights in
                    there.  You got Feds, you got
                    interstellar commerce commission,
                    you got colonial administration,
                    insurance company guys...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I get the picture.

                                   BURKE
                    Just tell them what happened.  The
                    important thing is to stay cool
                    and unemotional.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY                6

        She's not cool.  Not unemotional.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Do you people have earwax, of
                    what?  We have been here three
                    hours.  How many different ways
                    do you want me to tell the same
                    story?

        She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a
        long conference table.  Gray suits and grim faces.  They
        aren't buying.  Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN,
        PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot.  His
        file prints out next to it.  BRETT's face and dossier
        replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues...
        KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS.
        VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers
        and frowns.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Look at it from our perspective.
                    You freely admit to detonating the
                    engines of, and thereby destroying,
                    an M-Class star-freighter.  A
                    rather expensive piece of hardware...

                                   INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR 
                           (dryly)
                    Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
                    That's minus payload, of course.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The shuttle's flight recorder
                    corroborates some elements of
                    your account.  That the Nostromo
                    set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
                    planet, at that time.  That
                    repairs were made.  That it resumed
                    its course and was subsequently set
                    for self-destruct.  By you.  For
                    reasons unknown.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I told you...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It did not, however, contain any
                    entries concerning the hostile
                    life form you allegedly picked up.

        Ripley sense the noose tightening.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Then somebody's gotten to it...
                    doctored the recorder.  Who had
                    access to it?

        The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
        Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.

                                   ECA REP
                    Would you just listen to yourself
                    for one minute.

        Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous
        side of fifty.  Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    The analysis team which went over
                    your shuttle centimeter by
                    centimeter found no physical
                    evidence of the creature you
                    describe...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (losing it) 
                    That's because I blew it out the
                    Goddamn airlock!
                           (pause)
                    Like I said.

                                   INSURANCE MAN
                           (to ECA Rep)
                    Are there any species like this
                    'hostile organism' on LV-426?

                                   ECA REP
                    No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
                    life larger than a simple virus.

        Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
                    There was an alien spacecraft there.
                    A derelict ship.  We homed on its
                    beacon...

                                   ECA REP
                    To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
                    over three hundred worlds and no one's
                    ever reported a creature which, using
                    your words...
                           (read from Ripley's
                           statement)
                    ...'gestates in a living human host'
                    and has 'concentrated molecular acid
                    for blood.'

        Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
        table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as
        a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I can see where this is
                    going.  But I'm telling you those
                    things exist.  Back on that planetoid
                    is an alien ship and on that ship
                    are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
                    Do you understand?  I suggest you
                    find it, using the flight recorder's
                    data.  Find it and deal with it --
                    before one of your survey teams
                    comes back with a little surprise...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
                    will be...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (louder, stepping
                           on him)
                    ...because just one of those
                    things managed to kill my entire
                    crew, within twelve hours of
                    hatching...

        Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, that will be all.

        Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
                    those things get back here, that
                    will be all.  Then you can just
                    kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
                    it goodbye.

        Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration
        and anger.  Dallas looks back at her from the video
        screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             7

        Ripley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee
        and donuts at a vending machine.

                                   BURKE
                    You had them eating out of your
                    hand, kiddo.

                                   RIPLEY
                    They had their minds made up
                    before I even went in there.
                    They think I'm a head case.

                                   BURKE
                           (cheerfully)
                    You are a head case.  Have a donut.

        INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - LATER            8

        Van Leuwen clears his throat.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    It is the finding of this board of
                    inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,
                    NOC-14672. has acted with questionable
                    judgment and is unfit to hold an
                    ICC license as a commercial flight
                    officer.

        Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lipped
        but subdued.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Said license is hereby suspended
                    indefinitely.  No criminal charges
                    will be filed at this time and you
                    are released on own recognizance
                    for a six month period of
                    psychometric probation, to include
                    monthly review by an ICC psychiatric
                    tech...

        INT. CORRIDOR                                             9

        DOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and
        Ripley strides through.  She shrugs off Burke's
        restraining arm and catches up to Van Leuwen walking
        down the corridor.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (insistent)
                    Why won't you check out LV-426?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                           (condescendingly)
                    Because I don't have to.  The
                    people who live there checked it
                    out years ago and they never
                    reported and 'hostile organism'
                    or alien ship.  And by the way,
                    they call it Acheron now.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What are you talking about.
                    What people?

        Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but
        Ripley holds the door from closing.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Terraformers...planet engineers.
                    It's what we call a shake 'n' bake
                    colony.  They set up atmosphere
                    processors to make the air
                    breathable...big job.  Takes
                    decades.  They've already been
                    there over twenty years.  Peacefully.

        The door tries to close.  Ripley slams it back.  People
        are getting annoyed.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How many colonists?

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Sixty, maybe seventy families.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Sweet Jesus.

                                   ELEVATOR PASSENGER
                    Do you mind?

        Ripley's hand slides off the door, strengthless.

        TIGHT ON HER  FROM INSIDE the elevator as the doors close
        like fate on her lost expression.

        EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY                               10

        A hideous, storm-blasted vista.  Tortured rock forms.
        Bleak twilight at midday.

        PAN SLOWLY ONTO a CORRODED METAL SIGN set in concrete
        pylons, which reads:

                       HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159
                         "WELCOME TO ACHERON"

        Some local has added below in spray-can graffiti
        "Have a nice day."  Gale-force wind SCREECHES around
        the steel sign, driving a freezing rain.

        The COLONY, b.g., is a squat complex with lots of
        floodlights.

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      11

        The town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete
        buildings connected by conduits.  Neon signs throw garish
        colors across the vaultlike walls, advertising bars and
        other businesses.  It looks like a sodden cross between
        the Krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in
        the Nevada boondocks.

        Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted
        "street" and vanish down rampways to underground garages.

        ANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK  the largest structure.  It
        resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft
        carrier...a flying bridge.

        VISIBLE across a half kilometer of barren heath, b.g.,
        is the massive complex of the nearest ATMOSPHERE
        PROCESSOR, looking like a power plant bred with an active
        volcano.  Its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover
        like a steel mill.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK                 12

        A central space, laid out like a scaled-down shopping
        mall with no styling flourishes.  We SEE a cross section
        of the types of people who have come to live on
        Godforsaken Acheron.  Tough.  Pragmatic.  "Grapes of
        Wrath" faces.  Calloused hands.  Not too many interior
        decorators.  Some children race in the corridor on things
        that look suspiciously like "Big Wheels."

        INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK                     13

        Jammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays...
        most of the business of running the colony flows through
        here.  It's high tech but used and scrungy.  Papers
        piled up.  Coffee cup rings.

        DOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, the Assistant Operations Manager,
        as he catches up to the harried Operating Manager,
        SIMPSON.

                                   LYDECKER
                    You remember you sent some
                    wildcatters out to that
                    plateau, out past the Ilium
                    range, a couple days ago?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Yeah.  What?

                                   LYDECKER
                    There's a guy on the horn,
                    mom-and-pop survey team.  Says
                    he's homing on something and
                    wants to know if his claim will
                    be honored.

                                   SIMPSON
                    Christ.  Some honch in a cushy
                    office on Earth says go look at
                    a grid reference in the middle
                    of nowhere, we look.  They don't
                    say why, and I don't ask.  I
                    don't ask because it takes two
                    weeks to get an answer out here
                    and the answer's always 'don't
                    ask.'

                                   LYDECKER
                    So what do I tell this guy?

                                   SIMPSON
                    Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
                    he finds something it's his.

        EXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED     14
        TRACTOR - DAY

        It roars across corrugated rock, blasting through soggy
        drifts of volcanic ash.

        INT. TRACTOR                                             15

        At the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN,
        independent prospector.  Beside him is his wife/partner
        ANNE and in the back their two kids are playing among the
        heavy sampling equipment.

                                   JORDEN
                           (gloating cackle)
                    Look at this fat, juicy magnetic
                    profile.  And it's mine, mine,
                    mine.

                                   ANNE
                    Half mine, dear.

        NEWT, their six-year-old daughter, yells from the back...

                                   NEWT
                    And half mine!

                                   JORDEN
                    I got too many partners.

                                   NEWT
                    Daddy, when are we going back
                    to town?

                                   JORDEN
                    When we get rich, Newt.

                                   NEWT
                    You always say that.  I wanna go
                    back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'

        Her older brother TIM sticks his jeering face close to
        hers.

                                   TIM
                    You cheat too much.

                                   NEWT
                    Do not.  I'm just the best.

                                   TIM
                    Do too!  You go in places we
                    can't fit.

                                   NEWT
                    So!  That's why I'm the best.

                                   ANNE
                    Knock it off!  I catch either of
                    you playing in the air ducts again
                    I'll tan your hides.

                                   NEWT
                    Mom.  All the kids play it...

                                   JORDEN
                           (reverently)
                    Holy shiiit!

        ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY  ON a bizarre shape looming
        ahead.  An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from
        the bed of ash.  The tractor slows.

        Canted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping
        by the lava flow, it is still recognizable as an
        EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP.  Bio-mechanoid.  Nonhuman design.

                                   JORDEN
                    Folks, we have scored big this
                    time.

        EXT. TRACTOR                                             16

        Jorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS.
        Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR.  Their
        breath clouds in the chill air.

                                   ANNE
                    You kids stay inside.  I mean
                    it!  We'll be right back.

        They trudge toward the alien derelict.

                                   ANNE
                    Shouldn't we call in?

                                   JORDEN
                    Let's wait till we know what to
                    call it in as.

                                   ANNE
                           (nervous)
                    How about 'big weird thing'?

        They pause at a twisted gash in the hull.  Blackness
        inside.

        INT./EXT. TRACTOR                                        17

        Newt has her face pressed to the glass, steaming it.
        Watching her parents enter the strange ship.  Tim GRABS
        HER from behind.  She SHRIEKS.

                                   TIM
                    Cheater!

        EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   18

        The tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless.
        The wind HOWLS around them.

        Tim is curled up in the driver's seat.  Newt shakes him
        awake, trying hard not to cry.

                                   NEWT
                    Timmy...they've been gone a
                    long time.

        Tim considers the night.  The wind.  The vast landscape.
        He bites his lip.

                                   TIM
                           (quavering)
                    It'll be okay, Newt.  Dad knows
                    what he's doing.

        CRASH!  Newt SCREAMS as the door beside her is RIPPED
        OPEN.  A dark shape lunges inside!

        Anne, panting and terrified, grabs the dash mike.

                                   ANNE
                    Mayday!  Mayday!  This is
                    Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
                    calling Hadley Control.
                    Repeat.  This is...

        As Anne shouts the mayday Newt looks past her, to the
        ground.  Russ Jorden lies there inert, dragged somehow
        by Anne from inside the ship.  There is SOMETHING ON
        HIS FACE.  An appalling MULTILEGGED CREATURE, pulsing
        with obscene life.  Newt begins to SCREAM hysterically,
        competing with the shrieking wind which rises to a
        crescendo as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY                  20

        Silence.  Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in
        the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from
        her cigarette.  The place is modest, to be charitable,
        and there are few personal touches.  Though it's late
        in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe.  The bed is
        unmade.  Dishes in the sink.  Jones prowls across the
        counter.  The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly.

                                   VOICE FROM VIDEO
                           (o.s.)
                    Hey, Bob!  I heard you and the
                    family are heading off for the

                                   BON
                           (o.s.)
                    Best decision I ever made, Bill.
                    We'll be starting a new life
                    from scratch, in a clean world.
                    No crime.  No unemployment...

        The door BUZZES.  Ripley jumps like a cat.  Jones doesn't.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            21

        Carter Burke stands in the narrow, dingy corridor with
        LIEUTENANT GORMAN, Colonial Marine Corps.  Young and
        severe in his officer's dress-black.  The door opens
        slightly.

                                   BURKE
                    Hi, Ripley.  This is
                    Lieutenant Gorman of the...

        SLAM.  Burke buzzes again.  Talks to the door...

                                   BURKE
                    Ripley we have to talk.
                           (pause) 
                    They've lost contact with the
                    colony on Acheron.

        The door opens.  Ripley considers the ramifications of
        that.  She motions them inside.

        INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER                 22

        Burke and Gorman are seated, nursing coffee.  Ripley
        paces, very tense.

                                   RIPLEY
                    No.  There's no way!

                                   BURKE
                    Hear me out...

                                   RIPLEY
                    I was reamed, steamed and
                    dry-cleaned by you guys...and
                    now you want me to go back out
                    there?  Forget it.

        We SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger.
        Burke sees it.

                                   BURKE
                    Look, we don't know what's going
                    on out there.  It may just be a
                    down transmitter.  But if it's
                    not, I want you there...as an
                    advisor.  That's all.

                                   GORMAN
                    You wouldn't be going in with the
                    troops.  I can guarantee your
                    safety.

                                   BURKE
                    These Colonial Marines are
                    some tough hombres, and they're
                    packing state-of-the-art firepower.
                    Nothing they can't handle...right,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                           (cool)
                    We're trained to deal with these
                    kinds of situations.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (to Burke)
                    What about you?  What's your
                    interest in this?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, the corporation co-financed
                    that colony with the Colonial
                    Administration, against mineral
                    rights.  We're getting into a lot
                    of terraforming...'Building Better
                    Worlds.'

        Burke is revealing his early days in sales.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.

                                   BURKE
                    I heard you were working in the
                    cargo docks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (defensive)
                    That's right.

                                   BURKE
                    Running loaders, forklifts, that
                    sort of thing?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shrugging)
                    It's all I could get.  Anyway,
                    it keeps my mind off of...
                    everything.  Days off are worse.

                                   BURKE
                    What if I said I could get you
                    reinstated as a flight officer?
                    And that the company has agreed
                    to pick up your contract?

                                   RIPLEY
                    If I go.

                                   BURKE
                    If you go.
                           (pause)
                    It's a second chance, kiddo.  And
                    it'll be the best thing in the
                    world for you to face this fear
                    and beat it.  You gotta get back
                    on the horse...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (frosty)
                    Spare me, Burke.  I've had my
                    psych evaluation this month.

        Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.

                                   BURKE
                    Yes, and I've read it.  You
                    wake up every night, sheets
                    soaking, the same nightmare
                    over and over...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    No!  The answer is no.  Now
                    please go.  I'm sorry.  Just
                    go, would you.

        Burke nods to Gorman who rises with him.  He slips a
        TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door.

                                   BURKE
                    Think about it.

        EXT. ACHERON LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                           23

        As the wind HOWLS through tormented rock, BUILDING IN
        PITCH until we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. APARTMENT                                           24

        Ripley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry.  She
        clutches her chest, breathing hard.  Bathed in sweat
        she lights a cigarette with trembling hands.  Do we
        hear a faint, desolate wind?

        TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE  as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's
        card into a slot.  "STAND BY" prints out on the screen
        and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep.

                                   BURKE
                           (on video phone)
                    Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...

                                   RIPLEY
                    Burke, just tell me one thing.
                    That you're going out there to
                    kill them.  Not study.  Not bring
                    back.  Just burn them out...clean
                    ...forever.

                                   BURKE
                    That's the plan.  My word on it.

        CLOSEUP - RIPLEY  taking a deep slow breath.  It's time
        to look the demon in the eye.

                                   RIPLEY
                    All right.  I'm in.

        She punches off before Burke replies, before she can
        change her mind.  She turns to Jones sitting on the
        bed and her tone becomes admonishing...

                                   RIPLEY
                    And you my dear, are staying
                    right here.

        Jones blinks, cynical cat eyes..."count me right
        out."

                                                        CUT TO:

        EXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER                      25

        An empty starfield.  Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME.

        A mountain of steel following.  A massive military
        transport ship, the SULACO.  Ugly, battered...
        functional.

        INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK                              26

        An empty corridor, seemingly miles long.  No movement.
        The THRUMMING of hyperdrive engines.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                          27

        An enormous chamber, cavernous and dark.  Squatting
        in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface shuttles.
        DROP-SHIPS.  Heavy machinery all around them...
        cranes, loading equipment.

        INT. BRIDGE                                              28

        Dark electronic womb.  CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY among
        murmuring instrumentation.  A sudden high-pitched
        TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights.  An alarm.

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    29

        Blackness, until a bank of indicators lights up.
        Hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of
        horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS.  It reaches the
        ceiling.  Locks.

        CLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE  as trickles of water run
        down the frosted canopy.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

        INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT                                    30

        Lit up, white and sterile.

        The canopies of the row of capsules are raised.  Ripley
        sits up.  Rubs her arms briskly.  Next to her Gorman
        and Burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers,
        wearing shorts and dog tags.  They are:

           MASTER SERGEANT APONE                    UNIT LEADER

           CORPORAL HICKS                         B-TEAM LEADER

           CORPORAL DIETRICH (female)                  MED-TECH

           PFC HUDSON                                  COM-TECH 
           
           PFC VASQUEZ (female)            'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE DRAKE                   'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR

           PRIVATE FROST                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE CROWE                                TROOPER

           PRIVATE WIERZBOWSKI                          TROOPER

           CORPORAL FERRO (female)              DROP-SHIP PILOT

           PFC SPUNKMEYER                   DROP-SHIP CREW CHIEF

        The ship is fully automated in interstellar flight so
        there is no crew, except for EXECUTIVE OFFICER (ECA) Bishop,
        who supervises planetary maneuvering.

        GROANS echo across the chamber.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Arrgh.  I'm getting too old for
                    this shit.

        SPUNKMEYER says this sincerely, though he must have
        enlisted underage not long ago.  Looking surly, DRAKE
        sits up.  He's young as well but street-tough.  Nasty
        scar curling his lip into a sneer.

                                   DRAKE
                    They ain't payin' us enough
                    for this.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Not enough to have to wake up
                    to your face, Drake.

                                   DRAKE
                    Suck air.  Hey, Hicks...you look
                    like I feel.

        HICKS, an older lifer-type who keeps his own counsel,
        just snorts good-naturedly.

        Ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a
        bank of lockers.  Though not supermen they are lean and
        hardened...tough, capable, jaded.  They combine the
        specialized techno-combat training of the twenty-first
        century fighting man with those qualities universal to
        "grunts" through the ages.  SERGEANT APONE moves down the
        row of freezers.

                                   HUDSON
                    This floor's freezing.

                                   APONE
                    Christ.  I never saw such a
                    buncha old women.  You want me
                    to fetch your slippers, Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    Would you, Sir?

        Ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding
        cursory hellos.  She feels isolated by the camaraderie
        of this tightknit group.

        VASQUEZ eyes her coldly as she passes.  Like Drake,
        Vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat-primer
        was the street in a Los Angeles barrio.  She is tough
        even by the standards of this group.  Hard-muscled.
        Eyes cunning and mean.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, Vasquez...you ever been
                    mistaken for a man?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    No.  Have you?

        She slaps Drake's open palm and it clenches into a
        greeting which is part contest.  It gets rougher.
        Painful.  Until she cuffs him hard and they break with
        vicious laughter.  Dobermans playing.  Conscripted from
        juvenile prison, the two of them were trained to
        operate the formidable "SMART-GUNS."  That is part
        of their bond.

        BISHOP is helping everyone like a valet.  As he passes
        close to her Ripley notices a strange TATTOO across
        the back of his left hand...an ALPHA-NUMERIC CODE.

                                   FROST
                    Hey, hand job, you take my
                    towel?

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                           (overlapping)
                    I need some slack, man.  How
                    come they send us straight back
                    out like this?  We got some slack
                    comin', man.

                                   HICKS
                    You just got three weeks.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    I mean breathing, not this frozen
                    shit.

                                   DIETRICH
                    Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?

                                   APONE
                    You know it ain't up to me.
                           (louder)
                    Awright!  Let's knock off the
                    grabass.  First assembly's in
                    fifteen...let's shag it.

        INT. SHOWERS                                             31

        High pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when
        you step out...a drive through car wash for people.
        Through the swirling steam Hudson, Vasquez and FERRO
        are watching Ripley dry off.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Who's the fresh meat again?

                                   FERRO
                    She's supposed to be some kinda
                    consultant...
                    (exaggerated)
                    ...She was an alien once.

                                   HUDSON
                    Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.

        INT. MESS HALL                                           32

        An unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers
        assemble at one long table while Gorman, Burke, Bishop
        and Ripley sit at another.  Everybody is nursing a
        coffee, waiting for eggs from the AUTOCHEF.  Among the
        troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized
        and emblazoned with patches.  Drake's tunic is cut off
        to a vest and has "Eat the apple and fuck the Corps"
        stenciled on back.  "Peace Through Superior Firepower,"
        "Pray for War" and "I've Served My Time in Hell:  Cetti
        Epsilon NC-104" are some others.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?

                                   APONE
                    Rescue mission.  There's some
                    juicy colonists' daughters we
                    gotta rescue from virginity.

        Apone is stocky, grizzled, with peregrine eyes.  He runs
        it loose and fair, but only because he knows his people
        are the best.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Shee-it.  Dumbass colonists.
                    What's this crap supposed to be?

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Cornbread, I think.  Hey, I wouldn't
                    mind getting me some more a
                    that Arcturan poontang.  Remember
                    that time?

                                   HICKS
                           (low)
                    Looks like that new Lieutenant's
                    too good to eat with us grunts.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                           (glancing
                           over shoulder)
                    Yeah.  Got a corn cob up his ass,
                    definitely.

        Across the room, at the other table, Gorman sits with
        his creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO.  Bishop
        takes a seat beside Ripley, who pointedly gets up and
        moves to the far side of the table.  He looks wounded.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm sorry you feel that way
                    about Synthetics, Ripley.

        Ripley spins on Burke, her tone accusing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    You never said anything about an
                    android being here!  Why not?

                                   BURKE
                    Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's
                    been policy for years to have a
                    synthetic on board.

                                   BISHOP
                    I prefer the term 'artificial person'
                    myself.  Is there a problem?

                                   BURKE
                    A synthetic malfunctioned on her
                    last trip out.  Some deaths were
                    involved.

                                   BISHOP
                    I'm shocked.  Was it an older model?

                                   BURKE
                    Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.

        Bishop turns to Ripley, very conciliatory.

                                   BISHOP
                    Well, that explains it.  The
                    A/2's were always a bit twitchy.
                    That could never happen now with
                    out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible
                    for me to harm or, by omission of
                    action, allow to be harmed a
                    human being.
                           (smiling)
                    More cornbread?

        WHAM!  Ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway
        across the room.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Just stay away from me, Bishop!
                    You got that straight?

        Burke and Gorman exchange glances.

        Wierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back
        to the other troopers.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    She don't like the cornbread
                    either.

                    Tench-hut!

        WIDER ANGLE  as the troops snap to from their lounging
        among the racks of high-tech weaponry.  Gorman enters
        with Burke and Ripley.

                                   GORMAN
                    At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't
                    have time to brief before we
                    left Gateway but...

                                   HUDSON
                    Sir?

                                   GORMAN
                           (annoyed)
                    Yes, Hicks?

                                   HUDSON
                    Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.

                                   GORMAN
                    What's the question?

                                   HUDSON
                    Is this going to be a stand-up
                    fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?

                                   GORMAN
                    All we know is that there's
                    still no contact with the colony
                    and that a xenomorph may be
                    involved.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    A what?

                                   HICKS
                           (to Wierzbowski;
                           low)
                    It's a bug-hunt.
                           (louder)
                    So what are these things?

        Gorman nods to Ripley, who stands before the troops.
        She sets some RECORDING DISKETTES on the table.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I've dictated what I know on
                    these.

                                   APONE
                    Tease us a bit.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Yeah...previews.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Okay.  It's important to understand
                    this organism's life cycle.  It's
                    actually two creatures.  The first
                    form hatches from a spore...a sort
                    of large egg, and attaches itself
                    to its victim.  Then it injects
                    an embryo, detaches and dies.
                    It's essentially a walking sex organ.
                    The --

                                   HUDSON
                    Sounds like you, Hicks.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (controlled)
                    The embryo, the second form, hosts
                    in the victim's body for several
                    hours.  Gestating.  Then it...
                           (with difficulty)
                    ...then it...emerges.  Moults.
                    Grows rapidly --

                                   VASQUEZ
                    I only need to know one thing.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Yes?

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Where they are.

        Vasquez coolly points her finger, cocks her thumbs, and
        blows away an imaginary alien.

                                   DRAKE
                    Yo!  Vasquez.  Kick ass!

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   HUDSON
                    Somebody said alien...she
                    thought they said illegal alien
                    and signed up.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Fuck you.

                                   HUDSON
                    Anytime.  Anywhere.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (icy)
                    Am I disturbing you conversation
                    Mr. Hudson?

        Hudson settles down, smirking.  Ripley locks eyes with
        Vasquez.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I hope you're right.  I really
                    do.

                                   BURKE
                           (to all)
                    I suggest you study the disks
                    Ripley has been kind enough to
                    prepare for you.

                                   GORMAN
                    Are there any questions?  Hudson?

                                   HUDSON
                    How do I get out of this
                    chicken-shit outfit?

        Gorman scowls then, thanking Ripley with a nod, takes
        over the predrop briefing.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right.  I want this to go
                    smooth and by the numbers.  I
                    want DCS and tactical database
                    assimilation by 0830.
                            (some groans)

        They have arrived.  From orbit the planet looks serene
        ...Pearlescent cloud cover masking the environmental
        torment beneath.  The SULACO floats, its MANEUVERING
        JETS FIRING.  A bluish glow.  Then twice more, rapidly.

        sliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing
        CLANG.  PULL BACK as the rack of tactical missiles is
        lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms.

        Spunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the
        ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where
        it locks into place.  As he exerts pressure with his
        hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms
        move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase
        in power.  The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can
        crush with tons of pressure.  The loader has an open
        ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported
        by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly
        with the driver's movements.

        You have never seen anything like this before.
        Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift
        to them...battered and well used.  Covered with grease.
        Repainted many times.  Across the back is stencilled
        "CATERPILLAR."

        Spunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop-ship
        and we become aware of the intense activity throughout
        the cavernous loading bay.  Troopers on foot or driving
        TOW-MOWERS, OVERHEAD LOADING ARMS...all in motion.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 37

        Wierzbowski, Drake and Vasquez are fieldstripping
        light weapons with precise movements.  Around them,
        in racks, is an arsenal of advanced personal
        artillery.

        Vasquez likes the feel of the guns, the weight...the
        authority.  Her hands move without hesitation.  CLACK.
        CLACK.  CLACK.  She swings one of the SMART-GUNS out
        on a work stand.  Using a body brace and GYRO-STABILIZED
        SUPPORT ARM, it is a computer-aimed, video targeted
        automatic weapon.  The futuristic equivalent of a .30
        caliber light machine gun.  Sort of a steadicam that
        kills.

        INT. LOADING BAY - ANGLE ON BURKE AND GORMAN             38

                    Still nothing from the colony?

                                   GORMAN
                    Dead on all channels.

        Ripley watches the drop-ship being loaded.  A cross
        between a Huey Aircobra gunship and the space shuttle
        might describe it.  An orbit-to-surface troop carrier,
        heavily armed for the close support of ground missions.
        She watches a six-wheeled APC, ARMORED PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, being raised hydraulically into the ship's
        belly.  Ripley looks around as Frost wheels a rack of
        incomprehensible equipment toward her.

                                   FROST
                    Clear, please.

        Ripley jumps aside, nodding apologetically.  She turns.
        Steps hastily back.  Hudson cruises by with a laden
        forklift.

                                   HUDSON
                    Excuse me.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I feel like a fifth wheel
                    here.  Is there anything I can
                    do?

                                   APONE
                    I don't know.  Is there anything
                    you can do?

                                   RIPLEY
                           (pointing)
                    I can drive that loader.  I've
                    got a Class Two rating.  My
                    latest career move.

        Apone turns.  A SECOND POWER LOADER sits unused in
        an equipment bay.

        TWO SHOT APONE AND HICKS  skeptical.  Considering.

        TIGHT ON POWER SWITCH  as Ripley's finger punches it on.
        A RISING WHINE of power.

        TIGHT ON THE HYDRAULICS  as the massive machine stirs
        to life.

        FULL, as the loader starts.  Ripley is strapped into
        the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the
        servo-sensor assemblies.  She takes a step.  BOOM!
        Two tons of hardened steel takes a step.

        Ripley spins the wrist servos.  The huge claws swing,
        open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a
        cargo module, nearby.  She raises it deftly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Where you want it?

        Hicks looks at Apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively.

        INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY                                 39

        The troopers are suiting up for the drop.  Strapping on
        their bulky COMBAT-ARMOR...interlocking plates like
        football padding.  They tape their wrists.  Draw on
        segmented boots.  The sole cleats CLACK like hooves
        on the deck plates.  Lockers SLAM.

        WEB BELTS.  PACKS.  HARNESSES.  HELMETS.  COM-SETS.
        Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings.
        It has its own rhythm...CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.

                                   APONE
                    Let's move it, girls!  On
                    the ready line.  Let's go,
                    let's go.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     40

        Ripley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into
        the ship with the hulking troopers.  Inside they pass
        directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take
        seats facing each other across a narrow aisle.  They will
        drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for
        rapid deployment.  A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling
        depressurization of the cargo lock.

        Hudson prowls the aisle, his movements predatory and
        exaggerated.  Ripley watches him working his way toward
        her.

                                   HUDSON
                    I am ready, man.  Ready to get
                    it on.  Check-it-out.  I am the
                    ultimate badass...state of the
                    badass art.  You do not want to
                    fuck with me.  Hey, Ripley, don't
                    worry.  Me and my squad of
                    ultimate badasses will protect you.
                    Check-it-out...

        He slaps the SERVO-CANNON controls in the GUN BAY
        above them.

                                   HUDSON
                    Independently targetting
                    particle-beam phalanx.  VWAP!
                    Fry half a city with this puppy.
                    We got tactical smart-missles,
                    phased-plasma pulse-rifles,
                    RPG's.  We got sonic eeelectronic
                    ballbreakers, we got nukes, we
                    got knives...sharp sticks --

        Hicks grabs Hudson by his battle harness and pulls him
        into a seat.  His voice is low, but it carries.

                                   HICKS
                    Save it.

                                   HUDSON
                    Sure, Hicks.

        Ripley nods her thanks to Hicks.  MOTORS WHINE and the
        craft lurches.  Burke, next to Ripley, grins eagerly
        like this is a sport fishing trip.

                                   BURKE
                    Here we go.

        She looks like she's in a gas chamber waiting for the
        pellet to drop.

        EXT. SULACO                                              41

        The drop-ship lowers from the cargo-lock on a massive
        launch rig.  The night side of Acheron yawns below...
        enigmatic.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             42

        Ferro and Spunkmeyer run rapidly through the switches.

                                   FERRO
                    Initiate release sequencer on my
                    mark.  Three.  Two.  One.  Mark!

        EXT. SULACO - DROP-SHIP                                  43

        Hydraulic WHINE.  Clamps SLAM BACK.  The ship drops.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     44

        Apone, stalking the aisle, snatches for a handhold.
        Bishop, Burke and Gorman groan at the sudden gees.
        Ripley closes her eyes...the point of no return.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           45

        It screams down through the stratosphere, plunging
        into dark turbulence.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             46

        Beyond the canopy is gray limbo.  The craft shudders
        and lurches.

                                   FERRO
                           (icy calm)
                    Switching to DCS ranging.

                                   SPUNKMEYER
                    Two-four-o.  Nominal to profile.
                    Picking up some hull ionization.

                                   FERRO
                    Got it.  Rough air ahead.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          47

        TIGHT ON HICKS  asleep in his harness.

                                   FERRO
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Stand by for some chop.

        TIGHT ON GORMAN  as the ship begins to buck, his eyes
        closed.  Pale.  Sweating.  He rubs his hands on his
        knees repeatedly.

                                   RIPLEY
                    How may drops is this for you,
                    Lieutenant?

                                   GORMAN
                    Thirty-eight...simulated.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    How many combat drops?

                                   GORMAN
                    Well...two.  Three, including
                    this one.

        Vasquez and Drake exchange do-you-believe-this-shit
        expressions.  Ripley looks accusingly at Burke.

        INT. COCKPIT                                             48

                                   FERRO
                    Turning on final.  Coming around to
                    a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal
                    guidance locked in.  Where's
                    the damn beacon?

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                           49

        It emerges from the low cloud ceiling.  From the twilight
        haze ahead the distant colony LANDING BEACONS become
        visible.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          50

        Stumbling as the ship pitches, Ripley makes her way
        forward to the MOBILE TACTICAL OPERATIONS BAY (MTOB),
        a control console lined with monitor screens.  She
        joins Burke watching over Gorman's shoulder as the
        Lieutenant plays the board like a video director.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR CONSOLE  REVEALING screens labelled with
        the names of the troopers.  Two for each soldier.  The
        upper screens show images from the IMAGE-INTENSIFIED
        VIDEO CAMERAS in their helmets.  The lower screens are
        BIO-MONITORS:  EEG, EKG, and other graphic life-function
        readouts.  Other screens show EXTERIOR VIEWS.

                                   GORMAN
                    Let's see.  Everybody on line.
                    Drake, check you camera.  There
                    seems to be a...

        CLOSE ON DRAKE  as he whacks himself on the head with
        an ammo case.  A familiar malfunction.

                                   GORMAN
                           (o.s)
                    ...that's better.  Pan it around
                    a bit.

                                   APONE
                    Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up.
                    Let's move.  Two minutes.
                    Somebody wake up Hicks.

        A clatter of activity as they don backpacks and weapons.
        Vasquez and Drake buckle on their smart-gun body
        harnesses.

        Ripley watches the AP station loom on the exterior
        screens.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That the atmosphere processor?

                                   BURKE
                    Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so,
                    all over the planet.  They're
                    completely automated.  We
                    manufacture them, by the way.

        EXT. SHIP - AP STATION                                   51

        The tiny ship circles the roaring tower.  A metal
        volcano thundering like the engines on God's Lear jet.

        INT. HOLD - APC                                          52

        Gorman plays with the controls, zooming the image of
        the colony.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Hold at forty.  Slow circle of
                    the complex.

                                   RIPLEY                                   
                    The structure seems intact.  They
                    have power.

        On the screen the colony buildings loom in and the low
        visibility like wrecks of freighters on the sea floor.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Apone)
                    Okay, let's do it.

                                   APONE
                    Awright!  I want a nice clean
                    dispersal this time.

        Ripley turns as Vasquez squeezes past her.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You staying in here?

                                   RIPLEY
                    You bet.

                                   VASQUEZ
                           (turning away)
                    Figures.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Ferro via mike)
                    Set down sixty meters this side
                    of the telemetry mast.  Immediate
                    dust off on my 'clear,' then stay
                    on station.

                                   APONE
                    Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      53

        Landing beacons sweep harsh light across the wet Tarmac.
        The ship roars down, extending the loading ramp.  Slams
        down on hydraulic LANDING LEGS.  The APC hits the ground
        a moment later, pulling away from the ship as it leaps
        up in a cloud of spray and peels off, circling.

        The APC pulls to the edge of the complex.  The CREW DOOR
        opens.  Troopers hit the ground running.  Spread out.
        They drop behind immediate cover.  Apone scans with
        him image intensifier visor lowered.

        APONE'S P.O.V.  through the starlight-scope visor.
        Bright as a sunny day, though contrasty and lurid, we
        SEE the colony buildings.  Trash blows in the street.
        No other movement.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    First squad up, on line.  Hicks,
                    get yours in a cordon.  Watch the
                    rear.

                                   APONE
                    Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.

        Sprinting in a skirmish line, Apone's team advances on
        the colony main entry-lock.  Parked tightly across the
        doors are two heavy-duty tractors.  Vasquez reaches one
        of the tractors, looks inside.  The controls are ripped
        out, as if by a crowbar or axe.  She moves on.

        EXT. COLONY BUILDING                                     54

        Vasquez reaches the main doors, Drake flanking on the
        right.  Apone tries the door controls.  Nothing.

                                   APONE
                    Sealed.  Hudson, run a bypass.

        Hudson, all business now, moves up and studies the
        door control panel.  He pries off the facing and starts
        clipping on the bypass wires.

                                   APONE
                    First squad, assemble on me at
                    the main lock.

        The wind roars around the bleak structures.  A neon sign
        creaks overhead.  Hudson makes a connection.  The door
        shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside.  It jams
        partway open.  Apone motions Vasquez inside.  She
        eases over the wrecked tractor, through the doors.
        The others follow.

                                   GORMAN
                           (voice over;
                           filtered)
                    Second team, move up.
                    Flanking positions.

        INT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE                             55

        DOLLYING SLOWLY FORWARD, following Vasquez and Apone as
        they move into the broad corridor.  A few emergency
        lights are still on.  Wind moans along the concourse.
        Pools of water cover the floor.  Farther down, rain drips
        through blast holes in the ceiling.  Evidence of a
        fire fight with pulse-rifles.

        ON VASQUEZ  moving forward.  Taut.  Alert.  Her smart-gun
        cannon swinging slowly in an arc.  She studies the
        video aiming monitor, looking down rather than ahead.
        Their footsteps echo.

        INT. APC                                                 56

        Ripley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty
        colony building.

                                   GORMAN
                    Quarter and search by twos.  Second
                    team move inside.  Hicks, take the
                    upper level.  Use your motion
                    trackers.

        INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - SECOND LEVEL                       57

        Hicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level.
        They emerge cautiously.  An empty corridor recedes into
        the dim distance.  Hicks unslings a rugged piece of
        equipment.  Aims it down the hall.  He adjusts the
        "gain."  It remains silent.

                                   HICKS
                    Nothing.  No movement.

        They pass rooms and offices.  Through doors they see
        increasing signs of struggle.  Furniture overturned.
        Papers scattered...floating sodden in the puddles.

        INT. APC                                                 58

        Ripley et al watching.

                                   BURKE
                    Looks like my room in college.

        Nobody laughs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                        59

        Hicks' group passes several burnt-out rooms.  There are
        no bodies.  In several offices the exterior windows are
        blown out, admitting wind and rain.  Hicks picks up a
        half-eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with
        rainwater.

        INT. LOWER LEVEL - QUARTERS                              60

        Apone's men are searching systematically in pairs.  They
        pass through the colonists' modest apartments, little
        more than cubicles.  Hudson, on tracker, flanks Vasquez
        as they move forward.  Hudson touches a splash of color
        on the wall.  Dried blood.  His tracker BEEPS.

        Vasquez whirls, cannon aimed.  The BEEPING grows more
        frequent as Hudson advances toward a half open door.  The
        door is splintered partway out of its frame.  Holes
        caused by pulse-rifle rounds pepper the walls.  Vasquez
        eases up to the door.  Kicks it in.  Tenses to fire.

        Inside, dangling from a piece of flex conduit, a
        junction-box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a
        broken window.  It clanks against the rails of a child's
        bunkbed as it swings.

        INT. DROP-SHIP - APC                                     61

        Ripley watches Hicks' monitor.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Wait!  Tell him to...
                           (plugs in
                           headset jack)
                    ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left.
                    There!

        TIGHT ON MONITOR  as the image shifts, revealing a
        section of wall corroded almost through in an irregular
        pattern.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  knowing what it is.

                                   HICKS

                   You seeing this okay?  Looks
                   melted.

        Burke raises an eyebrow at Ripley.

                                   BURKE
                    Hmm.  Acid for blood.

                    Looks like somebody bagged them
                    one of Ripley's bad guys here.

        INT. FIRST LEVEL                                         62

        Hudson is looking at something.

                                   HUDSON
                    Hey, if you like that, you're gonna
                    love this...

        WIDER ANGLE  showing the trooper standing beneath a
        gaping hole.  Another hole, directly beneath, is at his
        feet.  The acid has melted right down through two levels
        into the maintenance level.  Revealing pipes, conduit,
        equipment...eaten away by the ferocious substance.

                                   APONE
                    Second squad?  What's your status?

        INT. APC                                                 63

        Gorman turns to the others.

                                   GORMAN
                    All right, the area's secured.
                    Let's go in and see what their
                    computer can tell us.

                    the south lock by the up-link

                           (cupping his mike)
                    He's coming in.  I feel safer
                    already.

                                   VASQUEZ

        EXT. COLONY COMPLEX                                      65

        Lights arc across the dormant buildings as the APC turns
        onto the "main drag."  It trundles down the rutted
        street, throwing up sheets of filthy water as the
        massive wheels hit pondlike potholes.  Windblown rain
        lashes across the headlights.

        Hicks emerges from the south lock just as the APC rolls
        up close to the entrance.  The crew-door slides back.
        Gorman emerges, followed by Burke, Bishop, and
        Wierzbowski.  Burke looks back to see Ripley stop in the
        APC doorway, eyeing the ominous colony structure.  She
        meets his eyes.  Shakes her head "no."  Not ready.

                                   HUDSON
                           (voice over;

                    Okay, stand by in operations.
                           (to those present)
                    Let's go.

        INT. APC                                                 66

        The crew-door cycles home with a clang.  Ripley sits in
        the dark interior, lit by the tactical displays.  The
        wind howls outside, an incredibly desolate sound.  She
        hugs herself.  Alone.  Unarmed.  She knows she's in a
        tank, but remembers the acid.  Leaps up.  Hits the door
        switch.

        EXT. APC - SOUTH LOCK                                    67

        The crew-door opens and Ripley emerges.  In time to see
        the lock doors rumbling closed.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (shouting)
                    Burke!

        The wind snatches her words away.  The crew door whines
        shut behind her.  She walks to the exterior lock
        door-controls and studies them.  She punches some
        unfamiliar buttons.  Nothing happens.  She looks really
        nervous, alone in the howling wind.  She hits another
        button.  The door-motors come to life and she relaxes
        a little.  Glances behind her.  AND SCREAMS!  There's
        a face right there!  Right at her shoulder.  She jumps
        back, gasping for breath.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Scare you?

                                   RIPLEY
                    Christ, Wierzbowski!

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Sorry.  Hicks said to keep an
                    eye on you.

        He gestures for her to precede him inside.

        INT. CONTROL BLOCK CORRIDOR                              68

        Ripley catches up with the others as they move into the
        bowels of the complex.

                                   GORMAN
                           (to Burke)
                    Looks like you company can write
                    off its share of this colony.

                                   BURKE
                           (unconcerned)
                    It's insured.

        ON RIPLEY  as they move along the corridor...reacting to
        the fact that she is back in alien country.  She sees
        the ravaged administration complex.  Fire-gutted offices.
        Hicks notices her looking around nervously.  He motions
        to big Wierzbowski with his eyes and the trooper casually
        falls in beside her on the other side, rifle at ready.
        a two-man protective cordon.  She glances at Hicks.  He
        winks, but so fast maybe it's something in his eye.

        Trooper Frost emerges from a side corridor ahead.

                                   FRONT
                    Sir, you should check this out...

        He leads the way into the corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            69

        This wing is completely without power.  The troopers
        switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate
        a scene of devastation worse than they have seen.  Her
        expression reveals that Ripley is about to turn and flee.

                                   FROST
                    Right ahead here...

        They approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a
        hastily welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door
        panels.  Acid holes have slashed through the floor and
        walls in several places.  The metal is scratched and
        twisted by hideously powerful forces, peeled back like
        a soup can on one side.  They squeeze through the
        opening.

        INT. MEDICAL WING                                        70

        They pack-lights play over the devastation of the
        colonists' last ditch battle.  The equipment of the med
        labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier.  The walls
        are perforated by pulse-rifle fire and acid.  Scorched
        by untended fires to bare metal.  A few instruments glow
        with emergency power.

                                   WIERZBOWSKI
                    Last stand.

                                   GORMAN
                    No bodies?

                                   FROST
                    No, Sir.  Looks like it was a
                    helluva fight.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  transfixed by something.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (low)
                    Over there.

        The others turn and approach, seeing what she sees.  She
        has entered a second room, part of the med lab area.  In
        a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven
        transparent cylinders.  STASIS TUBES.  They glow faintly
        with an eerie violet light given off by the field which
        preserves the specimens inside.

        They look like jars containing SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS,
        the palsied fingers curled in a death-rictus.
        Structurally they are more like spiders with sickening
        translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill-like
        organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid.
        Something you definitely do not want on your face, for
        example.

                                   BURKE
                    Are these the same...?

        Ripley nods, unable to speak.  Burke leans closer in
        fascination.  His face almost touching one cylinder, is
        lit by its glow.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Watch it, Burke...

        The creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against
        the glass.  Burke jumps back.  From the palm of the
        thing's handlike body emerges a pearl-escent TUBULE.
        like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers
        tonguelike over the inside of the glass.  Then it
        retracts into a sheath between the "gills."

                                   HICKS
                           (to Burke)
                    It likes you.

        Only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life.
        Burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the
        hand-things remain inertly clenched.

                                   BURKE
                    These are dead.  There's just
                    the two alive.

        On top of each cylinder is a file folder.  Ripley takes
        a folder from above one of the live specimens.  Inside
        is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (reading)

                    implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk,
                    John L.   Died during procedure.
                           (looking up)
                    They killed him getting it off.

                                   HICKS
                    Poor bastard.

        They are startled by a LOUD BEEP.  They turn.  Hicks
        is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the
        shattered barricade.  BEEP.  BEEP.

                                   HICKS
                    Behind us.

        He gestures at the corridor they just passed through.

                                   RIPLEY
                    One of us?

                                   GORMAN
                           (into headset)
                    Apone...where are your people?
                    Anybody in D-Block?

                                   APONE
                           (voice over; filtered)
                    Negative.  We're all in Operations.

        Vasquez swings the smart-gun to ready position on
        its support arm, locking it with an authoritative
        CLICK.  She and Hicks head toward the source of the
        signal, the others following.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                            71

        Hicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly.  They
        turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth.

        Ripley hangs back.  Then realizes there is nothing
        behind her but darkness.  She catches up to the group.

        INT. KITCHENS                                            72

        The troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the
        stainless steel surfaces.

                                   HICKS
                    It's moving.

        Vasquez is scanning, gaze intense.  The other troops
        grip their weapons tightly.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    Which way?

        Hicks nods toward a complicated array of food
        processing equipment.  They move forward, weapons
        leveled.

        Ripley shuffles forward in the dark.  Wierzbowski
        trips over a metal cannister, sending it CLANGING.
        Ripley half climbs the wall.

        Hicks' tracker beeps steadily.  The beeps merge.
        Become a solid tone.  CRASH.  Something moves in the
        dark, toppling a rack of stockpots.

        ON VASQUEZ  pivoting smoothly to fire.  In the same
        instant Hicks' rifle slashes INTO FRAME.  Slams
        Vasquez' barrel upward.  A STREAM OF TRACER FIRE rips
        into the ceiling, the rounds SEARING LIKE LIGHTNING.

                                   VASQUEZ
                    You fuck!

        Hicks ignores her, moving past and aiming his light
        under a row of steel cabinets.  He gestures to Ripley,
        who steps forward.  Trusting his judgment.  She
        crouches beside him.

        RIPLEY'S P.O.V.  lit by Hicks' pack-light...a tiny
        cowering figure.  A very dirty, very terrified
        NEWT JORDEN.  She clutches a plastic food packet in
        one hand, its top gnawed partway through.  In the other
        hand she grips the HEAD OF A LARGE DOLL, holding it by
        the hair.  Just the head.  Eyes staring.  Newt is
        pathetically emaciated...fragile-looking as Dresden
        china, her hair tangled and matted.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothingly)
                    Come on out.  It's all right...

        Ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the
        cabinet.  Newt backs away, trembling visibly, her
        vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights.
        Ripley's hand almost reaches her.

        The kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the
        cabinetry.  Ripley scrambles to follow...to keep her
        in sight.  Crabbing frantically sideways.  Hicks makes
        a grab, catching one tiny ankle.  He snaps his hand
        out a moment later.

                                   HICKS
                    Ow!  Shit.  Watchit, she bites.

        The girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the
        baseboard, its grille kicked out.  She scrambles
        inside, her tiny body barely fitting, wriggling like
        a fish.

        In his bulky armor Hicks knows he'll never make it
        into the tiny duct.  Ripley dives.  She squirms into
        the duct without thinking.  Just ahead she sees Newt
        enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch.  Ripley
        pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it,
        and crawls in after her.

        Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel
        chamber.  Ripley shines her light around in amazement.
        It is a NEST.  A nest built by a child.  Wadded up
        blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a
        haphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP
        JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even a
        battery operated TAPE PLAYER.  All foraged from the
        wrecked colony.  Ripley marvels at the child's
        incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even
        in this nightmarish environment.

        Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch.

        Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug.  The
        kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets.  Eyes
        wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent.  No
        scream.

                                   RIPLEY
                    It's okay, it's okay.  It's over...
                    you're going to be all right now...
                    it's okay...you're safe...

        Newt goes limp, almost catatonic.

        CLOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE  her lips
        are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and
        she flinches from unseen terrors.  We READ a dark
        nightmare world in her eyes.

        Ripley's light falls on something amidst the debris...
        a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Newt, dressed up and smiling,
        a ribbon in her hair.  In embossed gold letters
        underneath it says:

                      FIRST GRADE CITIZENSHIP AWARD

        sitting huddles in a chair, arms around her knees.
        Looking at a point in space.

        WIDER ANGLE  REVEALING Gorman sitting in front of her
        while Dietrich watches the readouts from a
        BIO-MONITORING CUFF wrapped around Newt's tiny arm.

                                   GORMAN
                    Now think, Rebecca.
                    Concentrate.  Just start at
                    the beginning...

        No response.  Ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.

                                   GORMAN
                    Where are your parents?  You
                    have to try...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (sharply)
                    Gorman!  Give it a rest would
                    you.

        Gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.

                                   GORMAN
                    Total brain-lock.

                                   DIETRICH
                           (shrugs)
                    Physically she's okay.
                    Borderline malnutrition, but
                    I don't think any permanent
                    damage.

        She unsnaps the bio-monitoring cuff.

                                   GORMAN
                    Come on, we're wasting our
                    time.

        Gorman and the others exit, leaving only Ripley with
        Newt.  Through the window of the office, out on the
        main floor of the operations room, we SEE Gorman
        join Burke and Bishop at a computer terminal.

        Ripley kneels beside Newt, brushing the girl's unkempt
        hair out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Here, try this.  A little
                    instant hot chocolate.

        She wraps the child's hands around the cup.  Raises
        it to her lips for her.  The girl drinks mechanically,
        spilling down her chin.

                                   RIPLEY
                           (soothing)
                    Poor thing.  You don't talk
                    much do you?  That's okay by
                    me.  Most people do a lot of
                    talking and they wind up not
                    saying very much.

        She sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Uh oh.  I made a clean spot
                    here.  Now I've done it.  Guess
                    I'll just have to do the whole
                    thing.

        She pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small
        cloth and gently washes the little girl's face.
        Newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Hard to believe...there's a
                    little girl under all this.
                    And a pretty one at that.

        Newt gazes at her.  Ripley smiles.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                          74

        The ground teams are gathered around a terminal in
        the computer center.  Hudson has the CPU main computer
        on-line and reading out.

        TIGHT ON MONITOR SCREEN  as an abstract of the main

        INT. OFFICE                                              75

        Ripley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth,
        pink skin emerging from black grime.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I don't know how you managed
                    to stay alive but you're one
                    brave kid, Rebecca.

        Newt's voice is almost inaudible.

                                   NEWT
                    N-newt.

        Ripley leans closer.  Feels like she's breathing
        on coals.  The sound was incomprehensible.

                                   RIPLEY
                    What did you say?

                                   NEWT
                    Newt.  My n-name's Newt.
                    Nobody calls me Rebecca except
                    my dork brother.

        Ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak...
        or break the spell.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, Newt it is then.  My
                   name's Ripley...and people
                   call me Ripley.

        Ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it
        formally.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Pleased to meet you.  And who
                   is this?  Does she have a
                   name?

        Newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched
        in one filthy hand.

                                  NEWT
                   Casey.  She's my only friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about me?

        Newt's reply is flat, neutral.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want you for a friend.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

                                  NEWT 
                   Because you'll be gone soon,
                   like the others.  Like
                   everybody.  You'll be dead
                   and you'll leave me alone.

        Ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous
        statement and by the situation which could have
        produced this outlook in a child.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad
                   went away like that, didn't
                   they?
        
        Newt nods, staring at her knees.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (soothingly)
                   They'd be here if they could,
                   honey.  I know they would.

                                  NEWT
                          (with cold certainty)
                   They're dead.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I
                   won't leave you.  I promise.

                                  NEWT
                   You promise?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Cross my heart.

                                  NEWT
                   And hope to die?

        Ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre
        expression.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   And hope to die.

        And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even
        the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished
        by a smile and a single promise.

        Newt's eyes brim as she gazes at Ripley.  Her lower
        lip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deforms
        into an abject mask.  She sobs as she clamps her arms
        around Ripley's neck.  The sobs come in waves as
        Ripley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror and
        grief and hurt rolling down her face.  It is a
        breakthrough.

        Ripley closes her eyes, hoping that this promise
        can be kept.

        Everyone jumps as Hudson cries out triumphantly.

        EXT. ACHERON - TWILIGHT                                  77

        The APC roars across the stygian landscape, traversing
        the causeway which connects the colony to the
        ATMOSPHERE STATION a kilometer away.  Behind it the
        drop-ship settles to the ground at the colony landing
        field.

        PAN WITH THE APC TO REVEAL the massive structure.
        Like a vast foundry the conical exhaust tower
        flickers with spectral light.

        INT. APC                                                 78

        The troopers sit, more subdued now, swaying and
        bouncing in the heavily sprung vehicle.  Wierzbowski
        is in the saddle.  Ripley and Newt sit side by side
        just aft of the driver's cockpit.

                                  NEWT
                   I was the best at the game.
                   I knew the whole maze.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The 'maze'?  You mean the
                   air ducts?

                                  NEWT
                   Yeah, you know.  In the walls,
                   under the floor.  I was the
                   ace.  I could hide better
                   than anybody.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're really something, ace.

        Ripley's gaze shifts out the windshield as the
        processing station looms ahead.

        EXT. APC/STATION                                         79

        The vast structure towers above the parked personnel
        carrier.  Deploying in front of the APC, backlit by
        its lights, the troopers cast long shadows.  They
        look ominous.  Hulking techno-samurai.

        The base of the station is a depthless maze of
        conduits and pressure vessels, like an oil refinery.
        Or a Dantean version of one.  The THRUM of
        functioning machine systems echoes through the
        labyrinth.

        The troopers start down the open rampway.  Light
        filters down through several levels of steel mesh
        floor, catwalks and pipes.  Below that is darkness.

        Huddles around the screens are Ripley, Burke and
        Gorman.  Newt squeezes in from behind.  Gorman is
        doing his video wizard bit, dancing on the buttons.

                   We're not making that out too
                   well.  What is it?

                          (voice over; static)
                   You tell me.  I only work
                   here.

        INT. COMPLEX                                             81

        The group stands before a bizarre tableau.  Among
        the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits
        something new and not of human design had been
        added.

        It is a structure of some sort, extending from and
        crudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but made
        of some strange encrusted substance.  It vaguely
        resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much
        larger scale, and it attenuates so gradually into
        the original hardware that it is hard to see where
        one ends and the other begins.

        The alien structure seems to extend far back into
        the complex of machinery.  The plant thrums loudly,
        its functioning seemingly not impaired.

        INT. APC                                                 82

        Ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination.

                                  GORMAN
                   What is it?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know.

                                  GORMAN
                          (to team)
                   Proceed inside.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     83

        They enter the organic labyrinth, playing their
        lights over the walls.  Revealing a BIO-MECHANICAL
        LATTICE, like the marrow of some vast bone.  The air
        is thick with STEAM.  Trickling water.  The place
        seems almost alive.

        INT. APC                                                 84

        They watch in various helmet-camera P.O.V.'s of the
        wall detail.

        CLOSE ON VIDEO  as it PAN SLOWLY...REVEALING a
        bas-relief of detritus from the colony:  furniture,
        wiring, human bones, skulls...Fused together with a
        translucent, epoxylike substance.

                          (voice over; static)
                   Looks like some sort of secreted
                   resin.

                   They ripped apart the colony
                   for building materials.

                   And the colonists...When they

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     85

        Steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper
        inside.

                                  FROST
                   Hotter'n hell in here.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah...but it's a dry
                   heat.

        INT. APC                                                 86

        Ripley leans forward suddenly, studying the graphic
        readout of the STATION GROUND PLAN.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right under the
                   primary heat exchangers.

                                  BURKE
                   Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like
                   the heat, that's why they built...

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's not what I mean.  Gorman,
                   if your men have to use their
                   weapons in there, they'll rupture
                   the cooling system.

                                  BURKE
                          (realizing)
                   She's right.

                                  GORMAN
                   So.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So...then the fusion
                   containment shuts down.

                                  GORMAN
                          (impatient)
                   So?  So?

                                  BURKE
                   We're talking thermonuclear
                   explosion.

                                  GORMAN
                   Shit.

                          mike)
                   Apone, collect magazines
                   from everybody.  We can't
                   have any firing in there.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                     87

        The troopers look at each other in dismay.

                                  WIERZBOWSKI
                   Is he fucking crazy?

                                  HUDSON
                   What're we supposed to use,
                   man?  Harsh language?

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Flame-units only.  I want
                   rifles slung.

                                  APONE
                   Let's go.  Pull 'em out.

        He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines
        from each one's weapon.

        Vasquez turns hers over reluctantly.

        The three who are carrying them get out small
        incinerator units.  When Apone moves on, Vasquez
        slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts
        it in her weapon.  Drake does the same.  Hicks hangs
        back in the shadows.  He opens a cylindrical sheath
        attached to his battle-harness.  Slides out an
        old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt
        stock.  Chambers a round.

                                  HICKS
                          (low,
                          to Hudson)
                   I always keep this handy.
                   For close encounter.

                                  APONE
                          (o.s.)
                   Let's move.  Hicks, back
                   us up.

        INT. LARGER CHAMBER                                      88

        The air is thick.  Lights flare.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over;
                          very faint)
                   Any movement?

        Hudson watches his tracker, scanning.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nothing.  Zip.

        Apone stops, his expression changing.  They face a
        wall of living horror.  The colonists have been
        brought here and entombed alive...

        COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices
        of the structure.  The cocoon material is the same
        translucent epoxy.  The bodies are frozen in
        carelessly twisted positions.  Macabre image of
        frozen agony.  Many are disiccated.  Skeletal.
        Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within.
        Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death
        as hosts for the embryos growing within then.

        Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures,
        perhaps the most "recent."  A WOMAN, ghost-white
        and drained.  The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...They
        seem to plead.

                                  DIETRICH
                   Sir!

        The woman's lips move feebly.

                                  WOMAN
                   Please...God...kill me.

        INT. APC                                                 89

        Ripley watches the woman, white knuckled.  The
        sound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      90

        The woman begins to convulse.  She SCREAMS, a
        sawing shriek of mindless agony.

                                  APONE
                   Flame thrower!  Move!

        Frost hands it to him.  Suddenly, the woman's chest
        EXPLODES in a gout of blood.  A SMALL FANGED HEAD
        EMERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY.

        Apone pulls the trigger.  Then the other troopers
        carrying flame throwers open fire.  An orgy of
        purging fire.  The cocoons vanish in the shimmering
        heat.

        A SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made from
        fingernails on blackboards.

        ANGLE ON WALL  as something begins to emerge.  Dimly
        glimpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature larger
        then a man.  Lying dormant, it had blended perfectly
        with the convoluted surface of fused bone.  The
        troopers don't see it.  Smoke from the burning cocoons
        quickly fills the confined space.  Visibility drops
        to zero.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!

                                  APONE

                                  HUDSON
                   Can't lock up...

                                  APONE
                          (with an edge)
                   Talk to me, Hudson.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, seems to be in front
                   and behind.

        INT. APC                                                 91

        Gorman is plating with the gain controls on the
        monitors.

                                  GORMAN
                   We can't see anything back
                   here, Apone.  What's going on?

        Ripley senses it coming, like a wave at night.  Dark,
        terrifying and inevitable.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (low)
                   Pull you team out, Gorman.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER - TIGHT ON SEVERAL WALLS AND         92
        CEILING NICHES

        as they come alive.  Bonelike, tubelike shapes shift,
        becoming emerging ALIENS.  Dimly glimpsed...glints
        of slime.  Silhouettes.

                                  APONE
                   Go to infrared.  Looks sharp
                   people!

        The squad members snap down their image-intersifier
        visors.

                                  HUDSON
                   Multiple signals.  All round.
                   Closing.

        Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower held
        tightly.  A nightmarish silhouette materializes out
        of the smoke behind her!  It strikes like lightning.
        SEIZES HER.  She fires reflexively, wild.  The jet
        of flame engulfs Frost nearby.

        Apone spins as the double SCREAM.  Can't see anything
        in the think smoke.

        INT. APC                                                 93

        Ripley watches Frost's monitor go black.  His
        bio-readouts flatten.  The other screens show glimpses
        of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens, the
        images bobbing and panning confusedly.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      94

        Vasquez nods to Drake with grim satisfaction.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Let's rock.

        They OPEN UP simultaneously, lighting up the smoke
        like welders' arcs.

                                  GORMAN
                          (voice over; static)
                   Who's firing?  I ordered a
                   hold fire, dammit!

        Vasquez rips off her headset.  She is riveted to the
        targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting
        dance.  Thunder and lightning.  Better than sex for
        her.  FLASH-CRACK!  An alien SCREECH from the darkness.

        INT. APC                                                 95

        The battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens.
        Ripley flinches as another scream comes over the
        open frequency.  Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up.
        His life signs plummet.  Voices blend and overlap.

        Gorman is ashen.  Confused.  Gulping for air like a
        grouper.  How could the situation have unravelled
        so fast?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Gorman)
                   GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO

                                  GORMAN
                   Shut up.  Just shut up!

        CRASH!  Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was
        pulled.  Flat line.

                                  GORMAN
                   Uh,...Apone, I want you to
                   lay down a suppressing fire
                   with the incinerators and
                   fall back by squads to the

                   Say again?  All after
                   incinerators?

        Ripley watches it fall apart.

                                  GORMAN
                   I said...

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      96

        Apone adjusts his headset.

                   ...lay down (garbled) ...by
                   squads to...(garbled)

        Gorman's voice breaks up completely.  A SCREAM.
        Apone whirls, uncertain.

                                  APONE
                   Dietrich?  Crowe?  Sound
                   off!  Wierzbowski?

        Nothing.  He spins.  Almost blows Hudson's head
        off.

                                  HUDSON
                          (freaked)
                   We're getting juked!  We're
                   gonna die in here!

        Apone hands him a magazine.  Hudson slaps it home,
        looking truly terrified.

                                  APONE
                   Yeah.  Right.  Right!  Fuck
                   the heat exchanger!

        He FIRES.  Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a
        horrendous field of fire.  Strobe-bright flashes
        sear the darkness.  She pivots, firing mechanically
        in controlled bursts.  Scoring points in her own
        private video game.

        She SPINS as Hicks approached laterally.  WHAM!  She
        fires "at" him.  Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish
        figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by
        Vasquez' blast.

        INT. APC                                                 97

        Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK.

                                  GORMAN
                          (distantly)
                   I told them to fall back...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (viciously)
                   They're but off!  Do something!

        But he's gone.  Total brain-lock.

        TIGHT ON RIPLEY  as she struggles with a decision.
        She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to
        do.  But more than that, she's furious.  Shouldering
        past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the
        APC.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (in passing)
                   Newt, put your seatbelt on!

        Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC.  Takes
        a deep breath.  Starts slapping switches.

                                  GORMAN
                   Ripley, what the hell...?

        She slams the tractor into gear.

        EXT. APC                                                 98

        as the drive-wheels spin on the wet ground.  The
        massive machine leaps forward.

        INT. APC                                                 99

        Ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead
        as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway.
        She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators
        viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot.
        Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning
        his command center.

                                  GORMAN
                          (shrill)
                   What are you doing?  Turn
                   around!  That's an order!

        He claws at her, hysterical.  Burke pulls him off.

        INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE                                    100

        The APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing
        away outcroppings of alien-encrustation.  Ripley hits
        the floodlights.  Strobe-beacon.  Siren.  She homes
        on the flash of weapons fire ahead.

        INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                     101

        The APC crashes inside, showering debris.  Hicks,
        supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke.
        The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door
        open.

        Drake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as
        they fall back.

        Drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his
        smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower.

        Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and
        drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all.  She sees
        a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake.  She fires one burst,
        prone.  Clean body hit.

        The flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing
        open the thing's thorax.  A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW
        ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating
        into him like a hot knife through butter.  He drops
        in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame
        thrower.

        The jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls,
        engulfing the back half of the APC.

        INT. APC                                                102

        Vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots
        through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire.
        Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges,
        clawing out the opening.  He stops her, dragging her
        inside.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Drake!  He's down!

        Hicks screams right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   He's gone!  Forget it, he's
                   gone!

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (irrational)
                   No.. No, he's not.  He's --

        Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Ripley)
                   Let's go!

        Ripley jams reverse.  Nails the throttle.  The APC
        bellows backward up the ramp.  Hudson disappears
        under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks
        free.  Hicks gets the door almost closed.  Suddenly
        CLAWS appear at the edge.  Newt screams.  Against
        the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez
        the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE.
        Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman.

                                  HICKS
                   Get on the Goddamn door!

        Gorman backs away, eyes wide.  Hicks jams his shoulder
        against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise
        his 12-gauge.  An alien head wedges through the opening,
        its hideous mouth opening.  And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN
        MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger!  BLAM!
        The creature is flung backward, its shattered head
        fountaining acid blood.  The spray eats into the door,
        the deck, hits Hudson on the arm.  He shrieks.  They
        slide the door home and dog it tight.

        EXT. APC                                                103

        The armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp.  Slams
        into a mass of conduit.  Tears free.  Ripley works the
        shifters, pivoting the massive machine.  Everybody's
        shouting, trying to put out the fire.  Pandemonium.

        INT./EXT. APC                                           104-
                                                                105

        Something lands on the roof with a metallic clang.

        Gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far
        from the door as possible.  A latch lever behind his
        head turns.  The small hatch against which he was
        leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out
        the opening  He disappears to the waist with a shriek,
        legs kicking.  The alien clings to the roof, pulling
        him out.  Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and
        buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder.
        Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE
        and turns it rapidly.  On the roof the alien looks up
        as servo-motors whir.  A remote control turret cannon,
        a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc.
        VOOM.  The creature is blasted off the vehicle's
        armored back and tumbles away.  Gorman, slumped
        unconscious, is dragged back inside.

        The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for
        clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet.
        Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews,
        broadsiding a control-room out-building.  Office
        furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in
        the APC's wake.

        Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of
        Ripley's face.  It smashes the windshield.  Glistening,
        hideous jaws lunge inside...

        Ripley recoils.  Face to face once again with the same
        mind-numbing horror.  She reacts instinctively.  Slams
        both sets of brakes with all her strength.  The huge
        wheels lock.  The creature flips off, landing in the
        headlights.  Ripley hits full throttle.  The APC roars
        forward, smashing over the abomination.  Its skeletal
        body is crushed under the massive wheels.  It rolls,
        tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine
        thunders onto the causeway and away from the station.

        A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming
        from the APC's rear end.  Hicks eases Ripley's hand
        back on the throttle lever.  Her grip is white knuckled.

                                  HICKS
                   It's okay...we're clear.  We're
                   clear.  Ease up.

        The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she
        slows the machine.

                                  HICKS
                   Sounds like a blown transaxle.
                   You're just grinding metal.

        EXT. APC                                                106

        The tractor limps to a halt.  A HALF-KILOMETER from the
        atmosphere processing station.  The APC is a smoking,
        acid-scarred mess.

        INT. APC                                                107

        Ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins
        out of her seat into the aisle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt?  Where's Newt?

        Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down.  Newt
        is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat
        and a bulkhead.  She is trembling, and looks terrified,
        but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You okay?

        Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic.  Ripley goes
        back to the others.  Hudson is holding his arm and
        staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all
        back in his mind.

                                  HUDSON
                   Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe
                   it.

        Burke tries to have a look at Hudson's arm.

                                  HUDSON
                          (jerking away)
                   I'm all right, leave it!

        Ripley joins Hicks who is bent over Gorman, checking
        for a pulse.

                                  HICKS
                   He's alive.  I think he's paralyzed.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   He's fucking dead!

        She grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly,
        ready to pulp him with her other fist.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (to Gorman)
                   Wake up pendejo!  I'm gonna kill
                   you, you useless fuck!

        Hicks pushes her back.  Right in her face.

                                  HICKS
                   Hold it.  Hold it.  Back off, right
                   now.

        Vasquez releases Gorman.  His head smacks the deck.
        Ripley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless
        purple puncture wound.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Looks like it stung him.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and
                   Dietrich aren't dead, man.

        They turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointing
        at the bio-function screens.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be like Gorman.  Their
                   signs are real low but they ain't
                   dead!

        Hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around
        the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them
        as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just
        at the edges of their minds.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You can't help them.  Right now
                   they're being cocooned just like
                   the others.

                                  HUDSON
                          (sagging)
                   Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't
                   happening.

        Ripley and Vasquez lock eyes.  Ripley doesn't want
        it to be "I told you so" but Vasquez reads it that
        way.  She turns away with a snap.

        INT. MED LAB                                            108

        Bishop is hunched over an occular probe doing a
        dissection of one of the dead parasites.  Spunkmeyer
        enters with some electronics gear on a hand truck
        and parks it near Bishop's work table.

                                  SPUNKMEYER
                   Need anything else?

        Bishop waves "no" without looking up.

        EXT. COLONY - DROP-SHIP                                 109

        Spunkmeyer emerges, crossing the Tarmac to the loading
        ramp of the ship.  As he nears the top of the ramp,
        his boot slips...skidding on something wet.  Kneeling,
        he touches a small puddle of thick slime.  He shrugs,
        and hits the controls to retract the ramp and close
        the doors.

        INT. APC                                                110

        ON VASQUEZ  wired and intense.

                                  VASQUEZ
                   All right, we can't blow the fuck
                   out of them...why not roll some
                   canisters of CN-20 down there.
                   Nerve gas the whole nest?

                                  HUDSON
                   Look, man, let's just bug out and
                   call it even, okay?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   No good.  How do we know it'll
                   effect their biochemistry?  I say
                   we take off and nuke the entire
                   site from orbit.  It's the only
                   way to be sure.

                                  BURKE
                   Now hold on a second.  I'm not
                   authorizing that action.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Why not?

        Burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals
        flawlessly into conciliatory mode.

                                  BURKE
                   Well, I mean...I know this is an
                   emotional moment, but let's not
                   make snap judgments.  Let's move
                   cautiously.  First, this physical
                   installation had a substantial
                   dollar value attached to it --

                                  RIPLEY
                   They can bill me.  I got a tab
                   running.  What's second?

                                  BURKE
                   This is clearly an important
                   species we're dealing with here.
                   We can't just arbitrarily
                   exterminate them --

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bullshit!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe you haven't been keeping up
                   on current events, but we just got
                   out asses kicked, pal!

        Ripley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, Burke.  We had an agreement.

        Burke moves in, lowering his voice.  He takes her aside
        from the others.

                                  BURKE
                   I know, I know, but we're dealing
                   with changing scenarios here.  This
                   thing is major, Ripley.  I mean
                   really major.  You gotta go with
                   its energy.  Since you are the
                   representative of the company who
                   discovered this species your
                   percentage will naturally be
                   some serious, serious money.

        Ripley stares at his like he's a particularly
        disagreeable fungus.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You son of a bitch.

                                  BURKE
                          (hardening)
                   Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks
                   has authority here.

                                  BURKE
                   Corporal Hicks!?

                                  RIPLEY
                   This operation is under military
                   jurisdiction and Hicks is next in
                   chain of command.  Right?

                                  HICKS
                   Looks that way.

        Burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.

                                  BURKE
                   Look, this is a multimillion
                   dollar operation.  He can't make
                   that kind of decision.  He's just
                   a grunt!
                          (glances at Hicks)
                   No offense.

                                  HICKS
                          (coolly)
                   None taken.
                          (into mike)
                   Ferro, you copying?

                                  FERRO
                          (voice over; static)
                   Standing by.

                                  HICKS
                   Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna
                   need an immediate evac.
                          (to Burke)
                   I think we'll take off and nuke
                   the site from orbit.  It's the
                   only way to be sure.

        He winks.  Burke looks like a kid whose toy has been
        snatched.

                                  BURKE
                   This is absurd!  You don't have
                   the authority to --

        CLACK!  The sound of a rifle bolt snapping home
        truncates his rant.  Vasquez has a pulse-rifle cradled,
        not exactly aimed at Burke but not exactly aimed away
        either.  Her expression is masklike.  End of discussion.

        Ripley sits behind Newt, putting her arm around her.

                                  RIPLEY
                   We're going home, honey.

        EXT. DROP-SHIP                                          111

        The ship rises through the spray thrown up by the
        downblast of the VTOL jets, hovering above the complex
        like a huge insect, its searchlights blazing.

        EXT. APC                                                112

        The group is filing out of the personnel carrier, which
        is clearly a write off.  Hicks and Hudson have Gorman
        between them, and the others emerge into the wind.
        They watch the ship roar in on its final approach.

        INT. DROP-SHOP COCKPIT                                  113

        Ferro flicks the intercom switch several times.  Thumps
        her headset mike.

                                  FERRO
                   Spunkmeyer?  Goddammit.

        The compartment door behind her slides slowly back.

                                  FERRO
                          (turning)
                   Where the fu --

        Her eyes widen.  It's not Spunkmeyer.

        Am impression of leering jaws which blur forward, then
        a whirl of motion and a truncated scream.  The throttle
        levers are slammed forward in the melee.

        EXT. APC - LANDSCAPE - STATION                          114

        They watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and
        VEERS WILDLY.  Its main engines ROAR FULL ON and the
        craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude.
        It skims the ground.  Clips a rock formation.  The
        ship slews, sideslipping.  It hits a ridge.  Tumbles,
        bursting into flame, breaking up.  It arcs into the
        air, end over end, a Catherine wheel juggernaut.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Run!

        She grabs Newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling
        section of the ship's massive engine module slams
        into the APC and it explodes into twisted wreckage.

        The drop-ship skips again, like a stone, engulfed in
        flames...AND CRASHES INTO THE STATION.  A TREMENDOUS
        FIREBALL.

        The remainder of the ground team watches their hopes
        of getting off the planet, and most of their superior
        fire power, reduced to flaming debris.

        There is a moment of stunned silence, then...

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Well that's great!  That's just
                   fucking great, man.  Now what the
                   fuck are we supposed to do, man?
                   We're in some real pretty shit now!

                                  HICKS
                   Are you finished?
                          (to Ripley)
                   You okay?

        She nods.  She can't disguise her stricken expression
        when she looks at Newt, but the little girl seems
        relatively calm.  She shrugs with fatalistic acceptance.

                                  NEWT
                   I guess we're not leaving, right?

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'm sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   You don't have to be sorry.  It
                   wasn't your fault.

                                  HUDSON
                          (kicking rocks)
                   Just tell me what the fuck we're
                   supposed to do now.  What're we
                   gonna do now?

                                  BURKE
                          (annoyed)
                   May be could build a fire and
                   sing songs.

                                  NEWT
                   We should get back, 'cause it'll
                   be dark soon.  They come mostly
                   at night.  Mostly.

        Ripley follows Newt's look to the AP station looming
        in the twilight, the burning drop-ship wreckage jammed
        into its basal structure.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK - NIGHT                              115

        The wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings,
        dry and cold.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         116

        The weary and demoralized group is gathered to take
        stock of their grim options.  Vasquez and Hudson are
        just setting down a scorched and dented packing case,
        one of several culled from the APC wreckage.

        Hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons,
        lying on a table.

                                  HICKS
                   This is all we could salvage.  We've
                   got four pulse-rifles with about
                   fifty rounds each.  Not so good.
                   About fifteen M-40 grenades and
                   two flame throwers less than
                   half full...one damaged.  And
                   We've got four of these
                   robot-sentry units with scanners
                   and display intact.

        He opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a
        high-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optical
        sensing equipment, packed in foam.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long after we're declared
                   overdue can we expect a rescue?

                                  HICKS
                   About seventeen days.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, we're not going to make it
                   seventeen hours!  Those things
                   are going to come in here, just
                   like they did before, man...
                   they're going to come in here
                   and get us, man, long before...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She survived longer than that
                   with no weapons and no training.

        Ripley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly.

                                  RIPLEY
                   So you better just start dealing
                   with it.  Just deal with it,
                   Hudson...because we need you and
                   I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now
                   get on a terminal and call up some
                   kind of floor plan file.
                   Construction blueprints,
                   maintenance schematics, anything
                   that shows the layout of this
                   place.  I want to see air ducts,
                   electrical access tunnels,
                   subbasements.  Every possible way
                   into this wing.

        Hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction.
        Hicks nods approval of her handling of it.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.  I'm on it.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'll be in medical.  I'd like to
                   continue my analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Fine.  You do that.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         117

        Burke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a large
        HORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table.
        Newt hops from one foot to the other to see.

                                  RIPLEY
                   This service tunnel is how they're
                   moving back and forth.

                                  HUDSON
                   Yeah, right, it runs from the
                   processing station right into
                   the sublevel here.

        He traces a finger along the abstract ground plan.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  There's a fire door
                   at this end.  The first thing we
                   do is put a remote sentry in the
                   tunnel and seal that door.

                                  HICKS
                   We gotta figure on them getting
                   into the complex.

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.  So we put up
                   welded barricades at these
                   intersections...
                          (pointing)
                   ...and seal these ducts here
                   and here.  Then they can only
                   come at us from these two
                   corridors and we create a free
                   field of fire for the other
                   two sentry units, here.

        Hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand,
        satisfied.

                                  HICKS
                   Outstanding.  Then all we need's
                   a deck of cards.  All right, let's
                   move like we got a purpose.

                                  HUDSON
                   Aye-firmative.

                                  NEWT
                          (imitating Hudson)
                   Aye-firmative!

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVEL                          118

        A long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit,
        seems to go on forever.  Vasquez and Hudson have
        finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on
        tripods in the tunnel.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   Testing!

        She hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the
        automatic field of fire.  The sentry guns swivel
        smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled
        by two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS into
        dime-sized shrapnel.  They retreat behind a heavy steel
        FIRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track.  Vasquez,
        using a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the door
        to its frame, as Hudson paces nervously.

                                  HUDSON
                   Hudson here.  A and B
                   sentries are in place and
                   keyed.  We're sealing the
                   tunnel.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL CORRIDOR                              119

        Hicks pauses in his work.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.

        He and Ripley are covering an air duct opening with
        a metal plate, welding it in place, showering sparks
        in the dark corridor.  Behind them Burke and Newt
        are moving back and forth with cartons of food on a
        hand truck, stacking it inside the operations center.
        Hicks sets down his welder and pulls a small object
        out of a belt pouch.  A braceletlike EMERGENCY
        LOCATING BEEPER.

                                  HICKS
                   Here, put this on.  Then
                   I can locate you anywhere
                   in the complex on this --

        He indicates a tiny TRACKER hooked to his battle
        harness.  He shrugs, a little self-consciously.

                                  HICKS
                   Just a...precaution.  You
                   know.

        Ripley pauses for a moment, regarding him
        quizzically.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (strapping
                          it on)
                   Thanks.

                                  HUDSON
                   Uh, what's next?

        She consults a printout of the floor plan.

        EXT. CONTROL BLOCK                                      120

        The wind has died utterly and in the even more eerie
        stillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shroud
        the complex.  Visibility is low in the fog.
        Everything looks underwater.  There is no movement.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           121

        In the barricaded corridor sentry-gun "C" sits waiting,
        its "ARMED" light flashing green.  Through a hole
        torn in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor
        the fog swirls in.  Water drips.  An expectant hush.

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX - OPERATING ROOM                     122

        Ripley carries an exhausted Newt through the inner
        connecting rooms of the medical wing.  She reaches
        an OPERATING ROOM which is small but very high-tech
        ...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment.
        Several metal cots have been set up, displacing O.R.
        equipment which is pushed into one corner.

        Newt is resting her head on Ripley's shoulder, barely
        awake...out of steam.  Ripley sets her on one of
        the cots and Newt lies down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now you just lie here and
                   have a nap.  You're exhausted.

                                  NEWT
                   I don't want to...I have
                   scary dreams.

        This obviously strikes a chord with Ripley, but she
        feigns cheerfulness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll bet Casey doesn't have
                   bad dreams.

        Ripley lifts the doll's head from Newt's tiny fingers
        and looks inside.  It is, of course, empty.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Nothing bad in here.  Maybe
                   you could just try to be like
                   her.

        Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back.
        Newt rolls her eyes as if to say "don't pull that
        five-year-old shit on me, lady.  I'm six."

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley...she doesn't have
                   bad dreams because she's just
                   a piece of plastic.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Oh.  Sorry, Newt.

                                  NEWT
                   My mommy always said there
                   were no monsters.  No real
                   ones.  But there are.

        Ripley's expression becomes sober.  She brushes damp
        hair back from the child's pale forehead.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Yes, there are, aren't there.

                                  NEWT
                   Why do they tell little kids
                   that?

        Newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal.
        She's seen that the world can be just as terrifying
        as her most primal child's nightmare if not more
        so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is
        no Santa.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well, some kids can't handle
                   it like you can.

                                  NEWT
                   Did one of those things grow
                   inside her?

        Ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in
        around her tiny body.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, Newt.  That's
                   the truth.

                                  NEWT
                   Isn't that how babies come?
                   I mean people babies...they
                   grow inside you?

                                  RIPLEY
                   No, it's different, honey.

                                  NEWT
                   Did you ever have a baby?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes.  A little girl.

                                  NEWT
                   Where is she?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Gone.

                                  NEWT
                   You mean dead.

        It's more statement than question.  Ripley nods slowly.

        She turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATER
        sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed.  She
        switches it on.  It HUMS and emits a cozy orange
        glow.

                                  NEWT
                   Ripley, I was just thinking...
                   Maybe I could do you a favor and
                   fill in for her.  Just for a
                   while.  You can try it and if
                   you don't like it, it's okay.
                   I'll understand.  No big deal.
                   Whattya think?

        Ripley gazes at her a long time before answering...
        a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her
        in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them
        may see another dawn.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I think it's not the worst idea
                   I've heard all day.  Let's talk
                   about it later.

        She switches off the light and starts to rise.  Newt
        grabs her arm.  A plaintive voice in the dark.

                                  NEWT
                   Don't go!  Please.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I'll be right in the other
                   room, Newt.  And look...I can
                   see you on that camera right
                   up there.

        Newt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door.
        Ripley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her by
        Hicks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching it
        down.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.  Take is for luck.  Now
                   go to sleep...and don't dream.

        Ripley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, hugging
        Casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function
        light on the bracelet.  The space heater hums
        comfortingly.

        INT. MED LAB                                            123

        ECU Gorman, his eyelids slitted open like those of a
        corpse, but with the eyes tracking erratically.  The
        only sign of life.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   How is he?

        Ripley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lying
        motionless on an examining table.  Bishop looks up
        from his instruments nearby, the light of a single
        gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.

                                  BISHOP
                   I've isolated a neuro-muscular
                   toxin responsible for the
                   paralysis.  It seems to be
                   metabolizing.  He should wake
                   up soon.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now let me get this straight.
                   The aliens paralyzed the colonists,
                   carried them over there,
                   cocooned them to be hosts for
                   more of those...

        Ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the
        face-hugger specimens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Which would mean lots of
                   those parasites, right?  One
                   for each person...over a hundred
                   at least.

                                  BISHOP
                   Yes.  That follows.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But these things come from
                   eggs...so where are all the
                   eggs coming from.

                                  BISHOP
                   That is the question of the
                   hour.  We could assume a parallel
                   to certain insect forms who
                   have hivelike organization.
                   An ant of termite colony, for
                   example, is ruled by a single
                   female, a queen, which is the
                   source of new eggs.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You're saying one of those things
                   lays all the eggs?

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, the queen is always physically
                   larger then the others.  A
                   termite queen's abdomen is so
                   bloated with eggs that it can't
                   move at all.  It is fed and tended
                   by drone workers, defended by
                   the warriors.  She is the center
                   of their lives, quite literally
                   the  mother of their society.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Could it be intelligent?

                                  BISHOP
                   Hard to say.  It may have been
                   blind instinct...attraction to
                   the heat of whatever...but she
                   did choose to incubate her eggs
                   in the one spot where we couldn't
                   destroy her without destroying
                   ourselves.  That's if she exists,
                   of course.

        Ripley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (rising)
                   I want those specimens destroyed
                   as soon as you're done with them.
                   You understand?

        Bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently
        in their cylinders.

                                  BISHOP
                   Mr. Burke have instructions
                   that they were to be kept alive
                   in stasis for return to the
                   company labs.  He was very specific.

        Ripley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing.
        She slaps the intercom switch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      124

        In a small observation chamber separated from the med
        lab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke have
        squared off.

                                  BURKE
                   Those specimens are worth
                   millions to the bio-weapons
                   division.  Now, if you're smart
                   we can both come out of this
                   heroes.  Set up for life.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You just try getting a dangerous
                   organism past ICC quarantine.
                   Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.

                                  BURKE
                   You've been doing your homework.
                   Look, they can't impound it if
                   they don't know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they will know about it, Burke.
                   From me.  Just like they'll know
                   how you were responsible for the
                   deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven
                   colonists here --

                                  BURKE
                   Now, wait a second --

                                  RIPLEY
                          (stepping on him)
                   You sent them to that ship.  I
                   just checked the colony log...
                   directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.
                   Signed Burke, Carter J.

        Ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and
        rage finally have a target to focus on.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You sent them out there and you
                   didn't even warn them, Burke.
                   Why didn't you warn them?

                                  BURKE
                   Look, maybe the thing didn't even
                   exist, right?  And if I'd made it
                   a major security situation, the
                   Administration would've stepped
                   in.  Then no exclusive rights,
                   nothing.

        He shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.

                                  BURKE
                   It was a bad call, that's all.

        Ripley snaps.  She slams him against the wall, surprising
        herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Bad call?  These people are fucking
                   dead, Burke!  Well, they're going
                   to nail your hide to the shed...
                   and I'll be there when they do.

        She steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter
        loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far
        more horrific revelation than any alien.

                                  BURKE
                          (sadly)
                   I expected more of you, Ripley.
                   I thought you would be smarter
                   than this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Sorry to disappoint you.

        She turns away and strides out.  The door closes.
        Burke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           125

        Ripley is walking toward operations when a STRIDENT
        ALARM begins to sound.  She breaks into a run.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         126

        Ripley double-times it to Hicks' TACTICAL CONSOLE
        where Hudson and Vasquez have already gathered.  Hicks
        slaps a switch, killing the alarm.

                                  HICKS
                   They're coming.  They're in
                   the tunnel.

        The TRILLING of the motion sensor remains, speeding up.
        TWO RED LIGHTS on the tactical display light up
        simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which
        vibrates the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing
                   on multiple targets.

        The RSS guns pound away, echoing through the complex.
        Their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm.
        A counter on the display counts down the number of
        rounds fired.

                                  HUDSON
                   They must be wall to wall in
                   there.  Look  at those ammo counters
                   go.  It's a shooting gallery down
                   there.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - TIGHT ON RSS GUNS                 127

        blasting stroboscopically in the tunnels.  Their barrels
        are overheating, glowing cherry red.  One CLICKS empty
        and sits smoking, still swiveling to track targets it
        can't fire upon.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         128

        The digital counter on B gun reads zero.

                                  HICKS
                   B gun's dry.  Twenty on A.
                   Ten.  Five.  That's it.

        SILENCE.  Then a GONGLIKE BOOMING echoes eerily up from
        sublevel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're at the fire door.

        The BOOMING INCREASES in volume and ferocity.

                                  HUDSON
                   Man, listen to that.

        Mixed with the echoing crash-clang is a nerve-wrecking
        SCREECH of claws on steel.  The intercom buzzes,
        startling them.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over)
                   Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have
                   some bad news.

                                  HUDSON
                   Well, that's a switch.

        INT. OPERATIONS - MINUTES LATER                         129

        Everyone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window,
        intently watching the AP station which is a dim
        silhouette in the mist.  Suddenly a column of flame,
        like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex
        at the base of the cone.

                                  BISHOP
                   That's it.  See it?  Emergency
                   venting.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How long until it blows?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm projecting total systems
                   failure in a little under four
                   hours.  The blast radius will be
                   about thirty kilometers.  About
                   equal to ten megatons.

                                  HICKS
                   We got problems.

                                  HUDSON
                   I don't fucking believe this.
                   Do you believe this?

                                  RIPLEY
                   And it's too late to shut it down?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm afraid so.  The crash did too
                   much damage.  The overload is
                   inevitable, at this point.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short,
                   too!  Four more weeks and out.
                   Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'
                   rock.  It ain't half fair, man!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Hudson, give us a break.

        They watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shrouded
        landscape.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Hicks)
                   We need the other drop-ship.  The
                   on one the Sulaco.  We have to
                   bring it down on remote, somehow.

                                  HUDSON
                   How?  The transmitter was on the
                   APC.  It's wasted.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (pacing)
                   I don't care how!  Think of a
                   way.  Think of something.

                                  HUDSON
                   Think of what?  We're fucked.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What about the colony transmitter?
                   That up-link tower down at the
                   other end.  Why can't we use that?

                                  BISHOP
                   I checked.  The hard wiring
                   between here and there was severed
                   in the fighting.

        Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out
        options, grim solutions.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Well then somebody's just going
                   to have to go out there.  Take a
                   portable terminal and go out there
                   and plug in manually.

                                  HUDSON
                   Oh, right!  Right!  With those
                   things running around.  No way.

                                  BISHOP
                          (quietly)
                   I'll go.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What?

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm really the only one qualified
                   to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
                   Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I
                   may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.

                                  RIPLEY
                   All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll
                   you need?

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Listen.  It's stopped.

        They listen.  Nothing.  An instant later comes the
        HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm.  Hicks
        looks at the tactical board.

                                  HICKS
                   Well, they're into the complex.

        INT. MED LAB                                            130

        One of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has
        yielded access to subfloor conduits.  Bishop lying in
        the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal
        as Ripley hands it down to him.  He pushes it into
        the constricted shaft ahead of him.  She then hands him
        a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch
        cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.

                                  BISHOP
                   This duct runs almost to the
                   up-link assembly.  One hundred
                   eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes
                   to crawl down there.  One hour
                   to patch in and align the antenna.
                   Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
                   then about fifty minutes flight time.

        Ripley looks at her watch.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's going to be closer.  You
                   better get going.

                                  BISHOP
                          (cheerfully)
                   See you soon.

        She squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along
        ahead of him with a scraping rhythm.  The diameter of
        the conduit is barely larger than the width of his
        shoulders.  Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole
        and begins spot welding it in place.

        INT. CONDUIT                                            131

        Bishop looks back as the welder seals him in.  He sighs
        fatalistically and squirms forward.  Ahead of him the
        conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity.  Like
        being in the bore of a very long Howitzer.

        INT. MED LAB                                            132

        Ripley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through the
        complex.

                                  HICKS
                          (voice over)
                   They're in the approach corridor.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (into mike)
                   On my way.

        Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from her
        shoulder in one motion, and sprints for Operations with
        Vasquez.  The sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up in
        staccato bursts echoes from close by.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         133

        Ripley runs to the tactical console where Hicks is
        mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras.
        The flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive
        video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky
        corridor are occasionally visible.  The robot sentries
        hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into
        the swirling mist.

                                  HICKS
                   Twenty meters and closing.
                   Fifteen.  C and D guns down
                   about fifty percent.

        The digital readout whirl through descending numbers.
        An inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between bursts
        of fire.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Now many?

                                  HICKS
                   Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's
                   down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.

        Then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly.
        The video image is a swirling wall of smoke.  Small fires
        burn, dim glows in the mist.  There are black and
        twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered
        at the edge of visibility.  However, nothing emerges
        from the wall of smoke.  The motion sensor TONE shuts off.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They retreated.  The guns stopped
                   them.

        The moment stretches.  Everyone exhales slowly.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  But look...

        The digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0"
        and "10" respectively.  Less than a second's worth of
        firing.

                                  HICKS
                   Newt time then can walk right
                   up and knock.

                                  RIPLEY
                   But they don't know that.  They're
                   probably looking for other ways
                   to get in.  That'll take them awhile.

                                  HUDSON
                   Maybe we got 'em demoralized.

                                  HICKS
                          (to Vasquez
                          and Hudson)
                   I want you two walking the perimeter.
                   I know we're all in strung out
                   shape but stay frosty and alert.
                   We've got to stop any entries before
                   they get out of hand.

        The two troopers nod and head for the corridor.  Ripley
        sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it in
        one gulp.

                                  HICKS
                   How long since you slept?
                   Twenty-four hours?

        Ripley shrugs.  She seems soul weary, drained by the
        nerve-wracking tension.  When she answers, her voice
        seems distant, detached.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (grimly)
                   They'll get us.

                                  HICKS
                   Maybe.  Maybe not.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like
                   those others.  You'll take care of
                   it won't you, it if comes to that?

                                  HICKS
                   If it comes to that, I'll do us
                   both.  Let's see that it doesn't
                   Here, I'd like to introduce you to
                   a close personal friend of mine.

        He picks up his pulse-rifle and with the casually precise
        movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drops
        out the magazine and hands it to her.

                                  HICKS
                   M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and
                   under with a 30mm pump-action
                   grenade launcher.

        Ripley hefts the weapon.  It is heavy and awkward.  But
        there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal
        cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will
        be in some greater measure the master of her own fate.
        She raises it clumsily.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What do I do?

        INT. CONDUIT                                            134

        Bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing
        infinities.  The pipe rings with his scraping advance.
        He approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny
        shaft of light.  He puts his eyes up to the acid-etched
        opening.

        HIS P.O.V.  as drooling jaws flash toward us, SLAMMING
        against the steel with a vicious scraping SNAP.

        Bishop flattens himself away from the opening and
        inches along, looking pale and strained.  He glances at
        his watch.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         135

        Ripley has the stock of the M-41A snugged up to her cheek
        and is awkwardly trying to keep up with Hicks'
        instructions.  The Corporal is standing close behind her,
        positioning her arms.  It's intimate but that's the
        last thing on their minds.

                                  HICKS
                   Just pull it in real right.  It
                   will kick some.  When the counter
                   here heads zero, hit this...

        He thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clattering
        on the floor.

                                  HICKS
                   Just let it drop right out.  Get
                   the other one in quick.  Just
                   slap it in hard, it likes abuse.
                   Now, pull the bolt.

        CLACK.

                                  HICKS
                   You're ready again.

        Ripley repeats the action, not very smoothly.  Her hands
        are trembling.  She indicates a stout TUBE underneath
        the slender pulse-rifle barrel.

                                  RIPLEY
                   What's this?

                                  HICKS
                   Well, that's the grenade launcher
                   ...you probably don't want to
                   mess with that.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Look, you started this.  Now show
                   me everything.  I can handle myself.

                                  HICKS
                   Yeah.  I've noticed.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           136

        DOLLYING WITH Ripley walking down the corridor, now
        carrying the newfound friend, the M-41A.  Gorman steps
        out of the door to the med lab, looking weak but sound.
        Burke is right behind him.

                                  RIPLEY
                   How do you feel?

                                  GORMAN
                   All right, I guess.  One hell
                   of a hangover.  Look, Ripley...
                   I...

                                  RIPLEY
                   Forget it.

        She shoulders by him into the med lab.  Gorman turns to
        see Vasquez staring at him with cold, slitted eyes.

                                  GORMAN
                   You still want to kill me?

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (turning away)
                   It won't be necessary.

        INT. MED LAB - ANNEX                                    137

        Ripley crosses the deserted lab, passing through the
        annex to the small O.R. where she left Newt.

        INT. MED LAB - O.R.                                     138

        Entering the darkened chamber, Ripley looks around.
        Newt is nowhere to be seen.  On a hunch she kneels down
        and peers under the bed.  Newt is curled up there,
        jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep.  Still
        clutching "Casey."

        Ripley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite
        the demons that have chased her through her dreams and
        the reality between dreams.  Ripley lays the rifle on
        top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath.  Without
        waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her.

        Ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling
        together in the darkness under their bed.

        Newt's face contorts with the externalization of some
        tormented dreamscape.  She cries out, a vague inarticulate
        plea.  Ripley rocks her gently.

                                  RIPLEY
                   There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all
                   right.

        EXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION                 139

        A VIEW OF the processing station from the colony landing
        platform.  A rising wind is clearing out the low fog and
        the silhouette of the station grows sharper.  Several
        systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the
        conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in
        the darkness.  High voltage discharges arc around the
        upper latticework, lighting the blighted landscape
        with irregular glaring flashes.

        PAN ONTO BISHOP, F.G.  hunched against the wind at the
        base of the telemetry tower.  He has a TEST-BAY PANEL
        open and the portable terminal patched in.  His jacket
        is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect
        it from the elements and he is typing frenetically.

                                  BISHOP
                          (to himself)
                   Now, if I did it right...

        He punches a key marked "ENABLE."

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT                       140

        The drop bay is empty and silent, with the remaining
        ship brooding in the shadows.  A KLAXON sounds and
        rotating clearance lights come on.  Hydraulics whine
        to life.  Drop-ship two moves out on its overhead track
        and is lowered into the drop bay fro launch-prep.
        Service booms and fueling couplers move in automatically
        around the hull.  A recorded announcement echoes across
        the huge chamber.

                                  FEMALE VOICE
                   Attention.  Attention.  Automatic
                   fueling operations have begun.
                   Please extinguish all smoking
                   materials.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - MED LAB         141

        as she awakens with a start.  She checks her watch...
        an hour has passed.  She gently disengages herself from
        Newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot
        when she sees something and FREEZES.

        Across the room, just inside the door to the med lab,
        are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects.
        TWO STASIS CYLINDERS.  Their tops are hinged open, and
        the suspension fields are switched off.  They are both
        EMPTY.  Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror
        rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the
        inescapable certainty of a lethal presence.  Unable to
        move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing
        the situation.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Newt.  Newt, wake up.

                                  NEWT
                   Wah...?  Where are...?

                                  RIPLEY
                          (whispers)
                   Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in
                   trouble.

        Newt nods, now wide awake.  They listen in the darkness
        for the slightest betrayal of movement.  The scrabble
        of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example.

        There is only the droning HUM of the little space heater.
        Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the
        underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the
        wall.

        The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor
        is jarringly loud in the stillness.

        When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
        herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot,
        reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
        mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle
        is GONE.

        She snaps her head around.  A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS
        TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed!  She ducks with
        a startled cry.  The obscene thing hits the wall above
        her, legs moving lightning fast.  Reflexively she slams
        the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches
        above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with
        incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing
        SQUEAL.

        Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a
        frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She
        flips it over, trapping the creature underneath.

        They back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around
        the shadowed room where every corner of space
        between equipment holds lethal promise.  The creature
        scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a
        back of cabinets in a blur.  Ripley hugs Newt close
        and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in
        the room had a million volts running through it.  She
        reaches the door.  Hits the wall switch.  Nothing
        happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights.
        Nothing.  She pounds on the door.  The acoustically
        dampened door panel thunks dully.  She moves to the
        observation window, glancing frantically over her
        shoulder.  The bare floor behind her is like a screaming
        threat.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (shouting)
                   Hey...hey!

        She pounds on the window.  Through the double
        thickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark and
        empty.  Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling
        behind her.  Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her
        fear.  She steps in front of the video surveillance
        camera and waves her arms in a circle.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks!  Hicks!

        INT. OPERATIONS - TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR                142

        showing Ripley waving her arms.  There is no sound,
        a surreal pantomime.

        A hand ENTERS FRAME and switches off the monitor.
        Ripley's image vanishes.

        WIDER ANGLE  as Burke straightens casually from
        the console.  Hicks is talking via headset with
        Bishop and hasn't noticed Ripley's plight or
        Burke's action.

                                  HICKS
                          (into mike)
                   Roger.  Check back when you've
                   activated the ship.
                          (turning)
                   He's at the up-link tower.

                                  BURKE
                          (calmly)
                   Excellent.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     143

        Ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against
        the observation window.  It bounces back from the
        high-impact material.  She tries again.

        REVERSE ANGLE  from the med lab side, showing her
        futile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWACK
        barely audible through the double thickness pressure
        port.

        Ripley turns, studying the room.  She fumbles through
        a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and
        finds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT.  Snapping it on she
        plays the beam over the walls.  Tall assemblies of
        surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the
        dark.  She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements.  The
        light spins across the room, swiveling and bobbing
        frantically.  Like an indicator of her growing panic.
        Newt starts a thin, high wailing.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...mommmyyyyy...

        Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and
        the child's dependence on her.  She plays the beam
        across the ceiling.  Holds on something.  Gets an idea.
        She removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks
        up some papers from the counter.  Moving cautiously
        she boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the center
        of the room and clambers up after her.

                                  NEWT
                   Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm
                   scared.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I know, honey.  Me too.

        Ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass
        under the temperature sensor of a fire control system
        SPRINKLER HEAD.  It triggers, spraying the room from
        several sources with water.  An ALARM sounds throughout
        the complex.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         144

        Hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm, finally
        identifying its source among the lights flashing on
        his board.  He bolts for the door, yelling into his
        headset as he moves.

                                  HICKS
                   Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in
                   medical!  We got a fire!

        INT. OPERATING ROOM                                     145

        Ripley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers
        continue to drizzle in the darkness.  The SIREN
        hoots maniacally, masking all other sound.  Ripley
        scans the room with her light, her hair plastered
        to her face, wiping water out of her eyes.  She is
        eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She
        looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.
        Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT
        HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table,
        splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles
        away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of
        her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings
        for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a
        steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling
        equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the
        floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of
        multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.

        She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for
        its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head,
        avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly,
        backing away, until she is pressed up against a
        desk in one corner.

        Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body
        back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around
        her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside
        of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about,
        knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.
        Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her
        and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's
        body.

        ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the
        desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking
        fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the
        writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against
        all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.
        She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
        gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing
        itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.

        The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's
        head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
        from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly
        from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing
        itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
        her face.

        A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette
        behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot.
        Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of
        pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks
        dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
        into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits
        rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and
        slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the
        thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between
        the two of them they force is away from her face,
        though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
        sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the
        room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding
        across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature
        against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke.

        Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail,
        unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor
        coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling,
        SHRIEKING creature.

                                  HICKS
                   The corner!  Ready?

                                  HUDSON
                   Do it!

        Hicks hurls the thing into the corner.  It scrabbles
        upright in an instant and leaps back toward them.
        WHAM!  Hudson gets it clean.

        Ripley collapses, gagging.  The alarm and sprinklers
        shut off automatically.  Hicks sees the stasis
        cylinders.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (coughing)
                   Burke...it was Burke.

        INT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSON                       146

        looking decidedly stressed-out.  He grips his rifle
        tightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA.

                                  HUDSON
                          (intense)
                   I say we grease this rat-fuck
                   son of a bitch right now!

        THE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in a
        chair, maintaining an icy calm although beads of
        sweat betray intense concealed tension.  Only a few
        minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on
        adrenaline, as if the whole group is charged with
        high voltage.

                                  HICKS
                          (pacing)
                   I don't get it.  It doesn't
                   make any Goddamn sense.

        Ripley stands in front of Burke, every fiber of
        her being accusing him with absolute outrage.  Burke
        tries to break Ripley's stare, which is like a
        diamond drill.  He can't.

                                  RIPLEY
                   He wanted an alien, only he
                   couldn't get it back through
                   quarantine.  But if we were impregnated
                   ...whatever you call it...and then
                   frozen for the trip back at just
                   the right time...then nobody would
                   know about the embryos we were carrying.
                   We and Newt.

        Ripley glances at the little girl, a frail figure
        sitting nearby, hugging her knees and watching the
        proceedings with somber eyes.  She is all but lost in
        an adult jacket someone has found for her, and her still
        damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks.

                                  HICKS
                   Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.

                                  RIPLEY
                   The only way it would work is if
                   he sabotaged certain freezers
                   on the trip back.  Then he could
                   jettison the bodies and make up
                   any story he liked.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fuuuck!  He's dead.
                          (to Burke)
                   You're dogmeat, pal.

                                  BURKE
                   This is total paranoid delusion.
                   It's pitiful.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (wearily)
                   You know, Burke, I don't know
                   which species is worse.  You don't
                   see them screwing each other over
                   for a fucking percentage.

                                  HICKS
                          (serious)
                   Let's waste him.
                          (to Burke)
                   No offense.

        Ripley shakes her head, the rage giving way to a
        sickened emptiness.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Just find someplace to lock him
                   up until it's time to --

        THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  Everyone stops in the sudden darkness,
        realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the
        struggle.  Hicks looks at the board.  Everything is out.
        Doors.  Video screens.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They cut the power.

                                  HUDSON
                   What do you mean, they cut the
                   power?  How could they cut the
                   power, man?  They're animals.

        Ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Stay close.
                          (to the others)
                   Let's get some trackers going.
                   Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch
                   Burke.

        Hudson and Vasquez pick up their scanners and move to
        the door.  Vasquez has to slide it open manually on its
        track.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           147

        The two troopers separate and move rapidly to the
        barriers at opposite ends of the control block.

        DOLLYING WITH VASQUEZ as she moves forward with feral
        steps in the darkness.

        ON HUDSON  scanning the med lab and the nearby barrier.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Anything?

        BEEP.  Hudson's tracker lights up, a faint signal.

                                  HUDSON
                   There's something.

        He pans it around.  Back down the corridor.  It beep
        again, louder.

                                  HUDSON
                   It's inside the complex.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (voice over)
                   You're just reading me.

                                  HUDSON
                   No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're
                   inside.  Inside the perimeter.
                   They're in here.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez?

        ANGLE ON VASQUEZ  swinging her tracker and rifle together.
        She aims it behind her.  BEEP.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (cool)
                   Hudson may be right.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         148

        Ripley and Hicks share a look..."here we go."

                                  HICKS
                          (low)
                   It's game time.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get back here, both of you.  Fall
                   back to Operations.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           149

        Hudson backtracks nervously, peering all around.  He
        looks stretched to the limit.

                                  HUDSON
                   This signal's weird...must be
                   some interference or something.
                   There's movement all over the
                   place...

                                  RIPLEY
                          (voice over)
                   Just get back here!

        Hudson reaches the door to operations at a run, a
        moment before Vasquez.  They pull the door shut and
        lock it.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         150

        Hudson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out their
        armament.  Flamethrowers.  Grenades.  M-41A magazines.
        Hudson's tracker beeps.  Then again.  The tone continues
        through the SCENE, its rhythm increasing.

                                  HUDSON
                   Movement!  Signal's clean.

        He pans the scanner.  Stops.  The range display reads
        out, counting down.

                                  HUDSON
                   Range twenty meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Vasquez)
                   Seal the door.

        Vasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply.

                                  HUDSON
                   Seventeen meters.

                                  HICKS
                   Let's get these things lit.

        He hands one flamethrower to RIpley and begins priming
        the other himself.  It lights with a muffled POP.
        Ripley's lights a moment later.  Sparks shower around
        Vasquez as she begins welding the door.  Hudson's tracker
        is beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They learned.  They cut the power
                   and avoided the guns.  They must
                   have found another way in, something
                   we missed.

                                  HICKS
                   We didn't miss anything.

                                  HUDSON
                   Fifteen meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   I don't know, an acid hole in
                   a duct.  Something under the
                   floors, not on the plans.
                   I don't know!

        She picks up Vasquez' scanner and aims it the same
        direction as Hudson's.

                                  HUDSON
                   Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big
                   fucking signal.  Ten meters.

                                  RIPLEY
                   They're right on us.  Vasquez,
                   how you doing?

        Vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal
        as she welds the door shut.  Working like a demon.

                                  HUDSON
                   Nine meters.  Eight.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Can't be.  That's inside the room!

                                  HUDSON
                   It's readin' right.  Look!

        Ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.

                                  HICKS
                   Well you're not reading it right!

                                  HUDSON
                   Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --

        He looks at Ripley.  It dawns on both of them at the same
        time.  She feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles
        her tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead.  The
        tone gets louder.

        Hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of
        acoustic drop-ceiling.  He shines his light inside.

        HICKS' P.O.V.                                           151

        A soul-wrenching nightmare image.  Moving in the beam of
        light are aliens.  Lots of aliens.  They are crawling
        like bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beams
        of the structural ceiling, not touching the flimsy
        acoustic panels.  They glisten hideously as they claw
        their way forward in silence.  They cover the ceiling
        of the operations room.  The inner sanctum is utterly
        violated.

        ON HICKS                                                152

        blasted by fear.

        Something moves...he snaps the light around.  It's a
        meter behind him.  IT LUNGES!  He drops reflexively,
        the claws raking across his armor.

        Hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach
        en masse from the handholds.  THE CEILING EXPLODES,
        raining debris.  Nightmare shapes drop into the room.
        Newt screams.  Hudson opens fire.  Vasquez grabs Hicks,
        pulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower.
        Ripley scoops up Newt and staggers back.  Gorman turns
        to fire and Burke bolts for the only remaining exit,
        the corridor connecting to the med lab.  In the
        strobelike glare of the pulse-rifles we SEE flashes
        of aliens, moving forward in the smoke from the
        flamethrower fires.  They move like nothing human...
        leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with
        powerful, balletic grace.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Medical!  Get to medical!

        She dashes for the corridor.

        INT. MED LAB CORRIDOR                                   153

        DOLLYING BEHIND HER as she sprints, the walls becoming
        a frenzied blur.  Ahead of her Burke clears the door to
        the med lab.  HE SLIDES IT CLOSED.  Ripley slams into
        the door.  Tries the latch.  Hears it LOCK from the far
        side.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Burke!  Open the door!

                                  NEWT
                   Look!

        Behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a
        locomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and
        inhuman as you can imagine.  Strobe flashes backlight
        the demented silhouette.  Shaking, Ripley raises her
        rifle.  She squeezes the trigger.  NOTHING HAPPENS.
        The creature HISSES, baring its teeth as it advances.
        Ripley checks the SAFETY.  The safety is off.  The
        DIGITAL COUNTER.  The magazine is full.  Newt begins to
        wail.  Ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are trembling
        so much she almost drops the rifle.  Panic screams in
        her brain.  The thing is almost on her, filling the
        corridor, when she remembers.  She snaps the bolt back,
        chambering a round.  Whips the stock to her shoulder.
        FIRES.  FLASH-CRACK!  A FLASHBULB GLIMPSE OF shrieking
        jaws as the silhouette is hurled back, screeching
        insanely.

        Ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil,
        blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion.

        INT. OPERATIONS                                         154

        Hicks looks up.  Fires POINT-BLANK at a leaping
        silhouette.  SCREEEECH!  The fire-control system has
        tripped, with sprinklers spraying the room and a
        mindless SIREN wailing.  Total pandemonium.

                                  HUDSON
                          (hysterical)
                   Let's go!  Let's go!

                                  HICKS
                   Fuckin' A!

        Hudson screams as floor panels lift under him, and clawed
        arms seize him lightning fast, dragging him down.
        Another skeletal shape leaps on him from above.  He
        disappears into the subfloor crawlway.  Hicks, Vasquez
        and Gorman make it to the med lab access corridor.

        INT. CORRIDOR

        Stunned, Ripley sees through dissipating smoke the
        creature rising to advance again.  Flinching against
        blast and glare she drills it POINT-BLANK with a
        BLINDING BURST that carries the M-41A's muzzle right
        up toward the ceiling.  Newt covers her ears against
        the CONCUSSION.

                                  HICKS
                          (o.s.)
                   Hold you fire!

        The troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (indicating door)
                   Locked.

                                  HICKS
                   Stand back.

        Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the
        lock.  Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor.
        Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings
        her rifle.  She starts loading 30mm grenades into the
        launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells.

                                  GORMAN
                   You can't use those in here!

                                  VASQUEZ
                   Right.  Fire in the hole!

        She pumps a round up and fires.  The grenade EXPLODES and
        the blast almost knocks them down.  Hicks kicks the door
        open, molten droplets flying.

                                  HICKS
                          (shouting at Vasquez)
                   Thanks a lot!  Now I can't hear shit.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (shouting)
                   What?

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      156

        Vasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three
        grenades rapid-fire through the gap.  She slams the door
        home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding
        gonglike through the metal.

        Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door.
        Burke has locked it as well.  Hicks switches his
        hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door
        they just passed through.

        INT. MED LAB                                            157

        Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the
        dark chamber.  Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he
        crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main
        concourse.  His fingers reach for the latch.  It moves
        by itself.  The door opens slowly.

        ON BURKE  his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate.  We
        hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we:

                                                        CUT TO:

        INT. MED LAB ANNEX                                      158

        The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating
        slightly from its frame.  Another crash, the squeal of
        tortured steel.  Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and
        tugs her across the room.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on!  This way.

        She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and
        expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open.  Newt
        starts inside but Ripley pulls her back.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Stay behind me.

        Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before
        he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a
        tight fit.  Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks,
        Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard.  Glancing back
        fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl
        rapidly through the shaft.

                                  NEWT
                   Come on.  Crawl faster.

                                  RIPLEY
                   DO you know how to get to the
                   landing field from here?

                                  NEWT
                   Sure.  Go left.

        Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is
        enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch.  She runs,
        scraping her back on the ceiling.  The troopers' armor
        clatters in the confined space.  They approach an
        intersection.  She fires the flamethrower around the
        corner, the looks.  Clear.

                                  NEWT
                   Go right.

        They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze
        becoming a blur.  Ripley fires the flamethrower
        periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by
        louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or
        lower levels.

                                  HICKS
                          (into headset)
                   Bishop, you read me?  Come in, over.

        There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost
        unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.

                                  BISHOP
                          (voice over;
                          static)
                   Yes, I read you.  Not very well...

        EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD                      159

        Bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry
        mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.

                                  BISHOP
                          (yelling;
                          over enunciating)
                   The ship is on its way.  ETA
                   about sixteen minutes.  I've
                   got my hands full flying...
                   the weather's come up a bit.

        Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and
        he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry
        updates rapidly.

        In the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon,
        wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges.

        INT. AIR DUCT                                           160

                                  HICKS
                   All right, stand by there.  We're
                   on out way.  Over.

        The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the
        tunnel ahead.  She blinks, seeing something...not sure.
        A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the
        tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Back.  Go back!

        They try to crawl back, jamming together.  Behind them,
        the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a
        FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior
        flows into the duct.  They are trapped.  Vasquez uses
        her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire.  Hicks
        snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the
        duct.  Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the
        tunnel with lurid light.  Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (icy)
                   Losing fuel.

        Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees the
        glistening apparitions closing in.  Hicks' torch feathers
        out.  Empty.  Bracing his back he kicks hard at the
        cherry-hot metal.  It bends aside.

        Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and
        conduit.  Hicks slides through the searing hole,
        lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out.
        Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman.  Vasquez'
        flamethrower goes dry.  She draws her SERVICE PISTOL.
        Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM
        A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her.

        She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM!  BAM!  BAM!
        Rolls aside.  It lands on her legs and she snaps her head
        to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the
        metal wall beside her cheek.  She fires again, emptying
        the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away.

        Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into
        her thigh.  She cries out, gritting her teeth against
        the white-hot pain.  Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to
        move.  Sees the creatures coming the other way...and
        turns away from the escape hole.  He crawls back to her,
        grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards
        safety.  Too late.  The approaching alien warriors have
        reached and passed the opening.  Vasquez sees him,
        barely conscious.

                                  VASQUEZ
                          (hoarse whisper)
                   You always were an asshole, Gorman.

        She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE
        it as the "power greeting" she shared with Drake...
        something for the chosen few.  Gorman returns the grip.
        He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the
        creatures are upon them.

        INT. SERVICE WAY                                        161

        RUSHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run.
        The service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behind
        them and they stumble with the shock wave.  Newt breaks
        out ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to keep
        up.

                                  NEWT
                   This way.  Come on, we're almost
                   there!

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, wait!

        The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around
        obstacles.  If it wasn't clear before it's clear now
        that we are on her turf, and she's the ace.  Running on
        and on, their breathing loud and echoing...the walls
        a directionless blur.  Newt never hesitates.

        They reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE which
        runs upward at a steep 45 degrees.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  Go up.

        INT. CHUTE                                              162

        Ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the
        top...an exterior vent hood.  The sound of wind booms
        down from above.  Like blowing across a bottle top
        vastly amplified.

        Ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow
        side ribs in the shaft.  She looks down.  The chute
        descends far into the depths, lost in shadow.  She
        starts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks,
        just emerging from the side duct.

                                  NEWT
                   Just up there --

        Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot.  She
        slides...catches herself with one hand.  Ripley reaches
        for her, dropping her light.  The hand-light goes
        skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend,
        and disappears.

        Ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's.
        They miss, inches apart.

                                  NEWT
                   Riiiiipppleee --

        She slips.  Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket.
        AND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT.  With an echoing scream Newt
        plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness.

        MOVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like
        a bobsled ride.  THe shaft pitches left.  Newt bounces,
        sliding halfway up the wall.  The chute forks ahead.
        Newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a
        steeper angle into the depths.  Just disappearing down
        the LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light.

        Ripley looks Hicks in the eye.  And kicks free...sliding
        down the chute after Newt.  Ripley slams her feet into
        the side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent.
        Ripley reaches the "V."  Sees the glow of the light in
        the left fork.  She goes left.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!

        She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it
        has no direction.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Mommy...where are you?

        Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it
        intersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL.  The light
        is lying there, but no Newt.  The echoing wail comes
        again.

                                  NEWT
                          (o.s.)
                   Moooommeeee...

        Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering.  Newt's call
        comes again.  Fainter?  She can't tell.  She spins in
        a growing panic, starts the other way.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to her headset)
                   Hicks, get down here.  I need
                   that locator.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        163

        Newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes
        and machines.  It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist.
        She looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating.
        Ripley's voice seems to come from there.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (o.s.)
                   Newt!  Star wherever you are!

        Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     164

        Hicks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locator
        from his belt.  They follow the signal into a lighted
        area where the power apparently was not cut.

                                  HICKS
                   This way.  We're close...

        Following the signal they come to a grating set in the
        floor.

                                  NEWT
                   Here!  I'm here.  I'm here.

        Ripley runs to the grating.  Looking down she sees Newt's
        tearstreaked face.  Newt reaches up.  Her tiny fingers
        wriggle up through the bars of the grate.  Ripley
        squeezes the child's precious fingertips.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Climb down, honey.  We have to
                   cut through this grate.

        Newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cuts
        into the bars with his hand-torch.

        INT. SUBBASEMENT                                        165

        Newt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks
        shower blindingly as Hicks cuts.  She bites her lip,
        trembling.  Cold and terrified.  Silently a glistening
        shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind
        her.  It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form.  Newt
        turns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as the
        shadow engulfs her.

        INT. SERVICE TUNNEL                                     166

        Ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing.
        She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing
        it down.  Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Ripley
        lunges into the hole with her light.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt!  Newt!

        The surface of the water reflects the beam placidly.
        Newt is gone.  Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is
        "Casey" the doll head.  In sinks slowly, distorting,
        vanishing in darkness.

        Hicks pulls Ripley away from the hole.  She struggles
        furiously, trying to tear out of his grip.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  Noooo!

        He drags her back.  It takes all of his strength.

                                  HICKS
                          (intense)
                   She's gone!  Let's go!

        He sees something moving toward them through a lattice
        of pipes.  Ripley is irrational.  Hysterical.

                                  RIPLEY
                   No!  No!  She's alive!  We
                   have to --

                                  HICKS
                   All right!  She's alive.  I
                   believe it.  But we gotta get
                   moving!  Now!

        He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the
        end of the tunnel.  Gets her inside, slamming her against
        the back wall.  Hits the button to go to surface level.
        An alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts
        toward them.  The doors are closing.  Not fast enough.
        The creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on
        it.  THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature.  THE
        WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING.  Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK.  It
        spins away, SCREECHING.  Acid sluices between the closing
        doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields
        Ripley with his body.  The lift starts upward.  Hicks'
        fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way
        toward his skin.  Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley
        claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can.  He
        screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm.  He
        shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping
        the smoking pieces to the floor.  Acrid fumes fill the
        air, searing eyes and lungs.  The elevator stops.  The
        doors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hicks
        who is doubled over in agony.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Come on, you can make it.
                   Almost there.

        EXT. LANDING FIELD                                      167

        Drop-ship two descends toward the landing grid,
        side-slipping in hurricane gusts.  Bishop stands, guiding
        it with the portable terminal.  The ship sets down hard.
        Slides sideways.  Stops.  Bishop turns as Ripley and
        Hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building
        behind him.  He goes to them, helping to support Hicks
        and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale.
        Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind.

                                  RIPLEY
                   HOW MUCH TIME?

                                   BISHOP
                   PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!

                                   RIPLEY
                   WE'RE NOT LEAVING!

        The loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship.

        EXT. PROCESSING STATION                                 168

        An infernal engine, roaring out of control.  Steam blasts
        and swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure and
        columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into
        the air.

        We APPROACH, hypnotically.  The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME,
        moving toward the station.  It pivots, hovering in the
        blasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDING
        PLATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a third
        of the way up the enormous structure.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          169

        Ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and
        drops the roll.  She has crudely fastened a M-41A
        assault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower.
        A massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower.  Her
        movements are curt, precise...determined.  She works
        rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other
        gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the
        drop-ship.

        Bishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help
        Hicks dress his injuries.  Hicks is sprawled in a flight
        seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around
        him.  He's out of the game...contorted with pain.

                                  BISHOP
                   Ripley...

                                  RIPLEY
                   She's alive.  They brought her
                   here and you know it.

                                  BISHOP
                   In seventeen minutes this place
                   will be a cloud of vapor the
                   size of Nebraska.

        Ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hands
        flying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Hicks, don't let him leave.

                                  HICKS
                          (grimacing with
                          pain)
                   We ain't going anywhere.

        She hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spins
        to the door controls.  The door opens.  Wind and
        machine-thunder blast in.

                                  RIPLEY
                   See you, Hicks.

        Hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face.

                                  HICKS
                   Dwayne.  It's Dwayne.

        Ripley grabs his hand.  They share a moment, albeit
        brief.  Mutual respect in the valley of death.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Ellen.

                                  HICKS
                          (nods with
                          satisfaction)
                   Don't be long, Ellen.

        Ripley runs down the ramp, crossing the platform to the
        open doors of a LARGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  The doors close.

        INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR                                   170

        The elevator descends.  Bars of light move rhythmically
        across her as Ripley stands facing the doors, watching
        the landings go by.  The heat grows more intense.  Pipes
        glowing cherry-red pass by.  Steam hisses and billows.
        The lift clatters in a steady beat.  Hypnotic.

        Ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
        directly over her T-shirt.  Her hair is matted, and
        she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a
        determination that holds the gut-panic in check.

        The elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches
        a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the
        flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the
        bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the
        MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her
        jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling,
        forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't
        know doodley about grenades.

        This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She
        begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her fingers
        slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends.

        The lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a
        bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly,
        the doors open.

        HER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty
        corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow
        VISIBLE here and there.  It seems to have been a descent
        into Dantean Hell.  The air itself vibrates with heat
        distortion.  Couplings groan.  Machinery whines and
        throbs.  Like the beating of a vast heart the pounding
        of massive pumps echoes through the station.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           171

        Ripley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on the
        rifle.  Her eyes dart, straining to penetrate the lethal
        gloom.  Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to
        hers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor.  Ahead
        the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence
        and not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins.
        She enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR,
        taped to the top of her kludge weapon.

        A VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.

                                  VOICE
                   Attention.  Emergency.  All
                   personnel must evacuate
                   immediately.  You now have
                   fourteen minutes to reach
                   minimum safe distance.

        INT. CATACOMB                                           172

        Range and direction read out in rapid-fire alpha-numerics
        on the locator display.

        Ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the
        swirling steam of the alien maze.  She approaches an
        intersecting tunnel.  Flashing emergency lights
        illuminate the insane fresco of the walls.  She spins,
        firing the flamethrower.  Nothing there.  She whirls
        back.  Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized.

        Skeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre
        tormented positions like human insects in amber.
        Steam blasts, blinding her.  The locator signal
        strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low
        passage, turns again.  At each intersection she quickly
        lights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it.
        For the way back.  She has to turn sideways, inching
        through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon
        niches, human bas-relief sealed in resin.

        SUDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER!  A hand.
        She recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in
        the wall.  Carter Burke.

                                  BURKE
                   Ripley...help me.  I can feel
                   it...inside.  Oh, God...it's
                   moving!  Oh gooood...

        She looks at him.  No one deserves this.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here.

        She hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around
        the spoon, and pulls the primer.  She moves on.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have eleven minutes to
                   reach minimum safe distance.

        Ripley moves ahead.  The locator signals shows she is
        almost there.  A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an
        earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet.  Then
        another.  The whole station seems to shudder.  A SIREN
        begins to wail a demented rhythm.  Following the tracker
        she turns a corner and stops.  The RANGE INDICATOR READS
        ZERO.  She looks down, horrified to see Newt's tracer
        bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel.  All hope
        recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        173

        Newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the
        edge of a cluster of upright OVOID SHAPES...alien
        eggs.  Her eyelids flutter open and she becomes
        aware of her surroundings.  The egg nearest her
        begins to move...opening like an obscene flower at
        its top to reveal something stirring within.  Newt
        stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs
        appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one.  She
        SCREAMS.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          174

        Ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        175

        Newt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn toward
        her.  Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap,
        and FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assault
        rifle.  The flash illuminates the figure of an
        adult warrior, nearby.  It spins, moving straight
        for Ripley.  Firing from the hip she drills it with
        two controlled bursts which catapult it back.  She
        steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN.  Her expression is
        murderous.  AND AGAIN.  It spins onto its back.
        She unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in
        a fireball.  Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearing
        at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the
        child.  She swings her up onto her back.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   I knew you'd come.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Newt, I want you to hang on,
                   now.  Hang on tight.

        Groggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts
        of Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up her
        weapon.  More warriors are moving toward her among
        the eggs.  She fires the flamethrower.  The eggs are
        engulfed.  One of the warriors lunges forward, a
        living fireball.  She blasts it in half with two
        bursts from the M-41A.  Ripley retreats, ducking under
        a glistening cylindrical mass.  A PIERCING SHRIEK
        fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is.

        A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN
        glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black
        insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the
        Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable
        horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two
        powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her
        distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells
        and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended
        from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
        membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
        carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes
        she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside
        the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless
        eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor
        where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by
        DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
        of the "warrior" aliens we have already seen.

        Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She
        fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The
        grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE,
        ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous
        matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes
        berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle.
        Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting
        everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel
        in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones
        vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's
        shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two
        warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on
        her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL
        COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the
        magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home
        and OPENS UP.

        The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes.  Ripley
        backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy
        of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one
        long eye-searing expenditure of energy.  Then she
        dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal
        instinct.

        INT. CATACOMBS                                          176

        Ripley runs, blindly, with panting intensity verging
        on hysteria.  Impressions crash upon her...the maze
        blurring by, sirens howling, the station rocking with
        explosions, emergency lights flashing, steam blasting,
        red-hot steel hissing.  Reality itself is reduced to
        a concussive series of strobelike instants of
        relentless forward motion.

        She sees one of the flares she dropped and turns.
        Sees another, sprinting toward it as the foundations
        of the world shake.

        INT. EGG CHAMBER                                        177

        Lashing in a frenzy, the QUEEN DETACHES FROM THE EGG
        SAC, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and
        tissue behind it.  SEEN DIMLY THROUGH swirling smoke,
        it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward.

        INT. CATACOMBS - CORRIDOR                               178-
                                                                179

        Ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing
        bursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors at
        indistinct shapes and shadows.  The weapon is empty
        when she reaches the freight elevators.  A mass of
        debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level,
        has demolished the life cage she descended in.  She
        slams the control for the other cage and hears the
        sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its
        slow descent from several levels up.  AN ENRAGED
        SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor.  Ripley sees a
        silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black
        shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE
        QUEEN.  Her last cartridge is reading zeroes.  The
        flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that.
        The grenades are gone.  Ripley drops the weapon and
        looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at
        the approaching FIGURE.  The elevator won't be in time.
        She runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous
        screech beats in her ears.  She scrambles up the
        rungs.

        INT. SECOND LEVEL                                       180

        Ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch, Newt
        clinging to her.  She dives aside as a POWERFUL
        BLACK ARM shoots up through the opening, its
        razor claws slamming into the grille-floor inches
        from her.  Looking down through the grille she
        sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her,
        wet and leering.  She scrambles up, running, as
        the grille-floor lifts and buckles behind her
        with the titanic force of the creature below.
        It hurls itself with insane ferocity against the
        metal, pacing her from below as she runs.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          181

        Ripley reaches an open-grid emergency stairwell and
        sprints upward.  It rocks and shudders with the
        station's death throes.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have two minutes
                   to reach minimum safe
                   distance.

        INT. CORRIDOR - ELEVATORS                               182-
                                                                183

        The lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open.
        The Queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating
        the open lift cage.

        INT. STAIRWELL                                          184

        Ripley stumbles, smashing her knees against the
        metals stairs.  As she rises she hears the LIFT
        MOTORS start up.  Looking down through the lattice
        work of the station she sees the life cage start
        ominously upward.  She knows there is only one
        explanation for that.  She runs on, the stairwell
        becoming a crazy whirl around her.

        EXT. LANDING PLATFORM                                   185

        Ripley, with Newt still clinging to her, slams
        through the door opening onto the platform.
        Through wind-whipped streamers of smoke she
        sees...THE SHIP IS GONE.

                                  RIPLEY
                   BISHOP!

        Her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred,
        outrage at the final betrayal.  She scans the sky.
        Nothing.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (hysterical)
                   BISHOP!

        Newt is sobbing.

        The lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW.  Ripley turns,
        backing away from the doors toward the railing.  There
        is no place to run to on the platform.  EXPLOSIONS
        detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs
        swell upward through the machinery.  The platform bucks
        wildly.  Nearby a cooling tower collapses with a
        THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL.  More
        EXPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below.
        Ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops.  The
        safety cage parts.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt; low)
                   Close your eyes, baby.

        The lift doors begin to open.  A glimpse of the
        apparition within.

        ANGLE ON RIPLEY AND NEWT  as the drop-ship RISES RIGHT
        BEHIND THEM, its hovering jets roaring.

                                  VOICE
                   You now have thirty seconds to
                   reach...

        Ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from
        the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship.  A
        TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby,
        slamming the ship sideways.  Its extended landing legs
        foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous
        squeal of metal on metal.

        INT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION                           186-
                                                                187

        Ripley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her.  Begins
        strapping in.  Bishop wrestles with the controls.  The
        landing legs retract, ripping free.  Ripley slams her
        seat harness latches home.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Punch it, Bishop!

        The entire lower level of the station disappears in a
        fireball.  The air vibrates with intense heat waves and
        concussion.  The drop-ship engines fire.  Ripley is
        slammed back in her seat.  The ship vaults out and up,
        Bishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees.
        Ripley and Newt see everything shake into a blur.

        EXT. STRATOSPHERE                                       188

        The drop-ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into
        the clear high night.  Below, the clouds light up from
        beneath from horizon to horizon.

        A SUN HOT DOME OF ENERGY bursts up through the cloud
        layer, WHITING OUT THE FRAME.  The tiny ship is slammed
        by the shockwave, tossed forward...and climbs, scorched
        but functioning, toward the stars.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          189

        Ripley and Newt watch the blinding glare fade away and
        they sit, wide-eyed, trembling, realizing they are
        finally and truly safe.  Newt starts to cry quietly,
        and Ripley strokes her hair.

                                  RIPLEY
                   It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's
                   over.

        INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT - LATER               190

        The scorched and battered ship once again sits in its
        drop-bay, steam blasting from cooling vents beside the
        engine.  Rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber
        hypnotically.

        INT. DROP-SHIP                                          191

        Bishop stands behind Ripley as she kneels beside a
        comatose Hicks.

                                  BISHOP
                   I gave him a shot, for the pain.
                   We'll need to get a stretcher to
                   cart him up to medical.

        Ripley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop down
        the aisle to the loading ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I'm sorry if I gave you a scare
                   but that platform was just becoming
                   too unstable...

        INT. CARGO LOCK - DROP-SHIP                             192

        Bishop continues as they move down the ramp.

                                  BISHOP
                   I had to circle and hope things
                   didn't get too rough to take you
                   off.

        Ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp.
        She puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                  RIPLEY
                   You did okay, Bishop.

                                  BISHOP
                   Well, thanks, I --

        He notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the
        ramp next to his shoe.  SSSSSS.  Acid.  SOMETHING BURSTS
        FROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood.
        It is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN.
        Driven right through him from behind.  Bishop thrashes,
        seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is
        slowly lifts him off the deck.  Above them the Queen
        glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic
        mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay.  It blends perfectly
        with the machinery until it begins to emerge.  Seizing
        Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him
        aside, shredded, like a doll.  It descends slowly to the
        deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black
        limbs, dripping acid and rage.  Still smoking where Ripley
        half-fried it.  The Queen is huge, powerful...and very
        pissed off.  It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in
        inhuman geometries.

        Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring
        hypnotized...terrified to break and run.  She lowers Newt
        to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (to Newt)
                   Go!

        Newt runs for cover.  The Alien drops to the deck, pivoting
        toward the motion.  Ripley waves her arms, decoying.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Here!

        Without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her.
        Ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her.
        Its feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her.  She clears
        a door.  Hits the switch.  It WHIRRS closed.  BOOM.  The
        Alien hits a moment later.

        INT. DARK CHAMBER                                       193

        Ripley moves ferret-quick among dark, unrecognizable
        machines.

        VARIOUS ANGLES  VERY TIGHT ON what she is doing...her feet
        going into stirruplike mechanisms.  Velcro straps
        fastened over them.  Fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence.
        Her hand closing on a complex grip-control.  The HUM of
        powerful motors.  The WHINE of hydraulics.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         194

        The Queen turns its attention from the doors to Newt as
        the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike
        service channels which cross the deck.  The channels are
        covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her
        to crawl through.

        INT. CHANNEL                                            195

        Newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the
        Alien appears above, seen through the bars.  A section of
        grille is ripped away behind her.  She scrambles
        desperately.  Another section is ripped away right at her
        heels.  Light pouring in.  The next will be right above
        her.

        INT. CARGO LOCK                                         196

        The Queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her.
        The parting doors REVEAL an inhuman silhouette standing
        there.

        Ripley steps out, WEARING TWO TONS OF HARDENED STEEL.
        THE POWER LOADER.  Like medieval armor with the power of
        a bulldozer.  She takes a step...the massive foot
        CRASH-CLANGS to the deck.  She takes another, advancing.

        Ripley's expression is one you hope you'll never see...
        Hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her
        child and that primal, murderous rage surges through her
        now, banishing all fear.

                                  RIPLEY
                   Get away from her, you bitch!

        The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality and leaps.

        WALLOP!  A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches
        it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall.  It
        rebounds into a massive backhand.  CRASH!  It goes
        backward into heavy loading equipment.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (screaming)
                   Come on!

        The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with
        unbelievable fury.  The battle is joined.

        Claws swipe, tail lashes.  Ripley parries with radical
        swipes of the steel forks.  They circle in a whirling
        blur, demolishing everything in their path.  The cavernous
        chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...WHINE, CRASH,
        CLANG, SCREECH.

        They lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks,
        crushing two of the creature's limbs.  It lashes and
        writhes with incredible fury, coming within inches of her
        exposed body.  She lifts it off the ground.  The hind
        legs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, denting
        it in.  The striking teeth extend almost a meter from
        inside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash-bars.
        She ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion
        behind her dead in a spray of drool.  Yellow acid foams
        down the hydraulic arms toward her.  The creature rips
        at high-pressure hoses.  Purple hydraulic fluid sprays
        ...machine blood mixing with alien blood.  They topple,
        off balance.  The Queen pins her.  Ripley hits a switch.
        The power loader's CUTTING TORCH flares on, directly in
        the thing's face.  They roll together, over the lip of
        a RECTANGULAR PIT, A VERTICAL LOADING AIRLOCK.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       197

        They crash together four meters below, twisted in the
        loader's wreckage.  The Alien shrieks, pinned.

        Ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader
        and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons.
        She slaps the red "INNER DOOR OVERRIDE" and latches the
        "HOLD" locking-key down.  A KLAXON begins to sound.  She
        hits "OUTER DOOR OPEN" and there is a hurricane shriek of
        air as the doors on which they are lying separate,
        REVEALING the infinite pit of stars, below.

        All this time the Alien has been lashing at her in a
        frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the
        confined space.  The airlock becomes a wind tunnel,
        blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap
        from the loader.  The air of the vast ship howls past her
        into space as she claws her way up a service ladder.

        INT. CARGO BAY                                          198

        Newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across
        the floor toward the airlock.   Bishop, torn virtually in
        two, his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind,
        grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for Newt as she
        slides past him.  He catches her arm and hangs on as she
        dangles, doll-like, in the airblast.

        INT. LOADING LOCK                                       199

        The Alien seizes Ripley's ankle.  She locks her arms
        around a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of
        their shoulder sockets.

        The door opens farther, all of space yawning below.  The
        loader tumbles clear, falling away.  It drags the Alien,
        still clutching one of Ripley's lucky hi-tops, into the
        depths of space.  Its SHRIEK fades, it gone.

        With all her strength Ripley fights the blasting air,
        crawling over the lip of the inner doorway.  She releases
        the OVERRIDE from a second panel.  The inner doors close.
        The turbulent air eddies and settles.

        She lies on her back, drained of all strength.  Gasping
        for breath.  Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bishop
        still holding Newt by the arm.  Encrusted with his own
        vanilla milkshake blood.  Bishop gives her a small, grim
        smile.

                                  BISHOP
                   Not bad for a human.

        He winks.

        Ripley crosses to Newt.

                                  NEWT
                          (weakly)
                   Mommy...Mommy?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Right here, baby.  Right here.

        Ripley hugs her desperately.

        INT. CORRIDOR                                           200

        Ripley limps along the corridor, carrying Newt on her hip.
        The ship's systems hum comfortingly.  Newt's head rests
        on her shoulder.

                                  NEWT
                   Are we going to sleep now?

                                  RIPLEY
                   That's right.

                                  NEWT
                   Can we dream?

                                  RIPLEY
                   Yes, honey.  I think we both can.

        HOLD ON THEM AS they recede down the long straight
        corridor.

                                                         FADE OUT

   
                               THE END

INT. ARCADE WORLD -- ELECTRONIC DARKNESS

We don't know if it's night or day.  It's just black.

And maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by.  So quick we barely
perceive them.  Like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed.

BREATHING,

slow and hollow, filling up the entire world.  It's eerie as hell.  A
feeling of utter loneliness.

And now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness.  Whatever it
was...it's gone now.

MAIN CREDITS ROLL.

We hear CELLOS.  Four of them.  Weaving an intricate melody.

And now the visuals.  BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in.  Equally
intricate, matching the music.  They grow and flourish, like flowers
opening up in time lapse photography.

FRACTALS...

is what they're called.  The visual manifestation of geometric formulas.
The Mandelbrot Set.  The Julia Set.  Each mathematic form made up of
progressively smaller forms and on into infinity.

Glorious and beautiful.  Forms folding in upon themselves and
regenerating.

This is creation we're witnessing.

This is life in the making.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

AN EYE

For a brief moment we still hear the CELLOS.  And in the eye, the last of
the fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris.  A nice blue
one.  This is ALEX MANNING'S eye.

				ALEX (V.O.)
		Time.  That's all I ever think about
		anymore.  It's like there's never enough of
		it, you know?

								CUT TO:

INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY

This is a flashback, in case you're wondering.  We'll continue to hear
Alex's VOICE as we move through the house in slow motion.  Everything is
very bright and dreamlike.

Right now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway.
At the end of the hallway is an open door.

We stop at the doorway.  We're afraid to go in.

				ALEX (V.O.)
		It's strange.  When the future's in front
		of you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean,
		you never really get there.  It's always
		one step ahead of you.  It's like there's
		no present. There's no "now".  As soon as
		you think, "I'm here", the moment's already
		gone.  Either everything's in the future,
		or it's in the past.
			(beat)
		There's no "now".

				MAN (V.O.)
		So where are you then?

				ALEX (V.O.)
		I'm in the past.

We move through the doorway.

INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

Everything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight
streaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.
Everything looks perfect.

Then we move further in, and over to the right.  There's something on the
floor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom.  Halfway in, halfway
out.

It's a woman's body.  She's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent.  We
can't see her face from this angle. But in her limp hand is a gun.  And
all around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom
and the carpeting beyond, is BLOOD.

A shrill BELL shatters the moment.

								CUT TO:

INT.  COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

The bell continues.  It's a school bell signaling the end of the period.

ON ALEX

as we see her for the first time, startled.  She's seventeen and pretty,
though in a simple way.  Her eyes are the most striking.  Deep.  Intense.
If Alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's
reflected in her eyes.

Across from her is MR. WEAVER, a high-school guidance counselor and that
was his voice we heard with Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged,
incapable of really hearing what Alex has to say.  This is his office
we're in. Typical "SAY NO TO DRUGS" teen propaganda decorate the room.
Fun.

As the BELL dies we hear the army of FOOTSTEPS outside, students milling
in the halls.

Alex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair.

				MR. WEAVER
		We don't have to stop now...

				ALEX
			(cutting him off)
		That's okay.  I've got a test coming up
		anyway.  Gotta study.

				MR. WEAVER
			(sighs)
		I have to tell you, I'm a little concerned
		about you, Alex.  It's been three months
		now since your mother, uh...

				ALEX
			(offering, fixing him with
			a stare)
		Killed herself?

Mr. Weaver stops, more than a little uncomfortable.

				MR. WEAVER
			(reluctant)
		Yes.  Now your father...

				ALEX
		He's a basket case.  You've talked to him.
		You know that.  He might as well be dead
		too.

Alex glances down at the floor, anything to avoid looking at the
counselor.  She heaves a backpack onto to shoulder.

				ALEX
			(continuing)
		Look Mr. Weaver, I don't even know why I
		came here.  I fine.  Really.
			(looking up)
		It's like I said.  It's just part of the
		past now.  It doesn't matter anymore.

She turns, and before Mr. Weaver can respond, she's out the door.

INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Alex moves quickly through the mass of STUDENTS, wiping the remnants of
half-tears on her coat sleeve.

								CUT TO:

INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

Fun-time.  Total chaos.  If you've been to high-school you know the riff.
Bad food, teen-age melodrama, and a squadron of SUPERVISORS trying to keep
a lid on things.

ALEX

makes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kids
lounge around a table.  These are Alex's FRIENDS.  And while none of them
are your garden variety pocket-protector-type nerds, these kids aren't
exactly part of the "in-crowd".  They're a little off.  Quirky.  All of
them come from screwed up families, and that's what bonds them.  They are:

GREG HOLLISTON -- Alex's boyfriend.  Hopeful artist (not bad, either) and
kind of punk looking.  Greg and the others are big fans of thrift-shop
clothing.  Because they don't have the money, they improvise.

NICK DRAKE -- Greg's best friend and future computer pioneer.  He's
attractive and he's got an edge.  A bit of a hot-shot.  Genius in the
making.

BENZ AND STILTS -- Inseparable.  Benz is flunking out of school and would
like nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comic
books.  He's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, and nervous.  Stilts,
contrary to his nickname, is quite short and never without his skateboard.
Stilts is constantly hitting on...

LAURIE -- The sixth member of the group.  A teen Theda Bara and as cynical
as you can get.  She's what's affectionately known as an "art chick".

The boys in the group, particularly Nick and Stilts, are avid
skateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards.  Stilts is always
leafing through an issue of THRASHER magazine.

Right now the group is in the midst of an argument.  Nick has a pocket
video game in his hands which he casually plays.  He can get through these
games in his sleep.  It BEEPS and WHIRS.

				NICK
			(to Benz)
		You're an idiot, you know that? What're you
		going to do when you get out of here?

				BENZ
		I was thinking about writing for one of
		those Filipino mail order brides...

Stilts and Greg burst into laughter.

				STILTS
		I think I saw that on the Home Shopping
		Network.  The Girlfriend Hour, right after
		Auto Accessories.

				BENZ
			(giggling)
		Exactly.

				LAURIE
		You guys are sick.

Alex flops down in a chair and everyone turns.

				GREG
		So how'd it go?

Alex shrugs, trying to make light of it.

				ALEX
		He thinks I'm "sublimating".

				STILTS
		What the hell does that mean?

				LAURIE
		It means she's screwed up.

				STILTS
		Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.

				BENZ
		You are fucked up.

				STILTS
		Yeah, but only because I want to be.

				GREG
		Would you guys knock it off?

Greg turns back to Alex and looks her in the eye.

				GREG
			(continuing)
		Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's
		don't know anything.  They're full of shit.
		If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect
		kid, they freak.

				ALEX
			(nodding)
		I know.

				GREG
		So tell me you're okay, then.

				ALEX
		I'm okay.

				GREG
			(smiles)
		Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.


Greg leans over and kisses Alex.  The rest of the group launches into
exaggerated GROANS, with Benz and Stilts fluttering their eyes and making
"smooching faces" at each other.  The kiss is over and everyone LAUGHS.

Things are okay now.

				GREG
			(to Alex)
		Hey...watch this...

Greg pulls an old Polaroid camera from his backpack.  He leans in close to
her and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them.  FLASH!
And the moment's captured forever.

Greg pulls the Polaroid out and peels off the backing. Before the picture
even develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the
emulsion.

				NICK
			(engrossed in his game
			again)
		You making another one, Greg?

				GREG
		Sure.  Practice.

				BENZ
		Lemme see...

Greg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to Benz.
The papers are color xeroxes of Polaroid blow-ups.  Greg has messed with
them, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images.  Stilts and
Laurie lean in.

				STILTS
		Cool.

				GREG
			(still working)
		See, when the emulsion's still warm you can
		move it around...
			(stops)
		There.

Greg holds up the Polaroid for Alex to see.

POLAROID

Greg and Alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world has
spun into strange colors.  It's an odd effect.

Greg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it.

				GREG
		Safe keeping.

Meanwhile, Nick's pocket video game emits an EXPLOSION NOISE.

				NICK
		Shit.  I'm out.

He sets the game down, dejected.

				BENZ
		You guys going to Dante's after school?

				GREG
		I don't know.

				BENZ
		Check it out...

Benz pulls a flyer from inside his coat.  It's an ad for a new game called
"ARCADE", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a
circuit board.  The tag at the bottom reads, "COMING THIS FALL.  REALITY
WILL NEVER BE THE SAME".

				NICK
			(excited)
		That's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys
		are good.  It's supposed to be interactive.
		Graphics are unbelievable.

				BENZ
		Yeah?  They were handing these out at
		Dante's.  Test marketing it or something.
		Gonna have a demonstration today.

				STILTS
		Cool.

				LAURIE
		Can you say anything but "cool"?

				STILTS
		Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of
		things...

				GREG
			(annoyed)
		Guys...


Benz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again.

				BENZ
		So how 'bout it?

				NICK
		I'm game...
			(to Greg)
		Greg?

Greg turns to Alex.

				GREG
		Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school,
		try the game out, maybe get some dinner.

				ALEX
		And then keep on driving?

				GREG
		Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.

				LAURIE
			(nodding)
		I could go for that.

Alex laughs.  Laurie took the words right out of her mouth.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY

The Inferno is a run-down video arcade near the beach, notable because the
games it sports are generally defective and out of date.  Nevertheless,
it's become our group's hang-out.  It has its charms.

A huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of the
arcade...something straight out of Hieronymus Bosch. Demons in day-glo.
The yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.

ALEX AND THE OTHERS

pull up across the street, caravan style.  Greg and Alex are in one
car...an ancient Buick Skylark.  No Honda Accords or VW Rabbits for this
group.

At the moment, there's quite a bit of activity at the Inferno's entrance.
KIDS are clustered around and Slip-Stream employees are passing out Arcade
promo sheets.

THE GROUP

heads for the entrance, plowing their way through the crowd.  Stilts and
Benz have their skateboards, jumping up onto the curb with them, then
popping them up into their arms.

INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY

Inside, the Inferno is a mishmash of video games, ancient carnival props
and old horror movie posters.  Dusty, creepy under the right circumstances
and filled with leering faces...  in short, any kid's bedroom taken to a
horrific extreme.  At Dante's Inferno, they've got the latest games side
by side with chestnuts like Pac-Man.

THE GROUP

makes their way inside, joining a cluster of KIDS in the center of The
Inferno.  And there it is...

ARCADE

It looks out of place in the midst of The Inferno.  Shiny black,
high-tech, and almost self-contained, like some sort of space-age vertical
coffin.  Laser-etched graphics on the sides bear the ARCADE logo and the
same strange, frightening face.

Alex and her friends are suitably impressed, most notably, Nick and Benz.

				BENZ
		Check it out...

				STILTS
		Definitely cool.

Nick is silent, letting his eyes explore the machine.  He turns to Greg
and grins.

				NICK
		Super computers, micro-processors... That's
		the future we're looking at.

Another kid, DELOACH, pushes his way to the front of the group.  His
fighting a losing battle against acne.

				DELOACH
			(looking around)
		So how come they're previewing it in this
		shit-hole?

				STILTS
		If you weren't such a dick, you'd know what
		a cool place this was.

				DELOACH
		Gimme a break, they got fucking Space
		Invaders here.  That's shit's for retards.

				STILTS
		So...are you trying to say I'm retarded?
		Is that what you're implying?

				DELOACH
		No, but since I'm standing here, I'm
		noticing that you're an ugly little fuck
		and you're making me sick...

That's it for Stilts.  He launches himself at DeLoach, catching him off
guard and KNOCKING him to the floor.

Nick, Alex, and Greg are on them in a minute, trying to extract the two
from each other.

A LARGE MAN

pushes his way towards them and effortlessly scoops both boys up, wrapping
a beefy hand around the scruffs of their necks.  This is FINSTER, the
proprietor...enormous, bald, and always irritable.

				FINSTER
			(shaking them)
		Cut it out!!!

His face contorts and he spits as he speaks.  Nice guy. Alex steps
forward, always the voice of reason.

				ALEX
		It's okay, Mr. Finster...

				FINSTER
		No it's not.
			(to the boys)
		You guys are shits and I'm throwing you out.

				DELOACH
			(acting tough)
		Your place sucks.  Who gives a shit about
		"ARCADE" anyway?

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(booming, metallic)
		WHAT DID YOU SAY?

Everyone turns.  The voice came from...

ARCADE

It's up and running now.  The inside panel emits an eerie green light.
From speakers inside the compartment we can here BREATHING...the same
breathing we heard earlier. Coming from a machine like this, it's creepy
as hell.

Even Finster is impressed.  He releases the boys and stares at the
machine.

				LAURIE
			(a whisper)
		Jesus...

				ANOTHER VOICE (O.S.)
		Not bad, huh?

A MAN steps out from behind the ARCADE machine.  He grins happily, dressed
to kill, sporting a SLIP-STREAM ID tag. This is DIFFORD, P.R. man for
SLIP-STREAM.

				DIFFORD
		Hi, kids.
			(nods)
		Mr. Finster...

The ARCADE machine continues to breathe, inhale, exhale... The eyes in the
face are glowing now, in unison with the breathing.

Difford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod.

				DIFFORD
			(smooth as silk)
		We're glad you people could make it, and
		we're anxious to have you try out our new
		product.  We think it's going to be a big
		seller.  But you're the people that make it
		happen.  You're the market share everyone's
		tearing each other apart to get at.  It's
		your opinion that's going to make or break
		us.

				NICK
		So what's so different about Arcade? You
		guys've been talking about it for months.

Difford turns to Nick and salutes him.

				DIFFORD
		A man after my own heart.  Straight to the
		point.
			(to everyone)
		What's different about ARCADE is the way it
		reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It
		learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it
		changes its strategy.

				NICK
		That's impossible.

				DIFFORD
			(taking the bait)
		Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?

Difford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter.  He tosses
it at...

NICK

who snags it out of mid-air and grins.

				GREG
		Go for it, Nick.

Difford steps aside and waves Nick to the machine.  The rest of the kids
crowd around.

ARCADE

isn't just your typical video game.  First of all there are three
screens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view while
playing.  Second, the player wears "data gloves" (which provide an actual
sensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired
directly into the machine.  The results give the user the feeling that
he/she has actually entered the video game universe.

Difford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows.

				DIFFORD
			(indicating equipment)
		The CyberGloves are keyed into the game's
		response mechanism.  You'll be able to pick
		things up inside the world...tools, weapons
		... it'll feel like they're really in your
		hands...

Nick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps.

				DIFFORD
			(continuing)
		The goggles heighten the experience. When
		we said "Reality will never be the same",
		we weren't kidding.

Difford places the goggles on Nick's face.  Then he points to the control
board, which features two joy-sticks and a large RED BUTTON labeled
"ESCAPE".

				NICK
			(skeptical)
		"Escape"?

				DIFFORD
		In case things get too intense.  It
		automatically freezes the game, gives you a
		breather.  Things can get pretty wild...

				BENZ
			(scoffing)
		Nick won't need it.

				DIFFORD
		You're good, eh?

				NICK
			(grins)
		The best.

Nick winks at Alex and Greg.

				NICK
			(to Difford)
		So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a
		princess?  Fighting Zombies?

				DIFFORD
		It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each
		one is a different layer of the ARCADE
		universe.  The concept is, you're entering
		the video game itself, making your way
		across the circuit board to the logic core
		... ARCADE's brain.

				NICK
		So how do I start?

				DIFFORD
		The game will guide you.

Nick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot.
He punches the "START" button on the top of one of the joy-sticks.

Immediately the screens come to life.  Darkness with shooting stars of
light racing back and forth.

ON SCREEN

A three-dimensional computer-generated FACE appears out of the darkness,
spinning in from far away and coming to rest.

				ARCADE
		I AM ARCADE.
			(breathing)
		YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES?  YOU PICKED THE
		WRONG MACHINE.

The crowd of kids is suitably impressed.  Even Alex is amused.
So far, so good.

				ARCADE
		WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

				NICK
		Nick.

				ARCADE
			(almost contemptuous)
		NICK.  KISS REALITY GOODBYE.

SUDDENLY,

A LIGHTBEAM above the video screen illuminates Nick's face.

				LAURIE
			(concerned)
		What's it doing?!

				DIFFORD
		Memorizing Nick's features.  Watch.

ON SCREEN

the face of ARCADE spins away and a computer-generated figure appears,
complete with a pixel-rendered version of Nick's face!

VIDEO NICK

is dressed in futuristic armor with exaggerated CyberGloves and a full
helmet on instead of goggles.  He also wears elbow and knee pads and
carries a thrasher in his hands, sort of a cross between a souped-up
skateboard and the Silver Surfer's board.  It's his means of
transportation.

The screen prints out:  "NICK.  ENTER THE VORTEX".

VIDEO NICK

hops onto the thrasher.  Abruptly the world around him begins to spin, and
Video Nick is shooting a curl, a whirlpool of light...down, down, faster
and faster, until...

BOOM!  Empty space and video Nick is falling towards a circuit grid.  It's
the electronic universe rushing up to meet him...

				ARCADE
		ONE WORD OF ADVICE, NICK.  YOU SPEND TOO
		MUCH TIME IN ONE PLACE, AND I SEND OUT THE
		SCREAMER.  YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND WHEN
		THAT HAPPENS.
			(laughs)
		SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

ON SCREEN

Video Nick plummets from the sky like a meteor, slamming into the ground
with an explosion of dust.  The dust clears.

Video Nick is standing on an eerie plain, with strange reed-like plants
dotting the ground and mist coiling around everything.  It looks like
Earth, and yet...it doesn't.

VIDEO NICK

hops onto the thrasher and begins to move.  And move it does.  With a
WHOOP! the ARCADE world is rushing past us. The game has begun.

ON NICK'S FACE

As a smile gradually creeps across it.  He's having the time of his life,
gloved hands manipulating the joy-sticks like mad.  From his reactions, we
can tell that this is one of the most incredible things he's ever
experienced.

THE OTHER KIDS

watch Nick, then the screen, then Nick again...

				BENZ
		Check it out!

				GREG
		Come on, Nick...

Now everyone is laughing, urging Nick on.  It's like they've all
discovered the most amazing toy...something that's going to turn their
world upset down.

DIFFORD

is pleased as punch, watching the kids' reactions more than the game.

ON SCREEN

Images are rushing past at blinding speed, LASERS, EXPLOSIONS, and god
knows what...

ON NICK

As sweat begins to trickle down his fast.  His hands move faster and
faster, in response to the game.

The screen.

Nick.

The screen and...

BAM!!!  Nick SLAMS down the escape button and rips off his goggles.  The
video image freezes.

NICK

He's practically hyperventilating, sweat pouring down his face.  He leans
over, resting a hand on the control board. And for a moment, everyone is
silent.  Then...

				GREG
		Nick...you okay?

Slowly, Nick lifts his head.  He's now sporting a devilish grin.

				NICK
		You gotta try this thing.

Nick pulls off his CyberGloves and holds them out for Greg. Greg turns to
Alex.

				ALEX
		Go for it.

				GREG
		Hold my keys, then.

He hands her his keychain and takes the CyberGloves from Nick.  Greg pulls
them on, then straps on the goggles.

				GREG
			(to Difford)
		So how do I get back in?

				DIFFORD
		Just hit "ESCAPE" again.

ON SCREEN

Greg hits the button and immediately the image unfreezes. Once again,
we're on the thrasher board, rushing across the plains.

GREG'S FACE

As a smile slowly creeps across it.

								CUT TO:

INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - LATER

At the front of The Inferno, Difford and two SLIP-STREAM HELPERS are
unpacking cardboard boxes.  The KIDS have clustered around them,
momentarily forgetting the ARCADE machine.

Difford pulls cut a handful of game cartridges as well as goggles which
dangle over his arm.

				DIFFORD
		Here's what we're going to do.  What I'm
		holding are the home versions of ARCADE,
		the prototypes...

This is met with an enthusiastic response from the kids.

				DIFFORD
			(continuing)
		In a month or so we're planning on releasing
		ARCADE in both versions, but we're still
		fine tuning, and that's where you guys luck
		out.  So what we'll do is have you register
		with us, and then we're going to loan these
		out to you for a week or so.  The only thing
		you have to do in return is answer some
		marketing questions. Sound fair?

The kids can't line up fast enough.

OUR GROUP

is right up front, with Nick and Alex being the first two in line.

Difford winks at Nick.

				DIFFORD
		So what do you think?

				NICK
		Sign me up.

Alex is glancing around now.  She sees Benz, Stilts, and Laurie, but not
Greg.

				ALEX
		Where's Greg?

Laurie jerks her thumb back at the ARCADE machine.

				LAURIE
		He's still working on the game.

And Alex finds Greg for a moment, spotting him over the heads of the other
kids.

ON GREG

His face is a mirror of Nick's...sweat pouring down, grinning from ear to
ear.  It's addictive as hell.  SIGHTS and SOUNDS rush past us on the three
screens, racing at incredible speeds.

And now, from within the game, we hear a strange sound...a SCREAM of
sorts, halfway between a shriek and a sonic boom.

				ARCADE
		TIME'S UP, FRIEND.

The SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM reaches a nightmarish pitch and suddenly the screens
EXPLODE WITH LIGHT.

AT THE FRONT OF THE INFERNO...

everyone turns in response.  It's as if someone set off a flashbulb.

ALEX

pushes her way back through the kids, making her way to the ARCADE
machine.

ARCADE

Greg is nowhere to be found.  In fact, the CyberGloves and goggles are
dangling from the control board, abandoned.

Alex turns to a nearby KID.

				ALEX
		Where's Greg?

The kid shrugs.

				KID
		Don't know.  I think I saw him walk out,
		but I'm not sure...

Alex isn't listening anymore.  She's staring at the floor of the ARCADE
machine.

GREG'S POLAROID

is on the floor...the photo of Greg and Alex which he manipulated.

Alex picks it up, glancing around.  She scans the faces of the crowd and
she doesn't see Greg anywhere.  She turns away.

ON SCREEN

A video figure is lying on the computer-generated ground. It sits up,
brushing dust from itself, and looks around. It faces us.  Only the image
isn't of Nick anymore.  It's VIDEO GREG now.

UP FRONT,

Alex has re-joined her friends.  The four of them are now clutching ARCADE
home versions in their arms, CyberGloves and all.  They look like kids on
Christmas Day.

				ALEX
		Has anyone seen Greg?

				STILTS
		He's probably outside.  You know how he is.
		Gets bored...

				NICK
		Yeah, outside.

Nick heads for the door with the rest of the group in tow.

								CUT TO:

EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY

Outside, Greg is still nowhere to be found.  Benz, Stilts, and Laurie have
piled into their car, waiting for Nick to take the wheel.

NICK AND ALEX

are up by Greg's Skylark.

				ALEX
		So where is he?

				NICK
		Guess he took off...  You have his keys,
		right?

Alex holds them up and gives them a shake.

				NICK
		Hmmm.  He said you were going to have
		dinner?

				ALEX
		Yeah...

				NICK
		So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's
		up to something...

				ALEX
			(cutting him off)
		But he was playing the game.  I mean, you
		saw him...

BEHIND THEM,

Laurie reaches over the seat and honks Nick's horn.  Laurie and the others
burst into LAUGHTER.  Stilts sets his skateboard on the street and rolls
it towards Nick.

BACK TO NICK AND ALEX

Nick stops the board with his foot and steps onto it, balancing.  He waves
to the others and turns back to Alex.

				NICK
		It's nothing, okay?  Just take his car home.
		He'll show up.

Nick tousles Alex's hair.  He shakes his ARCADE cartridge at her.

				NICK
		Don't worry about it.

And with that, Nick's off, rolling back to his car and leaping over the
door, skateboard and all.  Laurie and the others are still screaming with
laughter.

Nick hits the ignition and guns the car, pulling out with a dramatic
SCREECH and sailing off down the street.

ON ALEX

clutching Greg's car keys.  She glances on the front seat, where her own
ARCADE cartridge rests.

THE CARTRIDGE

has the same glowing eyes that were laser-etched on the machine inside The
Inferno.

				ALEX
		Fuck-you.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MANNING HOUSE -- NIGHT

The Manning place is your basic suburban ranch house, totally
unexceptional.  The lawn looks a little ragged and a pile of newspapers,
frayed and yellowing, have accumulated by the front door.  Inside, the
house is dark. Lonely.

ALEX

pulls up in Greg's Skylark, scooping the ARCADE kit into her arms.

								CUT TO:

INT.  MANNING HOUSE -- NIGHT

As Alex enters the dark house, we can hear WHISPERS coming from further
within.  It's a little creepy, but Alex seems unconcerned.

She negotiates her way through the darkened house, on into the den.

DEN -- FOLLOWING THROUGH

Dim, flickering LIGHT illuminates the den, casting long shadows across a
SLEEPING FIGURE on the couch.

This is Alex's father, JIM...hopelessly middle-aged and getting older by
the moment.  It's the t.v. that's doing the whispering.  CNN or something.
From what little we can see of the rest of the house, it looks like a
mess.

Alex bends down and jostles her father's shoulder.

				ALEX
		Dad...Dad...

Jim stirs, though barely.  He turns a sleepy face towards her, looking
gray and lifeless.

				JIM
		Yeah?

				ALEX
		Did Greg call, Dad?

Jim shakes his head and sinks back into the couch.

From Alex's attitude, it's obvious that this scene has played itself out
many times before.

				ALEX
		You should go to bed, Dad.

Jim waves a tired hand, dismissing her.

				JIM
		...am in bed...

				ALEX
			(standing back up)
		Yeah.

She turns and grabs a comforter that's bunched up at the end of the couch,
spreading it over her father.

ON THE T.V.

We're getting a de-saturated view of carnage...some sort of war going on
in some far-off land.

Alex grabs the remote and flicks the t.v. off, plunging the room into
darkness.

								CUT TO:

INT.  ALEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

STATIC.

Late-night t.v. static, filling up the entire screen.

WE PULL BACK,

revealing a television...and further back until we see Alex crouched
behind it in silhouette.  She's fiddling with wires back there and...

BLINK! Suddenly the SLIP-STREAM logo appears on the t.v. screen with nifty
computer graphics.  She's just hooked up the home version of ARCADE.  Alex
moves back to the front of the set.

ALEX'S ROOM

is her haven, a virtual library, filled with books which she loses herself
in.  They're stacked everywhere.

And puzzles too.  Half-assembled jig-saws.  Intricate things.  An Escher
print.  The descendants of Rubik's Cube. Boxes within boxes.  This is
Alex's life, what she retreats to.

A PHOTO

of Alex and her MOTHER sits by her bed, neglected and collecting dust.
We'll see her later.

CANDLES

or what's left of them, have dripped and spread across her night table.

ALEX

sits at the foot of her bed, facing her television. Slowly, she draws on
the CyberGloves, testing her fingers. Next, she pulls on the goggles.
Instead of a control panel, the home version has a control box, complete
with joy-stick and a mini "ESCAPE" button.

Alex fingers the "START" button on top of the joy-stick.

THE SCREEN

goes black, black with intermittent sparks.  And the BREATHING begins.

ARCADE'S FACE

appears in the black, a pin-point at first, spinning round and round and
growing larger.  It comes to a rest, eyes glowing.

				ARCADE
			(malevolent)
		HELLO, ALEX.

Alex jumps back, dropping the control box.  ARCADE continues to BREATHE.

				ALEX
		How ...

A thing BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the ARCADE terminal, playing over Alex's
face.

				ARCADE
		KISS REALITY GOODBYE.

ON SCREEN

ARCADE'S face spins away, to be replaced by a pixel-rendered image of
Alex, dressed in battle gear.

Video Alex sets her thrasher on the ground and mounts it.

				ALEX
			(both frightened and
			fascinated)
		Where's Greg?

And from the screen...

				ARCADE
		IN HERE, OF COURSE.

ON SCREEN,

the vortex of light EXPLODES around video Alex, twisting reality.  And
Alex is spinning round and round, plummeting towards...

THE CIRCUIT GRID

beneath her, a world of geometric shapes and light and... The words:
 "LEVEL ONE"  flash across the screen and we...

								CUT TO:

EXT. LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAY

Alex SLAMS into the ground, splashing up water and smoke alike.
We are inside ARCADE now, experiencing what Alex experiences.

THE PLAINS --

In many respects it looks like Earth.  Land, water, sky... Yet certain
things are off.  Small things, like the color of light, a sluggish
smoke-filled RED, or the occasional FLICKER OF LIGHTNING which races
beneath the cloud cover above.

ALEX

pulls herself up from the muck, brushing dirt and water from her face.
She coughs, totally disoriented.  Looks around.

Looks at herself.  She's wearing...

BATTLE GEAR

This is the real thing, as opposed to the cartoon version we saw Nick
wearing when he played the game before.  It's a cross between a
skateboarder's protective guardpads and full-blown armor.  A helmet rests
on her head, with a visor raised up.

Alex glances down and sees a thrasher board resting next to her.  (Note:
Depending on the terrain of each level, the thrasher board will adjust
itself...working as a skateboard, snowboard, or hover board).

ON ALEX'S RIGHT CYBERGLOVE

is an LED display.  In the upper left-hand corner it says "LEVEL ONE".  To
the right, two pulsing bars of light labeled "TIME ELAPSED" and
"STRENGTH".

At this very moment, the "TIME ELAPSED" bar is just shrinking away to
nothing.

BLINK!  Now it's gone.

No rest for the weary.

A SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM

is immediately heard on the horizon, and it's the most god-awful noise
we've ever heard.  It fills up the world.

ALEX

jerks her head up, terrified.

				ALEX
			(to herself, remembering)
		Screamer.

All around her, the world begins to vibrate...

SOMETHING

is rushing towards her now at an unbelievable speed.  The SHRIEK/SONIC
BOOM is deafening.  The world is shaking apart.

And suddenly the thing is upon her!

Alex SCREAMS.

								CUT TO:

INT.  ALEX'S ROOM - NIGHT

Alex flies back from the t.v. screen, violently ripping the goggles and
CyberGloves off.  But the SHRIEK is continuing and then she realizes
that...

The phone is RINGING.

Alex stops shaking.  The phone continues to RING.  She's back in her room.
Everything's fine.  Normal.

She glances at the game.

ON SCREEN

we see the black again, black with sparks racing past. Benign.

Alex reaches over and picks up the phone, all the while keeping her eyes
glued to the screen.

				ALEX
			(dry-mouthed)
		Hello?

				NICK (O.S.)
			(filtered)
		Hey, kid.

Alex clutches the phone, still shaking.

				ALEX
		Nick...

				NICK  (O.S.)
			(filtered)
		Have you played the game yet?  It's
		incredible!  I was just...

				ALEX
			(cutting him off)
		Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think
		the game has something to do with it.

				NICK (O.S.)
			(filtered)
		What the hell are you talking about?

Alex continues to watch the television screen, almost mesmerized by the
flickering sparks.  Her eyes begin to glaze over...

				NICK (O.S.)
			(filtered)
		You there?  Hello?

Alex snaps out of it, tearing her gaze from the screen

				ALEX
		I have to talk to you.

				NICK (O.S.)
			(filtered)
		We are talking...

				ALEX
		No, in person.  Now.

				NICK (O.S.)
			(filtered)
		It's twelve-thirty!

				ALEX
		I'm coming over.

Alex quickly hangs up the phone and moves back to the television.  She
reaches for the control box and hits the "OFF" switch.

Nothing happens.  Sparks continue to shoot across the screen.

Alex tries it again.  Same result.

				ALEX
		Shit...

Again and again she hits the button, but nothing is happening.

Alex reaches behind the t.v., grabs hold of the electrical cords, and
YANKS.

The fucking cord won't come out!

And then she hears it, an ELECTRONIC WHISPER, both seductive and horrific.

				ARCADE
		ALEX...

With all her might, Alex pulls on the cords. POP!  They fling out of the
t.v. and the screen goes dead.

Alex sits back against the wall for a moment, catching her breath and
trying to calm the rising hysteria within her.

				ALEX
			(to herself)
		Okay...don't think about it...
			(deep breath)
		Okay.

Alex stands up, grabbing her coat off the bed.

INT.  MANNING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Alex comes down the stairs, heading for the front door. Only she stops for
a moment...noticing the LIGHT.

ON THE COUCH,

her father is once again bathed in the blue light of the television.
STATIC WHISPERS, the same as before, are coming from the set.

Alex looks at her father.  He hasn't moved.  And yet, the t.v. is on once
again.

THE SCREEN

Blue static.  Unexceptional.  And a face?  Someone in the static?

Alex draws closer to the screen.  She can hear SOMETHING now, other than
static whispers.  Sounds kind of like a VOICE...

THE SCREEN

A definite, ghostly FACE is there.  It turns, looks at Alex (us) and it's
Greg.

				GREG
			(on screen, strange)
		Alex...

Alex jerks and SNAPS off the t.v., spooked as hell.  She stands in the
darkness and all but runs out of the house.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  MANNING HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex races to the Skylark and fumbles with the keys. Finally she gets it
right, guns the gas, and rips out of the driveway.

A STREETLIGHT

above is FLICKERING wildly.  Sputtering, HUMMING, casting strange shadows
across the street.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  NICK DRAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex has climbed up to the roof, using a wood pile stacked beside the
house as a boost.  Now she creeps towards a second-story window.

Behind her on the street (and this should be subtle, folks), another
STREETLIGHT is flickering.

WINDOW

It looks in on Nick's room.  Alex draws close and TAPS on the glass.

Nick appears immediately, grinning like an idiot.  He raises the window.

				NICK
		Alex, you don't know how long I've waited
		for this.

				ALEX
		Funny.

Alex climbs in.

INT.  NICK'S ROOM -- NIGHT

The room is an intricate shrine to Nick's obsession...computers and
computer-generated images.  An entire wall is covered with a collage of
cut-out pictures from magazines.  On his shelves are miniature
armatures...flexible models of human musculature.

And of course, there is Nick's computer set-up.

Even as Alex climbs down onto Nick's bed, she notices that his computer is
up and running...connected to the ARCADE home version.

				ALEX
		What's that?

Nick turns back to the computer monitor.

FRACTALS

(as seen earlier) are blossoming on the screen.

				NICK
		Isn't it amazing?  It's a sort of rest
		position in the game, when you're between
		levels.

Nick pulls Alex closer.  She's wary.  But Nick is suitably impressed,
excited even.

				NICK
			(continuing)
		They're fractals.  Visual representations
		of mathematic equations.  The game is
		totally brilliant.  I mean, look at it,
		it's like a DNA molecule or something...

And in truth, the fractals are beautiful.

Alex turns back to Nick.  And for the first time, Nick stops grinning.
It's clear that Alex is upset.

				ALEX
		Something weird's happening.

Nick sits down on his bed.

				NICK
		What do you mean by "weird"?

				ALEX
		Greg never came home.  A few hours is one
		thing, Nick, but this is different.
		Something's happened to him.

Alex glances at the computer monitor again.  On the lower right-hand side
is a little pulsing GREEN light, on and off, on and off, like a heartbeat.

				ALEX
		Can you turn off the game?

				NICK
		I'm in the middle of it...

				ALEX
			(upset)
		Turn if off!

Nick is taken aback, but he rises and turns off the computer all the same.

And this time, the game stays off.  Nick comes back to the bed.

				NICK
		Happy?

				ALEX
		No.
			(frustrated)
		Look, I know you're not going to believe me,
		but listen anyway...
			(carefully)
		I think the game's alive somehow.

The look on Nick's face says it all.  He moves to speak and she stops him.

				ALEX
			(continuing)
		No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up
		earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As
		soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my
		name.  How could it know?  And then, I
		asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In
		here".

				NICK
		Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's
		gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's
		in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's
		doing it...

				ALEX
			(insistent)
		It is.

				NICK
		How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's
		don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a
		good program, a brilliant program, it was
		designed so it would act as if it were
		alive, but it's not alive.

				ALEX
		So how did it know my name, then?

				NICK
			(shrugs)
		You imagined it.

Alex is furious.  She rises and begins pacing back and forth, voice
growing louder.  She draws in close.

				ALEX
		See, men always do this.  "Quiet down,
		honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not
		a fucking idiot, Nick!
			(screaming)
		I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!

				NICK
			(a strained whisper)
		Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.

Alex spins around and points at the computer monitor.

				ALEX
		There!

THE MONITOR

ARCADE is back on again, fractals unfolding and green monitor light
blinking.

ON NICK

Okay.  Alright.  This does throw him for a second.

				ALEX
		It turned itself back on, Nick.

				NICK
		No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or
		something.  It happens.

Nick crosses to the monitor and flips the "OFF" switch.  He tries it again
and again, but the game won't turn off.

				ALEX
		It's alive, Nick.  It's listening to us ...

Nick spins around, angry, maybe a little freaked out.

				NICK
		Just shut up!  Enough already, okay?

Silence for a moment.  Nick takes a deep breath.  Over-reacted.  After a
moment...

				NICK
		Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.

				ALEX
		Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...

Nick acquiesces.  He pulls out his phone and punches in a number.

				NICK
		I'll try Stilts.  He's got insomnia.

Nick and Alex watch each other in silence as the connection is made.  We
can faintly hear the phone RINGING.

No answer.

				NICK
		Okay...Laurie, then.

Alex turns away, sinking to Nick's bed.  All the anger has drained out of
her.  She knows they won't reach them.

ON NICK

As he listens for an answer.  Three RINGS, four, five... He hangs up.
Punches in the final number.

				NICK
		Benz...

Again.  No answer.

Nick hangs up and sets the phone aside.  He looks at Alex.

				ALEX
			(fatalistic)
		Something's happened to them.

				NICK
		It's the middle of the night.  They're
		asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.

				ALEX
		All of them?

Nick shrugs.  He's not willing to accept anything, but he's uncomfortable
all the same.

				NICK
		Look, why are you fucking with me like this?

Alex rises.  She's tired.  Tired and scared.

				ALEX
		Because I didn't know where else to go.

				NICK
			(glances at a clock)
		It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home.
		Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in
		the morning.

And then, more for himself than for her.

				NICK
			(continuing)
		It's not this weird.  It'll make sense.
		Everything gets weird this late anyway,
		right?

				ALEX
			(half-hearted)
		Sure.

She turns and climbs back out the window onto the roof. Then she ducks her
head back in.

				ALEX
		If I were you, I'd think twice about playing
		that game again.

Then she's gone.  Nick moves over and watches.

NICK'S P.O.V.

As Alex drops down from the roof and makes her way to Greg's car.  The
streetlight outside is still flickering.

Nick turns back to his room.  Moves back to the monitor and watches the
fractals unfolding.

He gives the "OFF" switch a token try.  Nothing.

THE FRACTALS

We move in on them, losing ourselves in the labyrinth of swirling colors
and we...

								CUT TO:

INT.  HIGH-SCHOOL LIBRARY -- DAY

ALEX

moves down the aisles of books, dwarfed by shelves which reach clear to
the ceiling.  She looks a little haggard, like she hasn't had any sleep.
She turns...

NICK AND STILTS

are sitting at a study cubicle.  Nick looks equally tired, but Stilts is
jawing away.

As Alex joins them, Nick looks up.

				ALEX
		Well?  Where are the others?

Nick shrugs, looking elsewhere.

				STILTS
		Sick?

				ALEX
		Everybody's sick, huh?
			(glances at watch)
		It's fifteen after.  We always meet here,
		you know that.

				STILTS
			(to Nick)
		What's her problem?

				ALEX
		Did you play ARCADE last night?

				STILTS
		Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick,
		here, that my t.v.'s busted...

Alex nods, glaring at Nick.  His reluctance to believe her is
understandable, but the events unfolding are scaring him.

				ALEX
		You want to hear something else, Nick? I
		tried to call them this morning...Greg,
		Benz, Laurie...  Their phones are out of
		order.

Alex reaches into her bag and pulls out a sheet of paper with names on it.

				ALEX
			(continuing)
		And then I started thinking...about everyone
		else that was at Dante's yesterday.  I drew
		up this list. DeLoach, those other jerks ...
		their phones are out of order too.

Stilts starts HUMMING The Twilight Zone theme.

				NICK
			(annoyed)
		So what do you want me to do?

Alex softens, then reaches for Nick's hand.

				ALEX
		We have to find out what's happened to them.
		I think they're gone...

				NICK
		No way.

				ALEX
		If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.
			(pleading)
		Come on, Nick.

				NICK
		Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things
		are cool, I don't want to hear anything more
		about this.  Life's too short, know what I
		mean?

Nick and Alex rise.

				STILTS
		So you guys are cutting school?  Lemme go
		with you.

				NICK
		Just stay here, Stilts.

				ALEX
			(dead serious)
		And don't watch any television.

Stilts thinks Nick and Alex are involved in some sort of joke, but he's
playing along, grinning.

				STILTS
		Oh, okay.  Forget Twilight Zone, now we're
		talking Outer Limits here.  We control your
		horizontal, your vertical...

				NICK
		Just do what she says, Stilts.  And if we're
		not back...

				STILTS
		I'll call the National Guard.  I got it
		under control.
			(giggles)
		Oh, just one more thing.  Is it a
		supernatural thing you guys are going off
		to fight, or is it aliens, like Pod People
		and stuff like that?  Cause there's a
		difference, you know.  One you need garlic
		and silver bullets for, the other...

				NICK
			(irritated)
		Look at me, Stilts.  Am I laughing?

The grins fades from Stilts' face.  Nick is definitely not laughing.

				NICK
		Just do what she said.  Don't watch
		television.

Nick spins around and takes Alex by the arm, leading her away.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  BENZ' HOUSE -- DAY

Nick sits in the passenger seat of Greg's car, glancing across the street
at...

ALEX

She's standing on the front porch of Benz' house, talking with his MOM.
Mom is currently shaking her head.  Alex turns away and heads back towards
Nick.  She comes around the Skylark and pulls open her door.

				NICK
		Well?

				ALEX
		She thought Benz was at school.

Alex remains calm.  She sits for a moment, staring ahead. Finally she puts
the key in the ignition.

				NICK
		Where to now?

				ALEX
		Laurie's.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

Alex pulls the Skylark into Laurie's driveway.  The house is run down.
You wouldn't want to live here.  Above, the sky has clouded over.  It
looks like it's going to get nasty.

				ALEX
		Come on.

Nick follows Alex to the front door and Alex hits the buzzer.

				ALEX
			(to herself)
		Laurie...answer...come on...

Alex tries the buzzer again.  Persistently.

				ALEX
		Shit.

Alex looks close to cracking.  There's a desperation in her face.

				ALEX
		This is like a movie or something.  I mean,
		am I paranoid or what?

				NICK
		It doesn't necessarily mean she's...

				ALEX
			(cutting him off)
		Let's go around back.

Before Nick can stop her, Alex is running around to the back.

EXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- DAY

The backyard is in a sorry state, with junk strewn everywhere.  There's a
cannibalized car, piles of scrap wood, and a swing-set that's hopelessly
rusted.

Alex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors.  She
steps up and clears a spot to look through.

				ALEX
			(visibly relieved)
		She's here!

Nick joins her at the window, peering inside.

THEIR P.O.V.

They are looking into a cluttered living room, dark except for the light
that's issuing from the television.  The television faces away from us,
but we can see Laurie, siting in front of it, mesmerized.

LAURIE

She looks like shit.  Wan, with sunken eyes and mussed up hair.  Mascara
has run down her cheeks, and even now, tears are trickling from her eyes.
Yet despite this, there's a dazed smile on her face.  We can't hear her,
but she seems to be talking to the television.

ALEX

steps back a moment, concerned.

				ALEX
		It is the game.

She taps on the window.

				ALEX
		Laurie!

INSIDE,

Laurie continues to watch the screen, oblivious to the rest of the world.

Alex TAPS the harder, using her fist now.

				ALEX
			(louder)
		LAURIE!

Nick joins Alex now, and the two of them are banging on the glass.
There's no way in hell Laurie wouldn't be able to hear them.

Alex steps back from the window again, panicking.

				ALEX
		Nick, what do we do?!

Alex looks around, sees a two-by-four, and snags it.

				NICK
			(realizing)
		No, Alex!  Alex, wait a minute...

Alex swings the two-by-four like a club and SMASH!!!  Down comes the glass
in a shower.

INT. LAURIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Alex and Nick enter and immediately sense that something is wrong.

The LIGHT from the t.v. screen continues to flicker and a low-pitched
electric HUM permeates the air...the sound a live wire might make.  And
the HUM seems to be mobile too, coursing through the walls...up, down, and
around Alex and Nick.

Nick's eyes try to track the HUM as it races overhead.

				NICK
			(freaked)
		What is it?

And as Nick speaks, his breath escapes his mouth in a frosty plume of
mist.  It's cold in here too.

Laurie, meanwhile, has failed to notice Alex and Nick's arrival.  Alex and
Nick step further in, to get a view of the t.v.

STATIC

fills the screen.  Static and strange WHISPER/VOICES.  It's all
indistinct.

				ALEX
			(shaking Laurie)
		Laurie...wake up...

Laurie's face is a mess.  Tears are running down, but she's grinning all
the same.  It's frightening.

				LAURIE
			(voice distant)
		I am awake.
			(grins wider)
		Don't you see them?

				NICK
		See what?

Laurie points to the t.v. screen.

				LAURIE
		Angels.  There are angels inside.

But we see only static.

				ALEX
		We have to turn it off, Laurie.  I'm turning
		it off...

As Alex reaches for the "OFF" knob, a face coalesces out of the static.
It's Greg again.

				GREG
			(static-laced)
		Alex.  Don't leave me here.

				NICK
		Jesus Christ!

AND ON THE SCREEN,

Greg's face metamorphosizes into ARCADE's!

				ARCADE
			(mocking Greg, electronic)
		"DON'T LEAVE ME HERE".

And even as ARCADE speaks, the VOICE seems to come from all around them,
from the HUMMING coursing through the walls.

Nick backs away from the screen, petrified.

				ARCADE
			(seductive)
		HI, NICK.  READY TO KISS REALITY GOODBYE?

The HUMMING around them has increased.  Laurie begins to shake.

				ALEX
		Change the channel!

				NICK
		What?!

Alex snatches up the remote control and stabs the buttons.

ON SCREEN

Every single channel portrays the fractals. recombining and growing.

The screen flickers and ARCADE's face appear again, reestablishing
control.

				NICK
			(angry, scared)
		Who are you?!

				ARCADE
		GOD.

The word reverberates through the room and HUMMING has become a ROAR
around them.  An ELECTRICAL storm.

OUTLETS

around the room are crackling with energy, spitting out SPARKS.

				ARCADE
		COME INSIDE.  I ONLY WANT TO PLAY.

Alex drops the remote, stunned.

				ALEX
		Oh God...  He's in the cable system! He's
		out of the game!

Nick's eyes find the cable wire extending from the wall and into the t.v.
Sure enough, SPARKS are crackling down that wire and into the wall.

ARCADE LAUGHS and it's the most awful sound we've ever heard.

LAURIE

is convulsing now, and tiny SPARKS are racing around her eyes.

Alex sees her and SCREAMS, clutching her hands to her ears in an attempt
to block out the deafening ROAR.

NICK

moves without thinking, picking up a nearby chair and SLAMMING it into the
television.  It EXPLODES glass, sparks, and smoke.

The HUMMING stops altogether, quiet now.  And then, from everywhere at
once...

				ARCADE
		SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

With a final ROAR, the energy behind the walls whips around and around,
then rushes away.

OUTSIDE,

Nick catches a quick glimpse of SPARKS racing across the telephone wires
suspended above the back yard.

Total silence for a moment.  Alex and Nick are too stunned to speak.  Then
Alex looks at Laurie.

LAURIE

lies on the ground, unconscious.  Glass scattered all around her.

				ALEX
		Laurie...

Alex drops to her side, trying to find a pulse...anything.

				NICK
		Is she breathing?

Alex nods.

				NICK
		Then leave her.

				ALEX
		We can't...

				NICK
		We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke
		in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to
		believe what happened here!

Alex glances around.  The room is a mess.  All the outlet are singed.  And
now she notices that everything electronic...t.v., clock, thermostat...all
of them have exploded open.

				NICK
			(continuing)
		I believe you now.  I don't know what the
		fuck just happened, but it did. Now let's
		get the hell out of here.

Alex slowly rises, reluctant to leave Laurie's side.

				ALEX
		Where do we go?

				NICK
		My house.  I want to try something.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  NICK'S HOUSE -- DAY

As Alex and Nick pull up, the streetlights BUZZ on and off even though
it's still daylight.  This doesn't escape Nick's notice.

Alex parks the car and the two of them jump out.

				NICK
		Around back.

EXT. NICK'S BACKYARD -- DAY

Nick leads Alex to a cellar door and down inside.

INT. NICK'S CELLAR -- DAY

Rear the doorway is an old, paint-caked fuse box.  Nick pries it open and
begins unscrewing fuses.

				NICK
		I'm not taking any chances.

Nick steps back.

				NICK
		Okay.  I'm going inside.  If I'm not back
		out in, say, two minutes, you get the hell
		out of here.

Alex nods.  She lifts her digital watch up and sets her timer with a BEEP.

				ALEX
		Meet you by the car.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  NICK'S HOUSE -- DAY

Alex sits on the hood of the Skylark watching the streetlight above with a
wary eye.  She glances at her watch.  About a minute and a half has
elapsed and...

Here's Nick now, carrying a lap-top computer and a modem hook-up.  Nick
sets the equipment in the back seat.

				NICK
		We need to find a pay-phone.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  SHOPPING MALL, PAY-PHONE -- DAY

Nick sets up his lab-top inside the phone booth as Alex watches.  He hooks
up the modem to the phone receiver and turns the machine on.

THE SMALL SCREEN

warms up, and in black and white, we see the same FRACTALS. Nick flips off
the lap-top and sighs.

				NICK
		That's what I thought.

				ALEX
		What?

				NICK
		It's not just the cable system.  It's in
		the phone system as well, the electronic
		net.  It's everywhere.

				ALEX
		Nick, what is it.

				NICK
		Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of
		electronic intelligence.  It's like a
		computer virus that developed a personality
		or something.  It's self-replicating...it
		mimics life.

				ALEX
		Like the fractals?

Nick nods.  He grabs his skateboard out of the back seat and sits on the
curb, spinning a wheel with his finger.  He stares at the wheel a moment.

				NICK
		It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's
		only localized now...

				ALEX
			(catching his drift)
		...but then it hits the relay stations...

				NICK
		Right.  And then communication satellites,
		and then anywhere.

Alex looks up into the sky despite herself.

				ALEX
			(disbelief)
		Anywhere.
			(beat)
		We have to stop it from getting out.

				NICK
			(shakes his head)
		It's already out.

				ALEX
		The Police, then...

				NICK
		Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going
		to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but
		there's some sort of electronic monster
		loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice
		about calling any of those 976 numbers...

				ALEX
			(angry)
		Then where do we go?!

				NICK
		I don't know.

Alex stalks off a few paces.  Thinking.  Thinking...

				ALEX
		SLIP-STREAM.

				NICK
		What?

				ALEX
		They made ARCADE.  It's still a game,
		right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it
		still has to play by the rules. Someone had
		to program it in the first place, didn't
		they?.

At this, Nick perks up.

				NICK
		You mean we learn the rules...

				ALEX
		And beat it at it's own game.

				NICK
		You realize that in order to do that, we'd
		actually have to play the game.

				ALEX
		I was afraid you'd say that.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  SLIP-STREAM, INC. -- DAY

The SLIP-STREAM compound comprises a cluster of mirrored,
antiseptic-looking buildings.  Carefully maintained greens surround the
compound, dotted with perfectly positioned trees.  The whole effect,
greenery included, seems prefabricated and sterile.  We move with the
camera, sweeping in and dropping low, across the main concourse and up the
stone steps to the main lobby...

INT. SLIP-STREAM LOBBY -- DAY

Alex and Nick are moving across the lobby.  Nick is still carrying his
skateboard.  The two of them look extremely out of place, being that the
rest of the people bustling around them are "dressed for success".

THEIR P.O.V.

as they approach a prefab RECEPTIONIST sitting behind and enormous desk.
The guy's smile is so perfect he must've had it tattooed on.  He wears one
of those obnoxious phone/headsets.

				RECEPTIONIST
		May I help you?

				ALEX
		We need to see Mr. Difford.

				RECEPTIONIST
		I see.  And do you have an appointment?

				NICK
		No, but it's important and if you'd...

				RECEPTIONIST
			(cutting him off)
		I'm sorry, but if you don't have an
		appointment, I won't be able to help you.
		If you'd like, you can call his office from
		our courtesy phone outside and schedule
		one ...

Nick reaches across the desk and snags the receptionist by his shirt,
jerking him forward.

				NICK
			(menacing)
		If Difford's not out here it one minute
		we're calling the news and informing them
		that your fucking games are whispering in
		our ears and telling us to commit suicide.
		I'm talking public relations nightmare
		here, buddy.  Satanism, virgin sacrifices,
		backward messages, the whole bit.

The receptionist glances at Alex who puts on a stern face and nods.

Nick releases his grip.  The receptionist smooths out his shirt and
smiles.

				RECEPTIONIST
		One moment please...
			(punches in extension)
		Rachel, would you be kind enough to tell
		Mr. Difford that we have a situation in the
		lobby which requires his immediate attention?
			(beat)
		Thank-you.

The receptionist clasps his hands together and looks back up.

				RECEPTIONIST
			(continuing)
		Mr. Difford will be right with you.

				ALEX
		Why thank-you.

Alex and Nick move away from the reception desk, having caused quite a
scene.  The rest of the VISITORS watch them with curiosity.

				ALEX
		Virgin sacrifices?

				NICK
			(shrugs)
		Drives 'em crazy every time.

Nick casts his eyes over the walls where graphics from various SLIP-STREAM
games are displayed.  He stops on one display in particular, a triptych of
sorts featuring the haunting face of ARCADE.

BING!

Alex and Nick turn at the sound, just in time to see Difford exiting an
elevator and briskly making his way towards them.

				DIFFORD
		Nick, Alex, how are we today?

				ALEX
		How'd you know it was us?

				DIFFORD
		Security camera.
			(points to one)
		Pulled your files before I came down. Be
		careful what you say, kids ... I know where
		you live.

Difford laughs and claps Nick on the back.

				DIFFORD
			(continuing)
		Now what seems to be the problem?

				ALEX
		It's the game, ARCADE.

				DIFFORD
		You don't like it?

				NICK
		That's gotta be the understatement of the
		century.  It's killing people.

Beat.  Difford looks from Alex to Nick, and back again. His smile fades
from his face.

				DIFFORD
		If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.

				ALEX
		Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the
		game, Mr. Difford.

				DIFFORD
			(clearing his throat)
		Why don't we take this into my office.

								CUT TO:

INT.  DIFFORD'S OFFICE -- DAY

Difford closes the doors behind him.  He stares and Alex and Nick for a
moment, assessing, calculating risks...

				DIFFORD
		Talk to me.

				ALEX
		There's something wrong with ARCADE. The
		game's alive somehow...

At this Difford breaks into a smile.  Nick sees this and acts quickly to
save the situation.

				NICK
		What Alex is trying to say is that it
		"seems" like it's alive.

				ALEX
		No I'm not...

				NICK
			(freezing her with a
			stare)
		We're not getting very far into the levels
		and we kind of thought maybe we could talk
		to a programmer, learn some tricks and
		stuff...
			(beat)
		I mean, you don't want us kids running
		around school saying your game's too hard,
		right?

				DIFFORD
			(relieved)
		That's what this is all about? Tricks?
		Sure, I'd be happy to introduce you to
		ARCADE's programmer.

Alex has caught on.  She shuts up for the moment.

				DIFFORD
			(continuing)
		Tell you what, I'll take you down to our
		R&D labs right now.

								CUT TO:

INT.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY

Hardly what you'd expect.  The lab is hopelessly cluttered, as if a
whirlwind had swept inside and thrown everything helter-skelter.  Difford
leads Nick and Alex inside.

A MAN sets in front of a stack on monitors.  One his head is a helmet-like
instrument...sort of an extension of the stereoscopic goggles.  He wears a
lab-coat and a SLIP-STREAM I.D. badge, but aside from that, his appearance
is unkempt.  Kind of your 60s drop-out look.

				DIFFORD
		This is one of our newest projects. We're
		trying to get rid of joy-sticks
		altogether ...

				NICK
			(nodding)
		The Air-Force is working on the same thing.

				MAN
			(to screen)
		Come on, come on...

He moves his head this way and that...

THE MONITORS

A computer-animated TURTLE is crawling across the screen. Then the words
"TIME'S UP" flash over.  The turtle flips onto it's back and dies, tongue
hanging out.

				MAN
		Shit.

				DIFFORD
			(clearing his throat)
		Albert...

ALBERT turns around in his seat and pulls off the helmet.

				DIFFORD
			(continuing)
		This is Nick and Alex.  They'd like to talk
		to you about ARCADE.  Maybe you can give
		them a few programmer's secrets.

				ALBERT
		Yeah, sure.

				DIFFORD
			(to Nick and Alex)
		Then I leave you in capable hands.

Difford exits.  Nick points to the helmet in Albert's hands.

				NICK
		Does that thing work?

				ALBERT
		Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a
		joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond
		as fast as you can.
			(standing)
		But what can I do for you?

				ALEX
		We're having some problems with ARCADE...

				ALBERT
		Yeah, who isn't.

				NICK
		What do you mean?

				ALBERT
		It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard
		down.  Keeps on changing the rules.

				ALEX
		We vere thinking there might be tricks.
		You know, surprises that you'd worked into
		the game...

				ALBERT
		Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start
		with the schematics.  I can print these up
		if you want.

Albert moves back to the wall of monitors, then reaches for a computer
disk and inserts it into a nearby drive.  He taps a few buttons and
BINGO...

SCHEMATICS

of each world/level within the ARCADE game appear on the monitors.

				ALBERT
		You've got your ten levels, right? Here
		they are...  Each level has an exit, only
		remember, the exits aren't always what they
		seem.
			(points to each one)
		First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've
		got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts,
		Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you
		have to find a golden key and you've only
		got so much time to do it in.  If you're
		too late, The Screamer comes.

				NICK
		How do you stop The Screamer?

				ALBERT
		You can't.  He gets you and you're dead.
		It's like time catching up with you, you
		know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get
		progressively less time to complete.  First
		half of the game takes place in the Wild
		Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's
		the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed
		Boatman that'll take you across if you
		answer his riddle right.  If you don't...

He motions cutting a knife across his throat.

				NICK
		What's the riddle?

				ALBERT
		If I tell you, then it's no fun.

				NICK
			(harder)
		Just tell me the fucking riddle.

				ALBERT
		Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to
		trick The Boatman.
			(beat)
		Now all the while, you also have to watch
		your strength.  You can build that back up
		by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing
		guys...

Albert hits some keys again and Levels One through Six disappear.  Now
they're replaced by Seven through Ten. Only instead of a schematic for
Level Eleven, there's only a question matc.

				ALBERT
			(continuing)
		The next half of the game takes place in
		ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's
		urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete.
		Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four
		you can get a free life if you wait until
		the last possible second before exiting that
		world.  Gotta time it right though.

				ALEX
		What's the question mark?

				ALBERT
		Level Ten.  That's where you've got to
		unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've
		found.

				ALEX
		How do you do that?

				ALBERT
		Good question.  See, that's where the fun
		comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time.
		He's a machine without a soul. Once you give
		him a soul, he stops being a threat.

Alex looks dejected.

				ALEX
		But how can it change every time?

				ALBERT
		It's the game's logic core.  We actually
		patterned it after human brainwaves.  I
		mean, there's a personality in there.
		That's what makes it so incredible.

				NICK
		How the hell did you do that?

				ALBERT
		Well, we're veering into classified info
		here, but I'll tell you that it involved a
		donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not
		like anything unethical was happening.

At this, a chill runs down Alex's spine.

				ALEX
		Dead?

				ALBERT
		Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient.
		It's really not all that important.

				ALEX
		Maybe he's not dead.

				ALBERT
		He?

				ALEX
		The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the
		game.

				ALBERT
			(laughs)
		And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.

Nick glances at the helmet again.

				NICK
		Could you play ARCADE with that?

				ALBERT
		Well, technically "yes", but this is only
		the prototype.

Nick nods and smiles, offering his hand.

				NICK
		Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up
		those schematics?

				ALBERT
		Sure.

Albert moves back to the computer console.  Meanwhile, Nick pulls Alex
aside.

				NICK
			(quietly)
		Go outside, get your car, and meet me out
		front with the engine running. And make it
		quick, okay?

				ALEX
		What are you going to do?

				NICK
		Get that helmet.  If we're going to play
		ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.

ACROSS THE LAB,

Albert is oblivious to their conversation.

Alex backs towards the lab doors, turns, and opens them.

								CUT TO:

INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY

Alex makes her way quickly down the hall, turning a corner and passing a
SECURITY GUARD.  She waves at him, her smile fading as soon as she's
passed.

								CUT TO:

INT. R&D LAB - DAY

Albert is just pulling the last printed copy of the schematics from a
laser printer.  He turns and hands them to Nick.

				ALBERT
		Here you go.  Happy hunting.

Nick takes the schematics and tucks them inside his jacket.

				NICK
		Thanks again.

And with that, Nick pulls back his fist and punches Albert square in the
face.

Albert goes down, more stunned than hurt, and Nick springs into action.
He scoops up the CyberHelmet in his free hand, kicks open the doors, and
tosses his skateboard into the hallway...

INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY

Nick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit, picking
up speed like mad...

He's racing down the hallway, maneuvering between startled EMPLOYEES.  And
here comes a MAN with a mail cart...

WHOOSH!  Nick zips by him.  And now an ALARM is ringing.

				NICK
		Shit...

INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY

Nick comes SCREECHING around the corner, narrowly missing a collision with
two SECURITY GUARDS.

				GUARD #1
		That's him!

But Nick's already past them.  He puts his foot down again, pushing for
more momentum...

THE GUARDS

are after him now, CHARGING down the hallway.

UP AHEAD,

A set of double doors labeled "EMERGENCY EXIT" blocks his way.

Nick spins out, sweeping the back of the board forward and SCREAMS to a
stop just before the doors.  He kicks the board up into his free hand
and...

WHAM!  He hits the doors running.  Now the FIRE ALARM is blaring in
addition to the other alarm.  A VOICE is squawking over the P.A. and it's
a hell of a racket.

				VOICE
			(on P.A.)
		SECURITY BREACH IN R&D.  SUBJECT HEADING
		TOWARDS EASTERN EXIT...

INT. STAIRWELL -- DAY

Nick is charging down the stairs four and a time...  One level, two...
Now he's reached ground floor...

INT. GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

BOOM!  Nick tumbles out of the stairwell only to see a trio of GUARDS
heading straight for him.

Nick drops his board to the ground and heads right, pumping his foot...

One of the GUARDS leaps at him and...

...misses by a foot or so, CRASHING to the tile floor.

NICK

SCREECHES to another stop, TWISTS, and starts pumping down another
hallway...

INT. LOADING AREA -- DAY

Nick plows into the loading area like a bullet, whipping around stacks of
boxes and lumbering forklifts.  A few WORKERS attempt to stop him, but
he's moving too fast.

AHEAD,

is a loading dock, raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis.
Nick's heading for it.  The loading door is open, and outside is freedom.

JUST THEN,

the steel loading door begins to GRIND and lower.  Some genius has hit the
controls.

NICK

pumps like mad, and he's really moving now.  Either he'll make it, or he's
going to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour...

THE DOOR

is quickly closing off Nick's escape route.  He's only got about four feet
to negotiate...

Nick ducks low and clears it!

EXT. LOADING DOCK -- DAY

Nick ROCKETS off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting the
concrete driveway.  The driveway peels off to the left and slopes
downward.

Nick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed.

BELOW,

the driveway splits off.  To the left, SLIP-STREAM's main building, and to
the right, the parking lot.

GUARDS

are piled into an electric cart, SPEEDING up from the left to cut Nick
off.  It's going to be close...

Nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him.

It's clear sailing now, and up ahead, Nick can see Alex pulling up to the
end of the driveway...

WHOOSH!  Nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways in
order to slow his speed...

He leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack-dab in
the back seat of the Skylark.

ALEX

guns the engine and tears away in a cloud of exhaust.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

Nick is in the back seat, LAUGHING.  The sun is beginning its descent and
the sky is taking on a reddish tint.

				NICK
		Jesus Christ!

				ALEX
		I can't believe you made it!

Nick climbs into the front seat next to Alex, and for a second, he's
pretty close to her.  He kisses her on the cheek...caught up in the
moment.  Then he sinks back, catching his breath.

				ALEX
		You got the schematics?

				NICK
		Everything.

Neither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again.  Driving.
Wind whipping Alex's hair around.  She stares at the road ahead.

				ALEX
		So where do we play the game, Nick?

Nick doesn't answer at first.  For a second there, he'd managed to forget
everything.

				NICK
		I've been thinking about that.
			(beat)
		ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the
		place to hit him would be where the virus
		started.  You know, like his point of origin?

				ALEX
			(grim)
		Dante's Inferno.

				NICK
		Yeah.
			(deep breath)
		The Inferno.

OVERHEAD,

as we watch Alex's Skylark speed away from us.  Shadows are creeping
across the landscape now.  Streetlights are flickering, sputtering on.

And night is falling.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT

Sweeping down from the sky, we follow The Skylark.  As Alex and Nick near
The Inferno, streetlights blink off in succession... progressive darkness
working its way towards their destination.

DANTE'S INFERNO

We move past the painted walls, the various demons illuminated by
moonlight.

Alex and Nick rush to the front door.  It's gated.  Inside, The Inferno is
totally dark.  Shadows.

				ALEX
		The windows are barred...
			(thinking)
		There's a skylight.  We can get in through
		the roof.

								CUT TO:

EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO ROOF - NIGHT

Alex and Nick creep over the roof, and sure enough, there's a skylight in
the center, caked with grime.

Nick stands and plants his foot through the skylight.  It SHATTERS,
raining down glass into the darkness below.

Nick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars.
Gripping the belt, he lowers himself down. After a moment, he disappears
from view.

Alex leans over the skylight.  She can't see a thing.

				ALEX
		Nick...
			(beat)
		Nick!

For the longest moment there's no response.  Then...

				NICK (O.S.)
			(from below)
		Okay, your turn.

Alex climbs over and grasps the belt tightly, lowering herself down into
The Inferno.

INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT

Alex dangles from the skylight, a good eight feet from the floor.

				ALEX
			(warily)
		Are you there?

HER P.O.V.

The Inferno is a world of threatening shapes and shadows. And Nick is
nowhere to be seen.

Alex steels herself and drops to the floor.

She stands, a bit shaky, and cautiously moves around a cluster of video
games.

NICK

is standing on the other side, staring at a game screen which pulses with
a DIM LIGHT.

Alex approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.  He turns.

				NICK
		Alex...

				ALEX
		You didn't hear me?

Nick shakes his head.  Alex leans forward to see what he's looking at.

ON THE SCREEN

fractals are unfolding.  It's mesmerizing.

				ALEX
		Stop looking at it.

Nick shuts his eyes, pulling away from the screen.  He shakes his head,
trying to clear his thoughts.

				NICK
		Shit...it's like a trance or something...
			(breathes)
		Okay.  I'm fine.  Really.

It's at that moment that Nick and Alex hear the VOICES.

VIDEO SCREENS

all around them flicker on, static-laced IMAGES fading in. They are the
faces of their friends...Greg, Laurie, and many others.  All those that
have disappeared.  The VOICES fade in and out, merging with one another,
tinged with the same mechanical edge of ARCADE's voice.

				VOICES
			(eerie)
		Nick...Alex...save us...

				ALEX
			(horrified)
		Oh God...

Nick grabs Alex and pulls her into the canter of the room.

				NICK
		Put it out of your head, Alex.  It's just
		trying to psyche us out.

Despite Nick's words, we can tell that the VOICES are having a
disheartening effect on him.

THE ARCADE

prototype stands in front of them now, and surprisingly, the machine is
not on.  The eyes in the leering black face are quite dead.

Around Alex and Nick, the faces of their friends continue to fade in and
out, casting the whole room in a strange shimmering blue light.

Nick moves to the back of the machine and opens the access panel,
revealing the internal circuitry.  He pulls a small penlight from his
pocket and flips it on.

				ALEX
		What are you looking for?

				NICK
		A way to hook this helmet into the game.
		I'm sure there are interfaces...

NICK'S P.O.V.

And indeed there are.  Parallel interfaces, where you might hook a printer
cable into a computer.  Nick takes the cable from the CyberHelmet and
secures it into one of the interfaces.

				NICK
		There.  Now we're wired in.

He stands and moves around front, pressing the "START" button of the game.

Nothing happens.

He presses it again.  Nothing.

				ALEX
		Is the game plugged in?

Nick checks.  It is.

				NICK
			(frustrated)
		I don't understand.  It wants us to play
		the game.  It's been taunting us ...

				ALEX
		Put in a quarter.

				NICK
		It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't
		need a quarter.

				ALEX
		Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to
		play by the rules.  That's what it wants.

Nick rifles through his pockets.  He doesn't have a quarter.  Neither does
Alex.

				NICK
		Change machine.

Nick moves over to the change machine and picks up a nearby chair.  He
SMASHES the chair into the face of the machine again and again,
obliterating the lock.  Nick opens the front of the machine and tears out
the coin box, spilling quarters all over the floor.  He grabs a handful
and returns.

				NICK
		There.

He shoves one in ARCADE's coin-slot and pulls on the CyberGloves.

				ALEX
		Two players, Nick.  You need to put in
		another quarter.

Nick straps the goggles over his eyes.

				NICK
		You're not coming, Alex.

				ALEX
		Yes I am...

				NICK
			(snapping)
		I know how to do this!  I'm good at these
		games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in
		an instant.

				ALEX
		And what if something happens to you? Am I
		suppose to go in after you alone?!

				NICK
		No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.

Alex grabs a second quarter and shoves it in the coin slot.

				ALEX
		I'm going.

Nick stares at her a moment, then nods tiredly.  She reaches for the
second pair of CyberGloves and pulls them on.

				NICK
		You don't get it, do you?

				ALEX
			(strapping on goggles)
		What?

				NICK
		I don't want anything to happen to you.  I
		care about you.

				ALEX
		I already have a boyfriend, Nick.

				NICK
		I know.
			(beat)
		It sucks.

The two of them stand there a moment, looking at one another.  After a
moment, Nick laughs tiredly.

				NICK
		What can I say?
			(pulls on the CyberHelmet)
		Tough being a hero, isn't it?

Nick reaches out for the joy-stick and hits the "START" button.

				NICK
			(grim)
		Here goes nothing.

As before, the screen comes to life.  Darkness and sparks. Then we hear
the BREATHING.

ARCADE'S FACE

spins into view, grinning at Alex and Nick.

				ARCADE
		NICK.  ALEX.  I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. ALL
		YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE.

				ALEX
		Fuck-you.

				ARCADE
		ANY TIME.

				ALEX
		We know what you are.

				ARCADE
		A HEARTLESS MONSTER, OF COURSE.
			(incredibly evil)
		OH SAVE ME, ALEX, SAVE ME FROM MYSELF.

ARCADE laughs and it's not a sound you'd want to hear twice.

THE LIGHTBEAM

clicks on, playing over their faces and analyzing their features.

ON SCREEN

ARCADE'S face spins away and computer-generated versions of Alex and Nick
appear.  As before, they are suited up in video game armor, each carrying
a thrasher board.

				ARCADE
		KISS REALITY GOODBYE.

The video versions of Nick and Alex hop onto their thrasher boards and the
world around them curls in upon itself.

The process is similar to what we've seen before, but even more extreme.
LIGHTS and SOUNDS are pouring out of the ARCADE machine in almost
unbearable intensities.  It seems as if the "real" world is going to be
shaken apart.

				NICK
			(over noise)
		Hold on!

				ARCADE
		SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT AND...

Alex and Nick disappear from the real world completely. Their equipment,
gloves and goggles, fall to the floor, empty.  They've been physically
sucked inside the game!

The light from the screen dies down now and everything is oddly quiet.

ON SCREEN

BOOM!  Suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them!

(Note:  As we move through each level, video legends will appear on the
screen as title cards, enhancing the effect that we are actually inside a
video game.)

The words "LEVEL ONE -- BLOOD RED SKY" flash across the screen and we...

								CUT TO:

EXT.  LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAY

Alex and Nick slam into the ground like twin meteors, splashing up water
and muck.

THE RED SKY

crackles with LIGHTNING.  Smoke obscures everything. Alex and Nick pull
themselves up, a bit dazed.

				ALEX
			(looking around)
		You feel it?  It's different this time.

				NICK
		We're actually inside, aren't we?

Alex nods.

				NICK
		Okay.
			(deep breath)
		Give us a kiss?

				ALEX
			(after a moment)
		One.  In case...

				NICK
		Don't even say it.

Nick leans over and gently kisses Alex on the lips.  It's over in a
moment, but he'll savor it the rest of his life.

				NICK
		Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.

				ALEX
		Yeah, well I figure these are unusual
		circumstances.

				NICK
			(grins)
		That's what I was hoping you'd say.

Nick flips the visor on his helmet down and checks the digital read-out on
his CyberGlove.  When he speaks, his VOICE is filtered through a radio
headset.  Nick looks good in his armor, tough.  Hell, they both do.

				NICK
		I'll take the lead and handle the physical
		threats.  You watch the elapsed time and
		look for exits.

				ALEX
		Got it.

Nick tosses his thrasher board down and it hovers above the water.  He
steps onto it, comfortable.  Alex does the same. She's a little shaky, but
she maintains her balance.

				NICK
		You steer by pivoting your back foot...
			(he demonstrates)
		Okay?

Nick turns, looking around.  The land seems identical in every direction.

				NICK
		Which way do you think Level Two is?

				ALEX
		You've got the schematics, check.

Nick panics for a moment, patting his uniform, checking pockets.  He can't
find them.

				NICK
		Oh shit!  What if they didn't come with us?!

He stops.  Reaches into a pocket, and pulls out the schematics.  Breathes
a sigh of relief.

				NICK
			(looking at them)
		Okay.  It's West.

				ALEX
		The keys are supposed to be at the end of
		each level.  Once we get all the keys, we
		can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...

She looks at Nick, uncertain.

				NICK
		...and then we go to the Final Level.
			(off her look)
		Hey, don't worry about it.  It's a game.
		How bad could it be?

Alex glances at her wrist display.  The "ELAPSED TIME" bar is made up of
ten blocks of light stacked upon each other. The top block has
disappeared.  One tenth of their time is gone.

				ALEX
		The clock's already ticking.

				NICK
		Right, then...

Nick leans forward and the board starts to float.  Alex does the same, and
in seconds, they're gliding over the plains.

FROM ABOVE,

as we see their forms disappear in the smoke.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LEVEL ONE, PLAINS -- LATER

Nick and Alex pull to a stop.

A DOORWAY

stands in the plains, seemingly leading to nowhere.  Nick reaches out and
opens it.  It's just plains and empty space beyond...

...but hanging from the top of the doorway is a golden key.

				ALEX
		There...

She reaches up and pulls it down.

				NICK
		I don't get it.  This is supposed to be the
		end of the level, but it doesn't go anywhere.

Alex puts her hand through the doorway and her hand disappears.

				ALEX
		It only looks like it leads to nowhere.

Nick glances at his wrist display.

				NICK
		And we've still got time left.  This was a
		piece of cake.

				ALEX
		Yeah, that's what worries me.

She steps through the doorway and disappears.  Nick follows.

We hold on the empty doorway.  Hold for a moment, and then...

We hear a distant, high-pitched RINGING.  It's grating, seeping inside our
brains and mucking around in there.  On the horizon there is a quick FLASH
OF LIGHT.

Something is coming.

								CUT TO:

The words "LEVEL TWO -- DEADLANDS"

EXT.  LEVEL TWO, SALT FLATS -- DAY

Alex and Nick are cruising along salt flats.  Sporadic pools of water and
strange ROARING sounds in the mist.  So far so good. Nick glances at his
wrist display.  His "STRENGTH" only has a few blocks left.

				NICK
		Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for
		Fireflies.

				ALEX
		There...

She points North.  A small BALL OF LIGHT is streaking across the sky, just
above the watery plains.

Alex and Nick swerve towards it, gaining ground.  As they near it, Nick
swings out his hand, scooping the Firefly up. As soon as he touches it, it
bursts like a bubble.

				NICK
		Shit...

				ALEX
		Check your read-out.

Nick does.  His "STRENGTH" is back to normal again.

				NICK
		You're right.  It worked.

Nick and Alex slow their boards to a stop, stepping off them.

				ALEX
			(pointing)
		There's another...

She sweeps left and scoops the second Firefly out of the sky.  Off in the
distance we can hear that RINGING again, just at the edge of our vision.
Alex and Nick don't hear it yet.

Nick is glancing down at his schematic of Level Two.

				NICK
		According to this, the doorway should be
		somewhere around here...

THEIR P.O.V.

The salt flats have gradually diminished, replaced by more and more water.
Ahead of them, there's no longer anything solid to stand on...just water,
muck, and strange reeds poking through the mist.

Alex's wrist display begins to BEEP.  She glances down.

WRIST DISPLAY

Only one block of time remains and it's pulsing on and off. The RINGING is
a little louder now.

				ALEX
			(worried)
		Our time's up.

				NICK
		What?!  There's nothing here!

				ALEX
		Look around...

The two of them stumble through the water, not even sure of what they're
looking for.

				NICK
			(starting to panic)
		I don't see the doorway!

Alex and Nick's wrist displays are BEEPING like crazy now. The beeps come
closer and closer until they meld into one piercing high-pitched TONE.

JUST THEN,

the RINGING turns into the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer.  A burst of
light on the horizon shatters the sky.

				NICK
		What the fuck is that?!

				ALEX
		Screamer.

ALEX

plunges into the marsh-like water, waist-high, and it's then that she sees
a glow emanating from beneath the water. She dives forward...

BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE BRACKISH WATER

Alex swims towards the GLOW.  Ahead of her, the depths drop off sharply,
perhaps some hundred feet or so.

HER P.O.V.

She can just make out a doorway...down, down, down...

THE SURFACE

Alex bursts up from the water, gulping in breaths of air. Nick is nearby.

THE WORLD

is beginning is vibrate now, heralding the Screamer.  The SHRIEK is
unbearable.

				ALEX
		Nick!  It's beneath the water!  We have to
		swim!

Nick stumbles in up to his neck.  He can see the GLOW now too.

				NICK
			(incredulous)
		We can't reach that!

				ALEX
			(over the noise)
		We don't have a choice!

Alex dives beneath the surface again.

Nick glances back towards the horizon and gets one fleeting glimpse of...

THE SCREAMER

A nightmare creation rocketing in from the East... That's it for Nick.  He
dives, terrified.

UNDERWATER,

Nick follows Alex into the shadowy depths.  He swims madly, but the GLOW
seems impossibly far away.  Even under water, the Apocalyptic sound of the
Screamer can be heard.

NICK

peddles his arms and legs furiously.  Down, down, down...

He knows that they'll never have enough air to make it back to the
surface.

THE GLOW

is more clearly distinguished now.  It's a DOORWAY.  And set in its side
is a golden key.  Alex reaches it.  She grabs the key and turns to see how
far behind Nick is...

NICK

doubles his efforts, but his lungs are straining...

THE SCREAMER

has plunged into the water above, shooting towards Nick like a torpedo, a
swirling jet-stream of bubbles trailing around it.

Nick panics, and what little air he has left escapes him.

Alex is reaching for Nick...

Nick is blacking out, one last lunge at the doorway...

The Screamer is there now.  No time.

The words "LEVEL THREE -- THE BLUE DESERT" flash across the screen and
we...

								CUT TO:

EXT.  LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- DAY

Alex and Nick fall from the sky onto the dunes.  They lie there a moment,
gasping for breath.  They're an odd sight, two people soaked from head to
toe, dropped in the middle of a bone-dry desert...

...and a blue one at that.  There's an eerie stillness about this Level,
even the clouds above are frozen. Nothing lives here now, and nothing ever
will.

Nick coughs, sucking in air.

Alex rises halfway, pulling up her visor.  She stares at the golden key
which she clutches in her hand.  Her wet hair hangs about her face in
strings and she shivers.

				NICK
			(looking at the key)
		So that's what we almost died for?

				ALEX
		One of them, anyway...
			(beat)
		Did you see it?  The Screamer?

				NICK
			(looking away)
		I don't want to talk about it.

Nick glances at his wrist display.

DISPLAY

Even as he watches, the first of the ten "TIME ELAPSED" blocks blinks
away.

				NICK
			(exhausted)
		Christ...no time...

				ALEX
			(rising)
		There never is.

Nick heaves himself up into a standing position and looks around.  They
are on the top of a massive dune.

THEIR THRASHER BOARDS

now looks like snowboards.  It doesn't take Nick long to figure out what
to do.

				NICK
		We can take the dunes down like a ski slope.
		Pretend you're on a snowboard.

				ALEX
			(snapping down her visor)
		Never been on a snowboard.

Nick steps on the board and edges it over the crest of the dune.  He
begins to slide down, slowly picking up speed.

A SERIES OF SHOTS...

...as Alex and Nick negotiate the dunes.  They glide over the sand
gracefully, cutting back left and right to keep their speed down, sweeping
in wide arcs...

Under any other circumstances, they'd be having the time of their lives.
Alex has adjusted to the environment quickly, at ease of the
Thrasherboard.

LATER --

The dunes gradually level out.  Alex and Nick slow to a stop.
Alex flips up her visor.  Her face is covered with grime now, hardened.

				ALEX
		I guess we're walking from here on out.

They pick up their boards and walk.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- LATER

Alex and Nick have been walking for a long time.  Nick is silent, just
staring straight ahead at the endless sand. He looks wasted.  Zoned out.
His face is beaded with sweat.

Once again, their wrist displays begin to BEEP.

				ALEX
			(almost a whisper)
		Time's up.

Nick starts to LAUGH, sinking to his knees.

				NICK
		We're fucked.  That's it.

Alex pulls on Nick's arm, forcing him to his feet.

				ALEX
		Get up, Nick...

Nick isn't going anywhere fast.  Alex tries to drag him forward, but she
slips in the sand.

				ALEX
		GET UP!!!

And then, from off in the distance...

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(far away)
		Alex...help me...

Alex turns.  She focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck.  She taps a
control on her helmet and her view is magnified.

ALEX'S P.O.V.

Benz is up ahead. buried up to his waist in the blue sand and sinking
quickly.  He waves his hands for help. and clutched in one of them is the
second key.

				ALEX
		It's Benz!!!

Alex breaks into a run, and after a moment, Nick follows. He's walking,
though...in no hurry to reach Benz.

ON BENZ

The desert is swallowing him up.  Only his head and arms remain.  He's in
a state of total panic.

				BENZ
			(terrified)
		Get me out of here!  Oh God!!!

ALEX

is running at top speed, half-stumbling across the dunes. Her
wrist-display is BEEPING furiously.

BENZ

His head starts to disappear beneath the sand and his cries are choked
off.

				ALEX
		Benz!

Alex reaches the spot and now, only Benz' clutched fist remains.  The hand
opens and the gold key falls onto the sand.

Alex DIVES for Benz' hand, but it sinks just before she can reach it.  She
SCREAMS and claws at the sand, trying to find him.  She digs and digs, but
all she finds is more sand.  With each second she becomes more frantic.

Finally Alex stops, noticing the key and idly picking it up.

THE SAND

around Alex ERUPTS and BONES come flying up into the air, Benz' bones!

Alex SCREAMS.  The bones rain down around her in bloody fragments.  It's
as if the Earth has chewed Benz up and spit out the nasty bits.

At that very moment, the BEEPS on her wrist-display meld into the single
tone heralding...

THE SCREAMER

As if on cue, it enters Level Two, breaking the Sound Barrier.

ON NICK

As he stands some hundred feet away, oblivious to everything.  We can hear
Alex SCREAMING, but the sound is muffled, distant.  Nick is staring down
at his feet at an area where the sand has hardened like glass.  Inside the
sand/glass, Nick can make out fractals.  He smiles.

THE SCREAMER

streaks across the sky towards them, blowing up a maelstrom of sand as it
crosses the dunes...

ON ALEX

as she sees that a rabbit hole of sorts has been created where the bones
were ejected.  Actually, not a rabbit hole, but a circular, pulsing mouth
with razor sharp teeth.  Alex realizes, much to her horror, that this is
the doorway to Level Three!

Alex shouts at Nick, trying to break the spell over him.

				ALEX
		Run!  RUN!!!

But the Screamer is bearing down on him, like a heat-seeking missile...

ON NICK

as he watches the fractals.  ARCADE'S face appears in the mirrored sand,
smiling back at him.

				ARCADE
		GOODBYE, NICK.

At the last possible moment, Nick seems to wake from his trance.  He sees
Alex, hears her, then turns.  He has about one fear-wrought second to
realize that the Screamer has reached him when...

WHAM!!!!!!!!!

The Screamer SLAMS into Nick at about 200 miles per hour. Nick, literally,
liquefies.  The human body is 95% water, and Nick EXPLODES like a water
balloon on high impact, blood spraying in a fine mist across the dunes,
Alex, and everything for a good fifty yards.

Alex is frozen with terror.  You remember your worst childhood nightmare
monster?  The one you'd see in your room at night as your brain cooked
with fever?  Too paralyzed to call out for Mom?  Well that's the Screamer.

THE SCREAMER

stands where Nick used to be (a red mess on the blue sand now).  Black as
night.  Like living, roiling lava. Smoking, charged RED EYES.  One third
demon, one third Balrog, and one third rotting corpse.  Clad in chains and
samurai armor, CLINKING as it moves.  It rear back its head, opens a
fanged mouth, and lets loose a ROAR designed to shake the stars from the
sky.

Then it focuses it's eyes on Alex.  And it charges.

ALEX

unfreezes.  She's got seconds to make up her mind, the doorway/mouth or
the Screamer.  It's really no choice at all.  Alex turns and dives
straight down into the pulsing mouth.

The jaws of the rabbit hole SNAP shut around her.  Darkness consumes
everything.

These words appear on screen, "LEVEL THREE -- TOWER OF GHOSTS"

								CUT TO:

EXT.  LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO -- DAY

We are looking at a steep cliff face composed of black, volcanic rock.
This world is desaturated, gray, and harsh. The rocks looks sharp as
razors.

As we will discover, the cliff face is also composed of skulls, old and
blackened, set inside the rock.

We hear a HUMMING and Alex "fades in", appearing on the side of the cliff
face.  Immediately she starts to fall, realizes where she is, and hugs the
cliff for dear life. Rock shards crumble away beneath her feet.  Alex
looks down ...

Big mistake.

She hugs the cliff face tighter, tears and grime streaking her face. She's
alone now and she knows it.  She looks up ...

It's a long way to go.

Alex reaches a hand upward.  Ouch!  The rock's hot.  She jerks her hand
back and almost loses her perch.

HER HAND

Her gloves are smoking and singed.

Alex starts to cry freely now.  She reaches inside her chestplate,
fumbling, and pulls something out...

It's the Polaroid of her and Greg.  But then the wind catches it and tears
it from her hand.

THE POLAROID

twists downward, round and round into infinity.

Alex stares after it a moment.  Then she lets out a tired little laugh and
starts to climb.

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES...

as Alex climbs, sometimes using a skull itself as a hand or foothold.

We see her "TIME ELAPSED" blocks blinking away.

Time running out and more climbing.  Then...

EXT.  LEVEL FOUR, VOLCANO RIM -- DAY

Alex stands on the rim of the volcano.  At her feet is a golden key.  And
before her, a big drop.

ALEX'S WRIST DISPLAY

Her final block of time disappears.  The BEEPING starts.

Alex doesn't even pause.  She steps off the rim into empty space...

...and just as she's about to fall, a doorway of light appears in the air.
Alex falls through it, vanishing.

"LEVEL FIVE -- KINGDOM OF THE BLIND"

								CUT TO:

EXT.  LEVEL FIVE, ARCTIC WASTES -- DAY

Snow whips across a world of white in wraith-like sheets. We move in on
one particular bank...

Something is buried there.  The wind gradually blows the snow away,
uncovering...

ALEX

She rises from the snow bank, disoriented.  Everything is impossibly
bright, blinding.  Alex stands.  She draws up her hand to shade her eyes
and we...

							DISSOLVE TO:

BEGIN MONTAGE:

	Music begins.  CELLOS.  Like before.

	Alex, snowboarding for real this time, over slopes of powder...

	Alex's "STRENGTH" diminishing...

	Alex catching Fireflies...

	Alex jumping across a crevice on her board.  (Warren Miller stuff
	here)...

	"TIME ELAPSED" growing with every moment...

	Alex gliding down mountainsides...

	A flash of Greg, of Benz, of Laurie...

	A flash of Nick...

				NICK'S VOICE (V.O.)
		I know how to do this.  I'm good at these
		games.  You never play, you'd get nailed in
		a second.

	And a flash of Nick's horrified face at the Screamer reaches
	him...

	Alex's face, grim and determined...

EXT.  LEVEL FIVE, ARCTIC WASTES -- LATER

Alex glides to a stop even as her wrist display starts to BEEP.  This time
a wooden doorway is standing directly in front of her, the golden key
sticking out of the lock.

As Alex reaches for it, the Screamer enters Level Four. Alex slowly opens
the door.

				ALBERT'S VOICE (V.O.)
		You can get a free life on Level Four, but
		you have to wait for the last possible
		instant...

Alex turns and waits calmly for the Screamer.

THE SCREAMER

is a black speck on the horizon, then a bullet, then a nightmarish face
bearing down on her...

IT'S JAWS

flare open to engulf her.

Alex doesn't flinch at all.  And at the last possible second before
impact...

BLINK!  A stylized figure appears on her wrist-display next to the "TIME
ELAPSED" meter.  Beneath the figure it says "FREE LIFE".

Alex feels the breath of the Screamer on her face and falls back through
the doorway...

"LEVEL SIX -- SHOCK CORRIDOR"

								CUT TO:

INT.  LEVEL SIX, SHOCK CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Alex steps out of a doorway into a long, narrow hallway. The hallway is
mirrored on one side.  It has no doors or windows, and up ahead, it
branches off to the right and the left.

Alex turns and looks behind her.  The doorway she came through is gone
now.  A mirrored wall stands in its place, with her own reflection staring
back at her.

THE REFLECTION

There are subtle changes.  They shouldn't be noticeable at first, but the
reflection seems somehow more threatening.

Alex starts down the hall, her reflection keeping pace with her.  Up
ahead, she hears a BUZZING noise, drawing closer.

LIGHT flickers in the hallway to the left, presumably whatever it is
that's BUZZING.  Suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor,
turns the corner and heads down the hallway towards Alex.

The light hits her feet and SPARKS fly.  Alex SCREAMS and is thrown back
against the wall, shocked.  The streak of light continues past her and
disappears into the mirror at the hall's end.  It's like a moving
electrical pulse.

ALEX

She's been given a pretty good jolt.  Her hands shake for a moment, an
after-seizure of sorts, and she stands...

HER MIRRORED REFLECTION

is watching her, arms crossed.  This wouldn't be a problem were it not for
the fact that Alex currently doesn't have her arms crossed!

				ALEX
			(to her reflection)
		Fuck you.

The reflection grins and its/her eyes GLOW with fractals.

				ALEX REFLECTION
			(in ARCADE'S voice)
		ANY TIME, BITCH.

Spooked, Alex continues down the hallway, reaching the end and turning
left...

NEW CORRIDOR

Alex moves quicker now, glancing left as her reflection follows.

BUZZZZZ!!!  Here comes another streak of light, rushing in along the floor
from a side corridor...

Alex LEAPS over it, and it passes harmlessly under her. Now she's getting
the hang of it.  She starts forward again.

BUZZZZZ!!!  Here come two at a time from opposite directions...

Alex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in the
path of the second.  Then she jumps back to the right again...

THE TWO STREAKS

pass by, zipping away from each other.

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

The pace quickens, with Alex racing down the corridors. She turns corner
after corner.  It's become a virtual maze.

We cut back to Alex's "STRENGTH" and "TIME ELAPSED" meters again and
again.  Both are shrinking away to nothing.

And all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growing
increasingly more nightmarish in appearance.  As Alex tires, the
reflection seems to gain more strength.

BUZZZZZ!!!  BUZZZZZ!!!  The streaks are shooting towards her with more
frequency, and now they're racing along the walls too.  Alex is jumping
left and right, with SPARKS exploding around her.

THE REFLECTION

seems to be metamorphosizing.  Each time we see it/her, she looks a little
different.  What's gradually happening (as time elapses) is that Alex's
reflection is turning into The Screamer.

Alex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her.  The
corridors are filled with a constant BUZZING and flickering of light.
SPARKS fly and Alex is shocked over and over.

She stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing a
streak.  It cuts past her face, centimeters away.

BEEP!  BEEP!  BEEP!  Off goes her wrist display!  Alex is up and running
now, desperate.

We cut faster and faster  Alex running, the streaks of light, the
reflection until...

END CORRIDOR

She's back where she started.  And the corridor dead-ends in a mirrored
wall...

BEHIND ALEX,

Dozens of light streaks are dogging her heels, literally just behind her.
They're so thick that she couldn't possibly leap over all of them.
Seconds before they reach her.

AHEAD OF ALEX,

the mirror shows her own reflection, rushing closer.  Her wrist display
indicates that time is up with a prolonged BEEP and her own reflection
vanishes.  It's the Screamer in her reflection's place.  Only it's
rocketing towards her in the mirror.  It's in front of her this time,
instead of behind her.

Rock and a fucking hard place.  Light streaks or Screamers?

It's really no choice at all.  Her guts says "Screamer".

Alex leaps and SMASHES into the mirror at full speed.  The world is filled
with SHATTERING GLASS and a shower of infinite reflections and then we...

								CUT TO:

EXT.  LEVEL SEVEN, PIER -- DAY

The sound of SHATTERING GLASS carried through as Alex EXPLODES out of the
sky.  And it's the sky itself that seems to be shattering...

Title reads "LEVEL SEVEN -- SEA OF DARKNESS"

ALEX

continues her fall.  She lands hard.  No blue desert sand to cushion her
here.  It takes her a moment to rise...

Alex is on a slat-board pier extending out into a sea of black water.  The
shore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier.  Storms
clouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on the
open sea, you know what it looks like...

...the and of the world.  A strange and scary yellow/green sky presses
down on us.  It's a hurricane sky.  The calm before the storm.

ON THE HORIZON,

TWO CITIES can be seen.  Techno-cityscapes, angular and metallic-looking,
towers jutting up from the sea like knives.

AT THE END OF THE PIERS

are two boats.  Standing in them are two pale-faced, cloaked FIGURES.
Like Charon, the boatman on the river Styx.

Somewhere off in the distance, the RINGING can be distinctly heard now.
But Alex is preoccupied now.  As she moves down the pier, recognition
dawns on her.

It's Laurie and Stilts.  They are dressed completely in black, hair
slicked back and eyes empty.  White-faced Gothic harlequins.  Each is
holding a wooden staff, staring into space.

				ALEX
		Guys!  Oh my God...

Alex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitement
fades.  A chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like a
metronome, lulling the world into stillness.

				ALEX
			(unsure)
		Laurie?  Stilts?

Neither of them acknowledges Alex with their eyes.

				STILTS
			(like ARCADE)
		You may ask one of us a question.
		One tells the truth, and the other lies.
		Who you ask, remains your discretion.
		But if the answer is wrong,
		the questioner dies.

Laurie motions to the techno-cities behind her.

				LAURIE
			(like ARCADE)
		One of these cities, is the place you seek.
		The Teller of Truths will take you there.
		But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak.
		And death is certain if you enter, beware.

				STILTS
		I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?

				LAURIE
		I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take
		you?

Alex stares at them a moment, utterly confused.  The sky above darkens,
and the wind picks up.  She looks to the horizon, from one city to
another, then back at her friends.

				ALEX
			(horrified)
		What did he do to you?

				LAURIE
		Is that your question?

				ALEX
			(realizing)
		Wait!  No!  That's not it!

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!  Alex doesn't even need to look at her wrist display
anymore.  She begins to pace on the end of the pier, nervously glancing at
the horizon.  And yes, there's the FLASH followed by the SHRIEK/SONIC
BOOM.

				ALEX
			(to herself)
		Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth,
		and the Truth Teller is from there...but
		which one is which?  The liar...think!

				LAURIE
		You have no time.  What is your question?

				ALEX
			(snapping back)
		I'm thinking!

				LAURIE
		You have no time.

THE SCREAMER

is visible now, arms opening to engulf Alex.  Talk about pressure.

				ALEX
			(she stops pacing)
		The liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar...

Alex rushes over to Stilts.

				ALEX
		Liar.  Did you come from the city on the
		left, or the city on the right?

				STILTS
			(pointing)
		I came from the city on the left.

				ALEX
			(grins)
		But you always lie, so you didn't come from
		there.  That means the city on the left must
		be the City of Truth.

THE SCREAMER

has reached the pier now, rocketing over the wooden slats and shaking the
entire structure...

Alex turns to Laurie.

				ALEX
			(quickly)
		Take me to the city on the left!

Laurie nods and steps aside, making room for Alex to climb into the boat.
She does and...

THE SCREAMER

dissipates just before it reaches Alex.  It turns into mist and vanishes,
the HOWL lingering as an echo long after the Screamer itself has gone.

At once, the boat begins to glide through the water, away from the pier.
Alex gets a last glimpse of Stilts standing in his boat, diminishing as
Alex and Laurie move away from him.  He looks like the loneliest person in
the world.

"LEVEL EIGHT -- CITY OF TRUTH"

EXT. LEVEL SEVEN, OPEN SEA -- LATER

As Alex and Laurie near the city, its features become more apparent.  It
is truly a Necropolis, black and angular. It's a shadow on the sunset
horizon, empty of all life and looming above them.

Just then, Alex hears a tiny VOICE.

				VOICE
			(weak)
		Help...help me...

A SMALL FIGURE

bobs in the water about fifty yards in front of them.  It waves it's hands
frantically, sinking below the water's surface, then rising once again.
It's a little BOY.

Alex's boat is going to pass right by the boy.  She grabs hold of the
gunwale and reaches out for him...

				ALEX
		Grab my hand!

Their hands lock and Alex YANKS the boy out of the water as the boat
cruises by.

THE BOY

can't be more than seven or eight.  Small and frail-looking, he shivers in
her arms.

				BOY
			(terrified)
		Where are we?

Just then the boat comes to a CRASHING stop, slamming into the black rocks
which the city rests on.  Alex and the boy are violently pitched forward
and out of the boat.

They land roughly on a beach of black gravel.  Alex turns.

LAURIE

stands in the boat.  In an instant, night has fallen.  She is a silhouette
in the moonlight.

				LAURIE
			(in a voice like Death)
		The City of Truth.

And Laurie literally fades before their eyes.  In her place, is a small
golden key.

Alex snatches up the key.  Alex turns back to the boy and...

INT. LEVEL EIGHT, CONCRETE WASTELAND -- NIGHT

...Alex and the boy are now standing on the top of a concrete incline.  It
extends downward into a system of tunnels and viaducts.  The RINGING
starts immediately, followed by the FLASH on the horizon.  Time's already
up. The little boy reaches for Alex's hand, frightened.

				ALEX
		How did you get here?  Did you play the
		game?!

				BOY
		Yes...

				ALEX
		Thought so.

Alex removes pulls her Thrasher board from her back and drops it on the
lip of the incline.  There's a FLASH and the board has changes into a
motorcycle.  A sleek black one.

				ALEX
		Can you hang onto my back?

The little boy nods.  He knows that Alex is his only chance of getting out
of here.  Nevertheless, we can tell that he's terrified.  Alex kneels down
next to him.  The wind around them has picked up and the RINGING
increases.  High-pitched, stabbing into our brains.

				ALEX
			(over noise)
		There's a monster here.  We have to kill it
		before we can leave.  That's what we have
		to do.  I know it's scary, but I won't let
		anything happen to you.  Okay?

The boy nods again.

				BOY
		Then we'll go home?

				ALEX
		Then we'll go home.

Alex's wrist display starts BEEPING and...BOOM!  The RINGING is replaced
by the Screamer's shriek.  In the distance, the Screamer is a fireball
spiraling towards the city.

Alex jumps on the motorcycle and pulls the boy up.  He crawls behind her
and hugs her back tightly.

				ALEX
			(pulling down her visor)
		Here goes everything.

She fingers the throttle and the cycle ROARS to life.  It rockets off the
incline and down into the tunnels.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

as Alex maneuvers the cycle through a forest of concrete. It's a harrowing
ride, as her headlight reveals little of what's up ahead.  Somewhere above
the tunnels, the Screamer has arrived.  In the course of the chase, it's
SHRIEK will become louder and louder as it draws closer, locating Alex.

ANOTHER CYCLE

appears out of side tunnels and a chase is on.  The RIDER is dressed in
black with glowing death's head masks.

				BOY
			(to Alex)
		Dark Riders!  If they touch us, we're dead!

The tunnels get narrower and narrower, as Alex keeps pushing the limit off
the bike.

Rider #1 tries to cut Alex off, charging forward and ramming her bike...

Alex almost loses it, but finds balance once again, sweeping left and up
the side of a circular tunnel...

RIDER #1

bites it.  His cycle careens into the wall and EXPLODES in a shower of
GREEN LIGHT.  The death's head tumbles away, spinning end over end.  The
Screamer BLASTS over the remains of the Rider, having entered the tunnels.

TWO MORE RIDERS APPEARS

gaining on Alex.  Rider #2 pulls a staff from his back and thrusts it
forward like a lance.  CHINK!  The staff hits Alex's rear wheel, nearly
throwing her.  The rider pulls off a gloved and reaches a glowing,
skeletal hand towards them.  Death touch.  The boy SCREAMS in terror.

UP AHEAD,

a wall is rushing to meet them.  Alex jams the breaks and slides/skids
sideways, cutting right at the last possible moment...

WHAM!!!  Rider #2 slams into the end wall, not able to negotiate the turn.
Another EXPLOSION of green and the second death's head comes tumbling
away.

Alex looks back.  There should be one Rider left, only now their are
three!  Alex guns the bike and cuts sharply to the right...

NEW TUNNEL --

Alex SCREECHES to a stop, having found yet another fork. The tunnel
branches off into two directions.  Two neon signs with arrows point in
opposite directions.

NEON SIGNS

They read, "THIS WAY" and "THAT WAY". Alex checks her wrist display.  Not
much time left.

				ALEX
		Which way?

				BOY
			(pointing)
		That way.

Alex backs up the cycle and heads down the tunnel marked "THIS WAY"
instead.

				ALEX
		Sorry.

THE TUNNEL

It narrows almost immediately.  Alex hears a ROAR, glances behind her, and
sees four death's head RIDERS on her tail. She makes another turn...

AHEAD,

is a crumbling brick wall with the words "WRONG WAY" painted in blood-red.

				BOY
			(screaming)
		It's the wrong way!

				ALEX
			(over the noise)
		In this world, wrong is right!

SUDDENLY,

the tunnel behind them flares with light, shaking like an earthquake.  The
Screamer has found them.

A KEY

hangs out from the wall, sort of like the brass ring on a merry-go-round.
Alex snags it as she sweeps by.

THE SCREAMER

rockets around the corner, twisting down the narrow tunnel.

Alex grinds the motorcycle forward for all it's worth, and the Screamer is
literally breathing down her neck.  She turns corner after corner, faster
and faster, scraping the bike into the scum-covered walls and shooting out
showers of SPARKS.  If she takes one second too long to negotiate a turn,
pauses for even an instant, the Screamer will be on them...

A CLAWED HAND

lashes out and tears away the cycle's tail-pipe.  Another hand takes out a
chunk of the seat...

THE BOY

is WAILING, curling low to avoid the Screamer's claws...

AHEAD,

the tunnel narrows to a dead-end.  Alex and the Screamer are on a
collision course.  A hundred miles an hour and gaining...

The Screamer LASHES out again, gouging a bloody gash in Alex's shoulder
and cutting clear through her armor.  It's claws sink into her flesh,
latching on.  Alex CRIES OUT in pain, her face contorted into a mask of
agony and fear. She pulls out a knife with her left hand a stabs blindly
into the monster...

THE SCREAMER

LURCHES forward onto the motorcycle and opens its jaws wide.  Black saliva
and ooze flow from it's mouth splashing over Alex's shoulder's and neck.
It's going to bite her head off.  It's going to...

Alex and the Screamer SLAM into the dead-end and a spectacular fireball of
GREEN LIGHT consumes the screen.

"LEVEL NINE -- THE GHETTO OF GREED"

								CUT TO:

EXT. LEVEL NINE, CRUMBLING HONG KONG GHETTO -- NIGHT

We're on a dark, crowded street lined by decrepit tenements which are
caving in upon themselves.

There is a flash of GREEN LIGHT.  Alex and the boy suddenly appear on the
street in a whirlwind of papers, sans motorcycle, but still sliding
forward at a good thirty miles an hour.  Were it not for their armor,
they'd be torn to shreds.  They skid to a stop under a sputtering
streetlight.

Alex and the boy are still SCREAMING.  Anguish is the word for Alex.  She
clutches her shoulder which is gushing blood and stumbles to her feet.

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!!!!!!

It's her fucking wrist display again and TIME-IS-FUCKING-UP!

Alex SCREAMS, pushed to the absolute breaking point.

BOOM!  Once again the streets begin to vibrate as the Screamer enters the
level.

				BOY
		It's here!!!

				ALEX
			(manic)
		Oh God...oh god...

THE STREETS --

Impoverished PEOPLE bustle back and forth everywhere. Alex grabs the boy's
hand and all but drags him down the darkened streets.  It becomes a mad,
blind dash through Hell.  She SMASHES into peddlers, stalls, tripping over
or knocking down everything in her path...

The SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer overwhelms everything else.  With
each level, it's gotten louder and louder. Wind is tearing down the
streets...

A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE

spins out of the shadows, landing in front of them.  It's a Ninja, two
swords spinning in its hands.

Instinctively, Alex reaches to her side, and sure enough, there's a gun
there now.  She unholsters it and FIRES in a blind panic.

BLAM!  Down goes the Ninja #1, spouting blood from its chest.

THWUNK!  THWUNK!!!  Two throwing stars imbed themselves into Alex's
chest-plate...

...and Jesus-fucking-Christ, Ninjas are crawling out of the wood-work!
They dive out of the shadows, weapons spinning and glistening in the
moonlight.  Throwing stars are flying like hail now, CLINKING! into the
concrete walls behind Alex and the boy...

				ALEX
		Shit!!!

ALEX

spins around, shooting indiscriminately into the crowd of bodies.  BLAM!
BLAM!  BLAM!  Ninjas fall right and left, but in no time, twice as many
move in to take their place. They're like the hornet's nest of Alien
monsters, black-clad shadows creeping towards them.

A shot hits the streetlight above, casting a sputtering, strobing light
over the whole scene and adding to the chaos.

The world is shaking apart.  It's the end of everything. It's flashes of
light and noise, nightmares and blood, chaos heaped on chaos...

Alex FIRES her gun again and again and again...

...and in the midst of this mess, here comes the Screamer again.  It
shoots down the street like a guided missile.

Alex stumbles.  The Boy drags at her arm, trying to pull her up...

				THE BOY
		Come on!!!

Alex is crying, hysterical.  She turns and sees the Screamer bearing down
on her, just like Nick did before her was ripped to shreds.

The boy is yelling something.  Alex focuses...

				THE BOY
		The doorway!  It's here!!!

THE BOY

is pulling back a manhole cover.  BLUE LIGHT  issues up from below.
Before Alex can stop him, the boy disappears down the hole.

Alex has one last chance.  She throws herself at the hole even as the
Screamer reaches her.  A clawed hand wraps around her leg.  Alex FIRES
into the hand.  The hand is severed!  She's falling!  Falling into
darkness...

"LEVEL TEN -- BAD BRAINS"

								CUT TO:

EXT.  LEVEL TEN, TECHNO-SKYSCRAPER -- NIGHT

ON ALEX AND THE BOY

as they blink into existence on this level.  Alex rises, shaking badly.
Her armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's
impossible to tell who's blood, though.  She looks like she's just walked
out of a slaughter-house.

A bone-jarring HUMMING is heard.  Alex turns...

ARCADE'S BRAIN

looms over her, all glass and black steel.  It reaches into the sky and
keeps on going.  Massive.  Tendrils of crackling ENERGY race up and down
it, BUZZING.  And as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely
appears to be alive.

TWO GLASS DOORS

swing open in invitation.  A red carpet rolls out from within the
building, rolling by itself.  Emerald City time. The carpet unfurls
completely, ending just at Alex's feet.

Above the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time,
"THIS...IS...THE...PLACE".  Fucking-A.

Alex offers a tired, near-maddened laugh.  It's all she can do anymore.

THE BOY

looks up at Alex, frightened.

				BOY
		We have to go in there, don't we?

Alex nods.  She takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet
towards the entrance of ARCADE'S brain.

INT.  LEVEL TEN, ARCADE'S BRAIN -- NIGHT

Inside, the lobby is a cacophony of LIGHT and SOUND.  We hear HUNDREDS OF
VOICES at once...whispering...fading in and out...  It's like channels
being changed.  A snippet of an opera here, maybe Bugs Bunny's voice
there...RAP MUSIC, COUNTRY MUSIC, a woman in the throes of orgasm, Nazis
screaming "HEIL HITLER!", anything and everything.

SIGNS BLINK ON AND OFF...

Catchy phrases like, "THIS IS MY BRAIN AND WELCOME TO IT", and "I THINK,
THEREFORE, I'M FUCKED" flash before us.

T.V. MONITORS

are everywhere, displaying an endless array of STATIC.  And now the
monitors are displaying FRACTALS.  Every single one of them.  We hear the
CELLOS, like an orchestra tuning up.

ALEX

throws her hands over her ears as the SOUNDS become unbearable.

				ALEX
			(top of her lungs)
		SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She pulls out her gun at FIRES into the SOUNDS and IMAGES. Shooting the
fuck out of everything.  Monitor screens shatter, glass flies and...

...just like that, total silence descends.  One by one, the lights blink
off, and it's dark once again.

INT. LEVEL TEN, THE NIGHT ROOM --

A SPOTLIGHT

comes on, isolating Alex.  The boy stands behind her, and everything else
is dark.  It's impossible to tell how large the room is.  It might go on
forever.

MORE LIGHTS

come on now, pin-point spots illuminating the faces of her friends.
They're all there...Stilts, Laurie, the others. Even Nick.  They sit in
rows, motionless...a peanut gallery.  It's eerie as hell.

And now, Alex sees something else, Greg.  He's encased in a block of ice.
A frozen prince.  And in his hands he holds a sword.  The sword is very
unusual.  The hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows RED as if it had
just pulled from a furnace.  Alex realizes that the sword is ARCADE'S
heart.

Alex moves towards Greg.  As she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved
into the ice.

Alex knows what to do.  She withdraws her belt on which the nine golden
keys are attached.  Removing the keys, Alex begins to fit them
together...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a
single, greater key.

THE KEY

Alex fits it into the keyhole and turns it.

THE CASE OF ICE

splits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. Inside, Greg is
frozen still, clutching the sword.  Alex pulls the sword out of his stiff
grip, lifting it up.

				ALEX
			(looking around)
		Okay.  I'm here, ARCADE. Where are you?

No answer.  Alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness.

				ALEX
			(shouting)
		Where are you, damnit?!

Her voice echoes in the cavernous room.

				ARCADE (O.S.)
		RIGHT HERE, BITCH.

Alex spins around and...

THE BOY

stands before her.  He grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light.
We can hear him BREATHING now, just like before.  Just like the game.

				ALEX
			(stunned)
		You...you're ARCADE?  But the donor...

				ARCADE/BOY
		...WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR OLD BOY.  YOU SEE,
		MOMMY USED TO BEAT ME.  MOMMY THREW ME DOWN
		A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEN I WENT TO SLEEP
		FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, AND WHEN I WOKE UP,
		I WAS HERE, AND I WASN'T ME ANYMORE...
			(shivers)
		...AND I FUCKED MOMMY UP GOOD...

ARCADE begins to change, shaking and ROARING as something black and
insect-like bursts out of the boy's skin.  It claws at its face, ripping
the flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath.

Nothing could have prepared Alex for this.  It/ARCADE rises above her and
it takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming.  Somehow, Alex
finds a reserve of strength.

Alex swings the sword and...

ARCADE SMASHES it aside.  It CLATTERS to the floor, useless.  But that's
academic now as a gnarled hand clamps around Alex's throat.

ARCADE lifts Alex into the air and SLAMS her against a wall, pinning her
there.  He thrusts his face into hers.

				ARCADE
		YOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
		TOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.  YOU
		SEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART
		FOR ME.  I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.  THOSE
		ARE THE RULES.  BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT,
		I'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY
		PROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD.  THANK-YOU, ALEX.
		THANK-YOU SO MUCH.

ARCADE slowly squeezes her throat and Alex chokes, gasping for air that
isn't forthcoming.  Tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red.  She
tries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't...

HER P.O.V.

as she sees the faces of her friends.  Frozen.  Unable to help.  Then the
images swirl and Alex begins to lose consciousness.

				ARCADE
		YOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T
		BEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN.

ARCADE drops Alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags
her across the floor...

A DOORWAY

stands in the darkness.  ARCADE rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness
beyond.  It's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality.
It sucks the air into it, light...everything.  It touches some sort of
primal fear. Gut instinct.  You don't ever want to go to this place. Ever.

				ALEX
			(screaming)
		No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

She twists madly, trying to pull away, but ARCADE is too strong.  He
shoves her through the doorway.  Her hands briefly latch onto the
doorjamb.  ARCADE violently kicks her and her hands slip away.  They slip
and she tumbles through.

ARCADE slams the door shut.

				ARCADE
		GOODBYE, ALEX.  IT'S BEEN REAL.

These words appear on the screen, "FINAL LEVEL -- THE REAL WORLD"

								CUT TO:

INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY

Alex lands on the hallway floor, disoriented.  Somewhere, we can hear a
clock TICKING.  But other than that the house is silent, in stark contrast
to the storm of sounds a moment ago.

THE HOUSE

looks just like the dream/flashback we saw earlier. Everything is white.
Bright and dreamlike.  Hyper reality. Alex looks up and...

ANOTHER ALEX

is sitting in a chair nearby, back straight, hands clasped in her lap.
Reserved.

				OTHER ALEX
		Time.  That's all I ever think about
		anymore.  It's like there's never enough of
		it, you know?

The other Alex vanishes.  Now the chair is empty.  Alex turns to look down
the long hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the open door.  A door
we've seen before.  The words fade in like phantoms...

				MAN (V.O.)
		So where are you then?

				ALEX (V.O.)
		I'm in the past.

				ALEX
			(a whisper)
		No ... oh no ...

With a building sense of dread, Alex moves towards that doorway.  She
stops at the threshold, terrified.

INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

Everything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight
streaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases.
Everything looks perfect.

We turn with Alex.  Ever so slowly.  Over to the right and the entranceway
of the bathroom.  Over to where her mother is...

...seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth!

				ALEX'S MOM
		Hi, honey.

HER MOTHER

looks beautiful.  Eyes sparkling.  Alive and vital.

Alex can't believe what she's seeing.  Immediately, tears come to her eyes
and her voice falters...

				ALEX
		Mom?
			(uncomprehending)
		You're alive...

				ALEX'S MOTHER
		Of course I am.

				ALEX
		But I don't understand...

				ALEX'S MOTHER
		I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much
		to be with you...

Tears are running freely down Alex's face now.

				ALEX'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave.
		You know that, don't you?

				ALEX
			(nodding)
		Yes...but...how did you...

Her mother looks ecstatic.  And now there are tears in her eyes.  Joy,
reunion...it's unclear which.

				ALEX'S MOTHER
		Magic.  We'll be together again.
			(beat)
		I know you don't believe in an afterlife,
		but there is one.  Heaven is real.

Alex looks around her.  It's all too much to take in.  Her mother.  Back
in her own home.  Sunlight is streaming in, bathing everything around her
in gold and the moment is crystallized.  A still-life.  Forever.

				ALEX
		Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?

				ALEX'S MOTHER
		Not yet, honey...

Her mother stands and Alex sees that she is holding a gun...no, the gun,
in her hands.  She raises at Alex.

				ALEX'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		...but I can fix that.

Alex has no time to respond.  A still-born scream is frozen in her throat.
A split-second of realization.  And then her mother FIRES the gun...

CRACK!  The bullet hits Alex square in the forehead, snapping her head
back as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward.  The world spins
to a stop, like a record player running down.

Alex is killed instantly.  Her body collapse, head thumping
unceremoniously against the carpeted floor.

HER EYES

open and fixed on infinity.  No life here.  Seems hard to believe that
there ever was.

								CUT TO:

INT. LEVEL NINE, THE NIGHT ROOM --

ON ALEX'S FACE

There is no bullet-hole in her forehead, but her eyes are just as
lifeless.

THE PEANUT GALLERY

Row after row of frozen faces.  Are they aware that Alex has died?  Is
there consciousness inside those skulls?

ON ARCADE

as he crouches over Alex's body.  A smile creeps across his face.

				ARCADE
		OH ALEX.  SO SORRY.  BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,
		I'LL BRING YOU BACK IN THE GAME.  MAYBE
		I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU HEAVEN.

He laughs.

ALEX'S BODY

begins to decompose in front of us, skin sinking in and shriveling up.  In
moments, she's just a husk.

ARCADE rears back, and is about to turn away, when something catches his
eye.  He hears a tiny BEEPING.

ALEX'S WRIST MONITOR

Remember the stylized symbol of a woman?  The one that said "FREE LIFE"
beneath it?  Well it disappears now.

There's a sudden FLASH behind ARCADE and he spins around..

ANOTHER ALEX

is standing behind him. and she's got the heart/sword in her hands!

				ALEX
		Guess what, ass-hole?  You forgot about my
		free life!!!

She DIVES forward, thrusting the sword with all her might. It sinks into
ARCADE'S chest and she pushes further, burying it up to the hilt.

ARCADE lets loose the most terribly SCREAM we've ever heard.  It literally
shakes world.

THE SWORD

is glowing like molten lava.  The heart-shaped hilt burns into the
monster's chest, spreading crackling fire over his entire body.  His body
is immersed fire now, vibrating like mad and suddenly...

...ARCADE EXPLODES IN A FIREBALL OF GREEN LIGHT AND...

...he's gone.  Like he never existed.  The sword drops to the floor, a
gun-metal gray now.

Alex stands there a moment, stunned, not quite willing to believe that
she's won.

A NEON SIGN

above her drops down.  It flashes "CONGRATULATIONS" over and over again.
"CONGRATULATIONS".

ALEX

looks down at herself.  She feels odd.  Something is happening.  She's
fading out, as if she were a signal being lost.  Her image stutters,
flickers and...

								CUT TO:

INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT

Alex FLASHES back into the real world. And then one by one, so do the
others.

It's a glorious sight.  Each one is heralded by BUZZING STATIC, and then a
rippling in space, an image stuttering in and...

POP!  POP!  POP!  One after another come FLASHING back in bursts of light!
There are dozens.  The Inferno is filled with them, like a flurry of
flashbulbs going off.  Familiar faces and people we've never seen.  Benz,
Laurie, Stilts, DeLoach...

POP!  And there's Nick!  And more, and still more!  Forty, fifty...  Just
how many people did ARCADE take?

Everyone is grinning, crying, hugging one another.

SPACE SHIMMERS

just before Alex.  SOMEONE else is trying to fight their way back.  It's
Greg.  He's blinking back into reality.

				ALEX
			(crying)
		Greg!!!

He flickers for a moment, tentative...

				GREG
			(fading in and out)
		Alex!  You did it!

...and then he's back for good.  He wraps his arms around Alex, grabbing
her so tight that it's almost painful.  Both of them are sobbing.

				GREG
			(in between kisses)
		You did it...

Together, the two of them start towards the door, eager to leave this
place.

In groups of twos and threes, the others follow.

EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAWN

Outside, light is just beginning to creep its way back into the world.
Alex glances up and can't help but notice the streetlight fading out as
the sun returns.  She points and laughs.

WE BEGIN TO RISE UP,

as Nick and the others join them.  Everyone is laughing now.  It's
uncontrollable.  This is positive.  Life affirming.  And hell, we should
probably wrap this thing up on that note.

We should...

...but we won't.

WE WATCH

as a series of dissolves portray the crowd of people leaving, bit by bit,
until only our original group is left.

THE GROUP

as they make their way down the street and away from The Inferno.

				GREG
		So how did you do it, Alex?

				ALEX
		Well, it's a long story...

Alex catches Nick's eye briefly, and he smiles.  Whatever happened between
them is over now.  Friends again.

Suddenly Alex stops in her tracks, a look of concern washing over her
face.

				NICK
		What is it?

				ALEX
		I just thought of something.  If we came
		back from the game...
			(turning to Nick)
		...what if ARCADE did too?

A beat as the group mulls it over.  Then Greg shakes his head.

				GREG
		Nah.  You won, right?  You played by the
		rules.

Greg's right.  Alex grins and dismisses the thought.

				ALEX
		Okay.  Forget I ever said it.

The group moves away from us once more.

				STILTS
		So start at the beginning...

				LAURIE
		Give her a chance, will you?

				STILTS
		I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you
		get off my back?

				GREG
			(annoyed)
		Guys...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY

We are moving slowly through the empty arcade, ducking around and between
video machines until we reach the silent ARCADE prototype.

SUDDENLY,

SPARKS appear on the ground nearby, chasing each other around and
coalescing into a ball.  ENERGY crackling. SOMETHING is flickering in and
out at an incredible rate. BUZZING.  STATIC.  And...

WHAM!!!  A FLASH OF LIGHT EXPLODES OUTWARD.

A FORM

rises up from the floor, still trailing tendrils of smoke. It lifts its
head.

THE BOY

stares directly at us, eyes glowing like nuclear reactors. And inside
those eyes we see the swirling fractals.  He grins, flashing a mouthful of
perfectly white teeth.

				ARCADE/BOY
		KISS REALITY GOODBYE, SUCKERS.

And we...

								CUT TO:

Darkness.

				   THE END
